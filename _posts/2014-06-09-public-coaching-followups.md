So it's time for the three-week followups. If you're just joining us in our program, I'll get you caught up. A few weeks ago I did a drawing for free public coaching sessions, and posted them publicly. Now, three weeks later, I'm following up with them to see if their poker games have improved, and what we can do to sustain positive changes going forward.

Well, I recently finished the last followups, and to say the least, I was completely blown away. If you were wondering how Scott, Yaro, and João did after their coaching sessions, you might be surprised to see how drastic the changes were!

**[Scott C](https://haseebq.com/public-coaching-session-scott-c/)** was $2/$5 grinder who was struggling with motivation to play, tilt, and confidence problems. In the 3-week followup, he claims some pretty amazing life changes–you have to listen to believe it. Direct link is [here](http://yourlisten.com/HaseebQ/scott-c-followup).

**[Yaroslav](https://haseebq.com/public-coaching-session-yaroslav/)** was a $200NL-$1kNL HU grinder who was struggling with rampant emotional problems. He had angry outbursts, tilted easily, and was unable to forgive his own mistakes. In this followup, he admits that he used to believe that all of these were simply part of his personality, but now he's realized otherwise–in fact, he claims he feels like he's already felt huge changes.

### ♠

**[João](https://haseebq.com/public-coaching-session-joao/)** was a mid-stakes MTT grinder who was trying to transition into live tournaments. He was struggling with the transition to playing live tournaments, specifically with boredom, anxiety, and positivity at the tables. In the intervening three weeks, he observed dramatic changes in his mental game–along with dramatic tournament results.

All in all, I'm really happy with how all of these guys ended up, and I wish them nothing but the best in the future. I was lucky to have chosen three people who were as dedicated and steadfast as these three–they all have strong potential as poker players. Who knows, you might be hearing a lot more of their names in the near future. :)
