Yesterday morning I just left Ljubljana, where I was living for over a week. It has probably been my favorite city thus far. The people there are so friendly, the food is so great, the pace of life is just so relaxed and wonderful&hellip;There's so much I could say about this place. But for once I'll let the photos do the talking.

The hostel I was staying in, Hostel Celica, is a landmark of Metelkova. Metelkova used to be a military barracks during the war, and Celica was its prison. It has since been renovated by Slovenian artists, every cell containing a different design. This is the cell I slept in for several nights.

But yesterday morning I left Ljubljana. Today I just arrived in a town called Albi in the south of France. From there, my two hosts picked me up and drove me out to a little house in the countryside. In exchange for a room and three meals a day, I will be working on their farm for the next three weeks.

This is something I've been thinking about for a while, but a couple of weeks ago I decided to give it a try. I've never worked a real job before&mdash;I've been playing poker professionally since I was 16&mdash;and I've never lived out in the country. The nearest village is 10 kilometers away; the farm itself is over 50 acres. Over the next few weeks I imagine I will have a lot of time to reflect, to sweat, to write, and hopefully to brush up on some French while I'm at it.

It is quiet here.

I will write more&mdash;probably a lot more&mdash;about it next time. For now, I need to sleep&hellip;breakfast is at 8AM tomorrow morning. Grumble.
