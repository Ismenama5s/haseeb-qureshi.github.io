Hey guys,

So the applications came in, and I selected a few people for the public coaching sessions. Thanks to everyone who wrote in! I have a few big names in store for the public coaching. It's going to be exciting, so stay tuned.

I'm going to be posting the coaching sessions one at a time. You're likely to pick up a lot of the techniques and resources I use with many of my clients to deal with common issues, such as tilt, anxiety, motivation, etc., as well as hear their interesting stories. Today we're starting with the first candidate, a very awesome guy by the name of **Scott C.**

Scott is a live $2/$5 grinder who wrote in telling me that he was going through a rough downswing. It'd been affecting his confidence, causing him to tilt, and making him dread coming to the tables. I listened to his story, diagnosed the problems, and came up with a step-by-step plan to start resolving his issues.

This session focuses a lot on **tilt**, **motivation to play**, and **confidence**. Give it a listen. ([External link here.](http://yourlisten.com/HaseebQ/scott-c-initial-session))
