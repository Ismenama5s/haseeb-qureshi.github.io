Blockchain development is white-hot right now. Since getting into this space, I've gotten lots of people reaching out to me asking for how to get into this space. Consider this my authoritative guide on how to become a blockchain engineer.

## Wait, why should I do blockchain development?

Blockchain is obviously very hot right now. It's also obviously a massively overvalued space at the moment—almost everyone recognizes that it's in a bubble, and a correction is coming. This will definitely happen, as it has happened before, but blockchains and cryptocurrencies are massively important technologies and are absolutely going to matter in 10 years. So I think you should get into this space now. There are five main reasons why you should get into blockchain development:

1. It's very early. Bitcoin was launched in 2009 which launched the age of cryptocurrencies—almost a decade ago now. But the rate of innovation has only reached a fever pitch in the last couple of years, especially with the launch of Ethereum in 2015. Most of the new companies and ideas in this space have been built on top of Ethereum. Ethereum itself is basically brand new and its ecosystem is still just starting to solidify.

Even if you get into this space right now, you'll be very early. You can realistically become a world-class expert within a few years, analogous to deep-learning experts who began studying the topic in the late 2000s.

2. This space doesn't have a good funnel yet. Most of the best and brightest students at universities are getting into web, or AI, or other domains. Blockchains are getting more sexy, but they're still weird and subversive. Early on, blockchain was the realm of cypherpunks, paranoids, and weirdos. Just by being a curious and open-minded developer, you'll have an edge on the field.

3. It's a space where academia isn't leading the charge. Satoshi Nakamoto was, as far as we know, not an academic. There's no university or institution that offers a coherent concentration on blockchain yet. Most of the innovation here has been led by individuals and independent researchers, and everything you need to know is in white papers, blog posts, and code that's available for free. You can just roll up your sleeves and jump in. So do it!

4. The demand far, far outstrips supply. Everyone is competing to hire blockchain talent, and this effect is everywhere. People literally can't keep up or pay people enough to let them stay. Experts are continually bombarded with job offers. If you get some experience, it's insanely easy to land a job.

5. It's really fucking cool. Where else can you build sci-fi futuristic stuff like this? There's so much innovation and experimentation, it's genuinely one of the fastest and most innovative spaces you can be in right now. It's the wild west, and the space could use a strong dose of regulation—but there's no question that cryptocurrencies are pushing the leading edge of cryptography, distributed systems, and economic experimentation.

Let's say you're convinced. What do you need to know before you get into the ring?

# What are the prerequisites?

## Computer science
1. Algorithms and data structures (linked lists, binary search trees, tries, hash maps)
2. Cryptography (public/private key crypto, hashing, Merkle trees)
3. Distributed systems (consensus protocols, fault tolerance, BFT)
4. Networking (TCP/UDP, how Internet routing works, gossip protocols)

## Economics
1. Game theory — don't need to go super deep here, just get the basics. Not necessary to understand super complex equilibria.
2. Macroeconomics, monetary policy, etc.

# What should you do?

## Understand the basics
* First, understand what a blockchain is.
  - Good introductions here:
* Then, build one.
  - Here's some good resources: (my video here)
* Once you've built a blockchain, you should delve into Ethereum. Ethereum is the most important project, as it has the most code built on top of it, is where the majority of ICOs take place, etc.
  - Here's a good intro.
  - Now you want to build a few small projects using Remix (the in-browser IDE)
    - Start with a token
    - Now do a coinflip game (need to use commit-reveal to figure this out)
    - Now build a voting system — this like the TodoApp of Ethereum
  - Now you're ready to build more serious stuff. Try out this and this. Cryptozombies etc. fun fun!
  - Now also do Ethernaut and HackThisContract to practice your security skills! Smart contract security is critical. Read this and do this.
  - You should move past Remix at this point. I recommend VSCode/Atom + Solidity plugins + TestRPC + Truffle.
* Now go here, here, or here. Look at Gitcoin and find some places to contribute to active projects! Here are a list of a few high-quality projects that welcome open-source contributors (0x, Dharma, Aragon, etc.?)
* Go here, here, or here and start advertising your skills! Blog and contribute things you learn! Publish cool stuff! Lots of awesome Slack groups you can join to start discussing stuff, such as X, Y, and Z.
