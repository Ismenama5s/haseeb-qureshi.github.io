I've just now gotten internet access again since when I posted my last blog entry. Cologne is an interesting and beautiful city (although I've met a few locals who seem to think it's a boring place… but I guess that's true of everywhere to the people who are used to it). I visited the Dom cathedral, the Roman-Rhineland Museum, and walked along the Rhine river for several miles. My feet hurt like hell (I need better shoes, will probably buy some new ones when I get to Prague), but it was an amazing walk. It started raining after a couple hours, and though I instinctively started heading for what looked like shelter, when it slowed to a drizzle I just started wandering around aimlessly in the streets. Reading back over how I spent my day I sound like I'm crazy, but it was good, haha.

While I was wandering around I met a sweet German girl who spoke good English and became fast friends with her. She showed me around the nightlife of Cologne and took me through the vibrant gay district. I did not know this, but apparently Cologne is the gay capital of Germany! Maybe it's telling me something&hellip;

Anyway, I took today what I think is the most badass photo I've ever taken ever. I'm seriously very proud of this one, although it was just a stroke of luck and it's cropped from the original photo, but still. After I took the photo she scolded me and said, &ldquo;hey, this is my job!&rdquo; so I paid her a euro, but it was worth it, haha. Some other good photos today.

I've been thinking about a lot of shit lately and I appreciate all of the comments you guys have written. I'm trying to use this blog as a journal of my thoughts however they occur to me, so try not to think about what I'm writing here as completed or fully realized. It's sort of a sounding board for my consciousness, or something like that. But thanks everyone for the comments they've sent me, they've been very interesting to read.

Will write more soon,
