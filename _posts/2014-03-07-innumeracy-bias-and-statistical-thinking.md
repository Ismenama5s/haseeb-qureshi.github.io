Hey gang,

Today (after a brief hiatus due to illness), I bring a new video where I explore the innumeracy bias. The central question I explore is this: are our minds naturally built to think in terms of probabilities and ratios? (They're not, it turns out.) And if not, then what, as poker players, can we do about it?

If you have any questions, thoughts, or reflections, please leave a comment! And if you haven't checked it out already, do check out the audiobook, recently released on iTunes and [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/How-Be-Poker-Player-Philosophy/dp/B00IJHYGOM/ref=tmm_aud_title_0/190-4854978-8183141) (available for FREE if you're new to Audible).

Hope you guys enjoyed the video. If you have any idea or suggestion for a future video, don't hesitate to contact me with a suggestion. :)
