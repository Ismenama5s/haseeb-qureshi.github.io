This is a post.

I will write more when more stuff happens. I don't know my plans yet or where I am going to go, but for those of you who wish to contact or meet me, I am reachable at haseebonroad at gmail dot com. Once I decide what exactly my plans are, I will write more. Right now the first thing I could use is tips on backpacking. I am reading what I can find and getting in touch with friends who have some experience doing it, but I would love to hear the advice of others. I hope to embark on the road before next week. I plan to carry nothing more than a backpack with me, and I don't intend to fly anywhere. I am leaving most of what I brought with a friend in Nottingham, since I won't need most of it.

As of now, the only plan is to make it to the Czech republic by September to meet up with a friend who will be there. So, I will probably trek south, take the ferry to France, and then start going east.

I haven't been sleeping well for the last week, so that's probably the first step.
