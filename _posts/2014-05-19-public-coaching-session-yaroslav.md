Hey guys,

Have had a number of people tell me they got a lot out of hearing the [first coaching session](https://haseebq.com/public-coaching-session-scott-c/) I did with Scott C. Well today I finished my first session with the second candidate, a grinder from Belarus named **Yaroslav**.

Yaroslav is an online HU $200NL-$1000NL grinder who wrote in telling me that he had a lot of anger and tilt issues. He said he was a pretty emotional person in his general life, but wanted to learn how to control those emotions in poker. He'd broken mouses, keyboards, and mugs in outbursts of anger.

This session focuses on **anger**, **hot tilt**, **relaxation exercises**, **making mistakes**, and **how to optimize learning**. Give it a listen. ([External link here](http://yourlisten.com/HaseebQ/yaroslov-initial-session).)

[Note: there is a bit of noise in the beginning sometimes when Yaro speaks, but it goes away pretty soon.]
