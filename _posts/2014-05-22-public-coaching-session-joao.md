Strap in, because it's time for coaching session #3.

**João** is an MTT grinder whose average tourney buyin is around $150. He's a strong player online, and even took 2nd in several of this year's SCOOP events, but his primary issues were in live poker–particularly, he wanted to make the transition to playing more live tourneys. His challenges were that he got bored easily, would get anxious when his stack fluctuated, and seem to make significantly worse decisions in live games in live games.

This session deals primarily with **boredom**, **transitioning to live games**, and **dealing with anxiety**. Give it a listen. ([External link here](http://yourlisten.com/HaseebQ/joao-initial-session).)
