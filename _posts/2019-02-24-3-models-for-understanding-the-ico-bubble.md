We can safely say the ICO bubble is over now.

The ICO bubble was the event that singularly put crypto on the world stage. I won’t bore you with recounting the details—you were there, you saw it, and if you’re reading this, you probably took part in it.

There’s already been enough hand-wringing and I-knew-it-all-alongs. What I want to do in this essay is answer a different question—one that, in truth, it’s too early to really answer.

**Why did the ICO bubble happen?**

![World among worlds](https://i.imgur.com/qFvYiQN.png)

It’s important here to get a sense of scale. $6B was raised through ICOs in 2017 and $8B in 2018 (those numbers are fuzzy, depending on what you count as “raised”). By comparison, the [seed and angel-stage dollars](https://news.crunchbase.com/news/q4-2018-closes-out-a-record-year-for-the-global-vc-market/) invested in 2017 was about $10B, and in 2018 around $15B. Though it’s a drop in the bucket compared to all stages of venture capital, which deployed around $500B during that period.

![ICO collapse](https://i.imgur.com/66rgZCT.png)

When the ICO bubble finally popped in 2018, the “market cap” of all crypto fell $700B in paper value, an 85% drop from its peak in January. This makes it worse than the dotcom bubble’s 78% collapse. But this bubble was not nearly as destabilizing—the dotcom bubble wiped out $5 trillion of value, and was more localized to the United States, whereas losses in the ICO bubble were absorbed across many more economies. (And, of course, comparing “market capitalization” in crypto to the NASDAQ is [problematic](https://medium.com/@RainDogDance/bitcoin-as-a-novel-market-institution-nic-carter-talk-at-baltic-honeybadger-2018-e085f163b213").)

# TALK ABOUT HOW THIS SEEMS UNPRECEDENTED, RIGHT? OF COURSE, NOT AT ALL.

So how can we make sense of what happened? There are, I believe, 3 major historical models that explain the ICO bubble. The first and most obvious is the dotcom bubble. The second is the boom in penny stocks in the 90s. And the third is the advent of P2P filesharing in the late 2000s. I’ll examine each in turn, and demonstrate how different aspects of what happened in the ICO bubble call back to events in each of these historical precedents.

History does not repeat—but there are a few refrains it loves to come back to.

# I. Technological Bubbles

> All bubbles are about greed… but some bubbles are also about the installation of technological revolutions. *– Carlota Perez*

Carlota Perez is the patron saint of venture capitalists. Her seminal work, *Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital* has been been cited by [Marc Andreessen](http://fortune.com/2014/02/13/marc-andreessen-tech-is-recovering-from-a-depression/) and [Fred Wilson](https://avc.com/2015/02/the-carlota-perez-framework/) as key to understanding the tech industry.

I won’t do her book justice here, but I’ll attempt to summarize the key ideas in the book that are relevant to crypto. I’ll be quoting heavily from Carlota herself—as you read, you’ll probably cringe at the parallels.

## Innovation moves in cycles
Carlota Perez subscribes to the long wave economic cycle theory, known as [Kondratiev Waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kondratiev_wave), in which technological innovation occurs in 45-60 year waves.

According to Perez, these innovation waves consist of three phases:

1. Installation
2. Collapse
3. Deployment

Installation is the period when a new technology is first explored, installed, and then speculated on. This speculation leads to an unsustainable asset bubble and a spectacular collapse. Then a more sober period of deployment takes place during which the technology matures and sustainably alters many aspects of society. After a full deployment has exhausted its potential for driving economic growth, a new innovation wave must follow and the cycle begins anew.

> There have been five technological revolutions in 240 years... Each of these revolutions drives a great surge of development and shapes growth for half a century or more.

![Carlota Perez](https://i.imgur.com/Ss36xmF.png)

Each of these revolutions was kicked off by a seminal event that would catalyze the wave—the industrial revolution with Arkwright's Cromford mill, the steam and railway age with the Liverpool-Manchester Railway, the steel and heavy engineering age with Carnegie's Bessemer steel plant, the age of automobiles with Ford's assembly line, and the computer age with Intel's 4004 microprocessor.

![K-waves summary](https://i.imgur.com/DuGafL5.png)

I would argue that the moment that kicked off the ICO bubble was the launch of Ethereum. Though it was not the first cryptocurrency, it was the first major ICO to produce astronomical returns, and it would set the rules for the frenzy that was to come.

The Ethereum blockchain launched in 2015, exactly 44 years after 1971. If K-waves are meant to be 45-60 years apart, then crypto plausibly fits neatly into her framework.

> Why call them revolutions, though? Because they go far beyond the powerful set of new industries; they also transform the whole economy by providing a new techno-economic paradigm.

What does she mean by techno-economic paradigm? Simply put, a techno-economic paradigm is a new accepted way of doing things. When a new technology takes form and begins driving innovation, it brings with it a new logic of how businesses should be structured. For example, with the advent of the automobile, the logic of the technology meant that businesses should adopt mass production, achieve economies of scale, and standardize their products for mass marketing appeal—the logic of the factory. In this paradigm, every American should own not only a mass-produced automobile, but also a TV, a refrigerator, a washing machine, etc.

> The emerging heuristic routines and approaches are gradually internalized by engineers and managers, investors and bankers, sales and advertising people, entrepreneurs and consumers. In time, a shared logic is established; a new “common sense” is accepted for investment decisions as well as for consumer choice. The old ideas are unlearned and the new ones become “normal”.

As a techno-economic paradigm becomes ascendant, any entrepreneur who does not subscribe to the new paradigm will be seen as low-status and behind the times.

![Techno-economic paradigm](https://i.imgur.com/ywCcYxa.png)

We know the techno-economic paradigm of the computer revolution—move fast and break things, launch MVPs, iterate in short cycles, pursue business models with zero marginal cost. Basically all the mantras consumed by aspiring tech founders.

Cast in these terms, the techno-economic paradigm of crypto is almost embarrassing to say out loud. Here’s what we taught founders how to build a business in the crypto age: you should shoehorn your idea into a protocol, invent a story how it will eventually be decentralized, write an academic-looking whitepaper with some math in it, create a Swiss foundation, do a public ICO, open source your code… you know the jig. Basically, cargo culting the Ethereum ICO.

In hindsight, we can acknowledge how almost none of this was predictive of an entrepreneur’s success. But founders who did not adopt this paradigm during the ICO boom were seen as low-status, and thus were less rewarded in their fundraising.

## The installation phase
If we have just witnessed the collapse phase, then it’s worth rewinding to what Perez has to say about the installation phase.

> During Installation, investment is led by financial capital, which funds the technological transformation, and, in the excitement, also intensifies its casino-type activities.

Financial capital is what Perez deems short-term return-seeking capital (as opposed to *production capital*, which is more long-term and sustainable, and characterizes the deployment phase).

> Financial capital then breaks loose, backs the new entrepreneurs, dismantles as much as it can of the institutional framework, overinvests in the new infrastructure, and also uses the new technologies to innovate in instruments for financial speculation.

This is a little too on the nose for crypto.

Dismantles institutional frameworks, check. Overinvests in new infrastructure, check. Invents new instruments for financial speculation (ICOs, SAFTs, SAFTEs), check.

## The Frenzy
Eventually all of this rises to a fever pitch in what Perez dubs "Frenzy."

> Frenzy is the tumultuous period when financial capital takes off on its own... All those benefitting from this flourishing of opportunities believe the world is going through a marvelous time.

New millionaires are minted. They want to multiply their wealth in the same way they made it, redeploying their capital with high pressure to generate more profits. They come to believe that it's their own superior insights and intuition that led to this tremendous growth. The gap between paper values and real values widen, which accelerates the diffusion of the paradigm.

(Ringing a bell?)

> As the various assets go up in price, confidence grows that they will continue to do so... Since the profits to be had are amazing, everybody—including widows and orphans—eventually becomes aware of the incredible possibilities. They gradually dare to enter what used to be alien territory, trying to get a piece of the action.

Do you remember the article [Everyone is Getting Hilariously Rich and You're Not](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/13/style/bitcoin-millionaires.html) in the NYT?

She quotes Bruce Nussbaum, writing in Business Week about the late 90s:

> "So investors accepted sky-high P/Es, puffed-up bottom lines, and some strange business plans—because who really knew what was possible? It was a time of opportunity, a time to place bets. And they paid off..."

Do you remember the nonsensical projects? The teams that no one had heard of? The copy and pasted whitepapers? All the shameless rhetoric about 1 trillion dollar TAMs and 100K transactions per second?

> ... The financiers (and the investors who trust their money to them) seem to be convinced that they have discovered the most profitable vein. They then indulge in the intense repetition of the same successful recipe, be it from canals from any river to any river, as in the first revolution, or more dot coms and telecommunications.

Do you remember all the ICO investing syndicates? The Telegram groups? The newsletters?

During Canal Mania in the 1790s, canals were created from river to river with no regard for routing, believing that canals would magically produce demand. In the 1840s, railway projects were began from place to place without regard for engineering practicality, and subsequently failed. In the 1920s, real estate values were unmoored from the constraints of urban planning because the automobile implied that any territory could be valuable if connected by roads. And of course, in the 90s, dot coms were created with no evidence of demand for their products.

None of this is new.

And of course, do you remember all the voices (some [rejoicing](https://medium.com/dash-for-newbies/crypto-the-dawn-of-the-single-greatest-wealth-transfer-in-the-history-of-mankind-bc7683ad4c), some [lamenting](https://twitter.com/RyanSAdams/status/1052566485200199681)) the new redistribution of wealth?

> The whole frenzy phenomenon is, at bottom, a huge process of income redistribution in favor of those directly or indirectly involved in the casino, which funds the massive process of creative destruction in the economy. That regressive distribution generates a double vicious cycle: one is economic, expressed in the market; the other is social, expressed in political terms. Both get worse as the bubble increases.

Of course, we cannot talk about the ICO bubble without talking about its dark side: the fraudsters, the pump and dumpers, the exit scammers.

> That permissive atmosphere generates an opacity that is highly convenient for corruption and for the flourishing of outright illegal activities... This is then a time for swindlers.

So the ICO bubble was but a variation on the theme. The players and the colors were different, but the social dynamics and human stories were the same. There were, as always, stories of overnight millionaires, flagrant scams, second and third mortgages that ended in catastrophe, all the usual human roil and ruin.

All this is to say, we've seen this before.

![Installation phase](https://i.imgur.com/7bBzPss.png)

## The aftermath
Crypto's gilded age is probably now over. Most of those newly minted millionaires have unwittingly surrendered their riches, the hype has died away, ICO funding has dried up, [SEC enforcement actions](http://fortune.com/2018/11/02/sec-ico-report-cryptocurrency-scams/) are trickling in, and the media's crush on crypto has passed.

But, Perez reminds us, the installation phase and subsequent crash is not merely painful—it is necessary to any technological revolution. The financial casino attracts the funds necessary to install basic infrastructure and facilitate social learning. Without the dotcom bubble, there would not have been all of the investments into optical fiber buildouts, new ISPs and internet infrastructure, packet-switched networks for telecoms, and all of the other social and technological infrastructure that set the stage for Internet adoption.

For crypto, there are now many world class teams well-capitalized to build, scale, and evolve blockchain technology, and tens of millions of people in the world who now understand decentralization, proof of work, and private keys. It comes at a high cost, but Perez suggests that bubbles like these are necessary to overcome technological inertia.

Ultimately, the collapse paves the way for the full unfolding of the more fruitful deployment phase.

Perez's book was written in 2003 during the nadir of the dotcom crash, from which she draws many of her examples. She is prescient in situationg the crash neatly within her K-wave framework. History has proven her exactly right—Amazon went public in 1997 at $18 a share, climbed to $300 in 1999, until it collapsed back down to $6 a share after the crash. It now trades at upwards of $1,600 a share.

Of course, we should be careful not to invert Perez's thesis: all technological revolutions create a bubble, but that does not mean all bubbles are created by a technological revolution (indeed, most aren't).

So what does Perez predict here? She predicts the logic of frenzy, the stoking of financial capital, and the rhetoric of revolution ("the future will be decentralized"). She explains the explosion of retail investors ("widows and orphans"), traditional capital piling in at dizzying prices (Telegram, Filecoin, Hashgraph), and the flood of traditional entrepreneurs contorting themselves to follow the new paradigm.

But there's another side to what we saw in the ICO bubble, which goes beyond Perez's framework. For this, we turn to our second historical model: the penny stock boom.

# II. Penny stocks

Balaji Srinivasan once claimed that tokens would turn blockchains into the world's biggest stock market. This may someday be true—but for now, tokens have become the world's biggest *penny stock* market.

The term "penny stock" evokes shady stockbrokers in boiler rooms, and for good reason. Jordan Belfort, the protagonist the 2013 film Wolf of Wall Street, made his fortune hustling as a penny stock broker.

![Wolf of Wall Street](https://i.imgur.com/3uYtZBj.jpg)

Penny stocks are defined differently in different countries and go by different names. But in the US, a penny stock is a stock issued by a small company that trades below $5 a share (originally it was stocks that traded below $1, but you know, inflation and all). They are generally quoted [OTC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp) and seldom trade on national exchanges. They have low liquidity, little public information, and do not require significant financial disclosures. As such, they tend to be easily manipulated and are plagued with fraud.

## The history of penny stocks
The legal designation of penny stocks began after the 1929 stock market crash that triggered the Great Depression. It was believed that unbridled speculation on penny stocks was one of the principal causes of the crash, which led to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 designating formal restrictions on penny stock trading.

![Night singer of shares](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Bubble.folly.jpg)

Throughout most of the 20th century, penny stock orders could only be placed via the phone. Offerings could not be legally placed in newspapers, and were mostly traded OTC. The highest quality penny stocks would provide only annual financial reporting—the very worst had none at all.

But starting in the mid-90s with the growth of the Internet, penny stock trading exploded. Penny stock discount brokers emerged, able to offer an automated interface and much lower trading fees. As retail investors flooded in, market manipulation became rampant. Eventually, federal regulators would step in, and a string of [high profile cases](https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/ts142000.htm) were brought against Mafia crime families that were involved in widespread penny stock manipulation schemes.  

By 1989, a survey found that Americans had been cheated out of [at least $2B a year by fraudulent penny stock schemes](http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-08/business/fi-1942_1_penny-stock).

It's worth taking a breath here. Why are people so drawn to penny stocks in the first place, given how fraught they are?

As a former professional poker player, I can tell you the answer is simple: people fucking love gambling. They always have and always will. Throughout history gambling has been stigmatized, regulated, and outlawed, but it always survives one way or another. People love the idea of turning around their fortunes, the rush of outsmarting the establishment. It hardly matters what the company does. Penny stocks prey on the same greedy credulity behind all get rich quick schemes.

![Penny stocks banner](https://sykes-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/images/banner-tim.jpg)

On the other side of the market, penny stocks are a gift to hustlers and scammers. For those manipulating markets, they don't care what about the stocks represent—they simply need a company, a ticker, and a story. Greed will take care of the rest.

## An embarrassment of riches
In ICOs, just as penny stocks, are a two-sided market. Investors don't care about the coins, they just want objects of speculation to get rich on. Fraudsters don't care about the coins either, they just want objects of manipulation to cheat others on. Everyone gets what they need, and so the market bustles with activity, and no one wants to be left out.

Here's a telling [article published in 2000](https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Internet-Makes-Stock-Scams-Easy-Pump-and-dump-2772185.php) Internet pump and dump schemes:

> Before the Net, these promoters hired squads of telemarketers to push their stocks on unsuspecting investors. Now, it's as easy as blasting out e-mail, or if they're industrious, maintaining a Web site.

What's the ICO

> The current fashion is to announce the discovery of a new, inexpensive method of sending broadband signals over telephone lines at speeds far exceeding existing technologies.
> The promoters issue a constant stream of press releases chronicling development breakthroughs, marketing agreements and endorsements of the technology from qualified scientists.
> Meanwhile, the stock is featured in free e-mail newsletters and on Web sites of services specializing in alerting investors to ground-floor, undiscovered opportunities to make a killing in the market.
> Optimistic posts then begin appearing on Internet stock message boards, such as those maintained by Yahoo and Raging Bull. Because few have heard of the new company, the promoters plant messages on other heavily frequented boards -- Qualcomm's, for instance. These mention the new stock, tout its hot prospects and suggest that investors check it out.
> If the promoters do a good job, and the market is strong, the stock price can soar from a few cents a share to $10, or in some cases, much more. Eventually, the share price collapses after the promoters sell out and quit pumping.
