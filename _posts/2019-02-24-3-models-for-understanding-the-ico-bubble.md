We can safely say the ICO bubble is over now.

The ICO bubble was the event that singularly put crypto on the world stage. I won’t bother recounting the story—you were there, you saw what happened, and if you’re reading this, you probably took part in it.

There’s already been enough hand-wringing and I-knew-it-all-alongs. What I want to do in this essay is answer a different question—one that, in truth, it’s too early to answer.

**Why did the ICO bubble happen?**

![World among worlds](https://i.imgur.com/qFvYiQN.png)

It’s important here to get a sense of scale. $6B was raised through ICOs in 2017 and $8B in 2018 (those numbers are fuzzy, depending on what you count as “raised”). By comparison, the [angel and seed stage dollars](https://news.crunchbase.com/news/q4-2018-closes-out-a-record-year-for-the-global-vc-market/) invested in 2017 was about $10B, and in 2018 around $15B.

![ICO collapse](https://i.imgur.com/66rgZCT.png)

When the ICO bubble finally popped in 2018, the “market capitalization” of all crypto fell $700B in paper value, an 85% drop from its peak in January. This makes it steeper than the dotcom bubble’s 78% collapse. (Though comparing the “market cap” of crypto to the NASDAQ is [problematic](https://medium.com/@RainDogDance/bitcoin-as-a-novel-market-institution-nic-carter-talk-at-baltic-honeybadger-2018-e085f163b213").)

The media gawked at this collapse. To some, the crash represented the [nail in the coffin](https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoinobituaries/) for cryptocurrencies. Many were left asking: how can we continue to believe in crypto after this?

But of course, we've seen many episodes like this before.

There are, I believe, 3 major historical precedents that explain the ICO bubble. The first is the peer-to-peer file sharing revolution in the late 2000s. The second is the boom in penny stocks in the 90s. And the third is the dotcom bubble. I’ll examine each in turn, and demonstrate how different aspects of the ICO bubble are explained by each of these historical precedents.

History does not repeat—but there are a few refrains it loves to come back to.

### LEAD WITH FILESHARING, PUT TECHNOLOGICAL BUBBLES LAST. FOR LAST ONE, ANNOUNCE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET A LITTLE ACADEMIC.
### ADD MORE HISTORICITY TO THE DOTCOM BUBBLE
### END ON OPTIMISM ABOUT DEPLOYMENT PHASE COMING!!! WHOOHOOO!!!!
### EACH PHASE SHOULD EXPLAIN _WHY_ DID THEY ALLOW ICOS TO FLOURISH. FOR PENNY STOCKS, IT WAS AS A THING TO SPECULATE ON AND RECREATE THE SAME DYNAMIC WITHOUT REGULATION.

# I. The file sharing revolution

P2P file sharing networks were the first world-scale decentralized networks. Bitcoin's gossip-based networking model was inspired by Gnutella (the protocol behind LimeWire). Many P2P barons have been foundational to the crypto movement: Jed McCaleb of eDonkey2000, Zooko Wilcox of Mojo Nation, and Bram Cohen of BitTorrent to name a few. Philosophically, they also share a common lineage—Lawrence Lessig, the [intellectual godfather of internet piracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Culture_(book)#Piracy), is also the originator of the phrase ["code is law."](http://codev2.cc/download+remix/Lessig-Codev2.pdf)

But there's more to this relationship. Let's dig deeper. I imagine most of you lived through the P2P file sharing revolution firsthand, but it's worth briefly rehashing the history.

## From Napster to BitTorrent
The P2P file sharing revolution began with Napster in 1999, launched by Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker. On its face, the application was straightforward: log in, search for a song you want, double click, and it's yours.

It sounds simple, but it's hard to describe how large of a paradigm shift Napster truly was.

![Napster interface](https://regmedia.co.uk/2011/10/06/napster.gif)

Remember what it was like to purchase music in 1999: standing in a CD aisle, surrounded by rows of by disc jackets, debating in your head which album to spend your $20 on. J-Lo? Smashmouth? Or maybe Jay-Z? To participate in pop culture, you must take sides. Every purchase is a careful tradeoff. Music is scarce and precious.

But Napster changed all that. It was as though the bank vault of music was propped open, free for plundering. Napster spread like a riot, clogging up bandwidth across college campuses. Young people couldn't get enough of it.

It wouldn't be long before Napster was thrust into news headlines thanks to legal challenges from Metallica and Dr. Dre. The [Streisand effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect) struck, and Napster seized the national conscience. At its peak in 2001, the service had more than [80M registered users](https://www.lifewire.com/history-of-napster-2438592).

Record labels knew their business models were directly threatened by file sharing. The RIAA mobilized and [filed numerous lawsuits against file sharing services beginning in 1997](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_group_efforts_against_file_sharing#Litigation), eventually culminating in a strategy of suing individual consumers. They hoped these tactics would create a chilling effect on file sharing, but record sales continued to decline after 1999. They didn't know it at the time, but this was the turning point after which the music-industrial complex would never recover.

Ultimately, the RIAA decided that Napster had to be made an example. After a lengthy court case, a judge ruled Napster liable for all of its users' copyright infringement, despite the fact that Napster's servers did not host any copyrighted content. This legal doctrine, known as [*vicarious infringement*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%26M_Records,_Inc._v._Napster,_Inc.#Vicarious_infringement), was the death knell of Napster and of any file sharing-based business model. Napster was driven to bankruptcy and forced to clamp down on all illegal file sharing. But Napster's defeat only spelled the beginning of this revolution.

You see, to the digital revolutionaries, the lesson of Napster was obvious. Despite all downloads being peer-to-peer, Napster operated a central server (primarily used for search indexing and peer discovery). This was its downfall. If the file sharing revolution were to continue, it would have to decentralize and become resilient to legal injunctions.

A traditional war had to evolve into guerrilla warfare.

Decentralized alternatives to Napster gradually arose, intentionally designed around this legal constraint. Successors like Gnutella (LimeWire) and eDonkey2000 (eMule) would have decentralized architectures that would be much more difficult to take down.

As the children of Napster proliferated, a philosophy began to solidify around internet piracy. Slogans materialized: "information wants to be free," "open culture," "sharing is caring." A new political party called [The Pirate Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Parties_International) was formed, championing online freedom and copyright reform, winning multiple political appointments across Europe. Radical innovations in intellectual property were explored such as [Creative Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons) and [copyleft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft) licensing. It seemed the revolution could not be stopped.

BitTorrent, founded by Bram Cohen in 2001, would arguably be the last stage in the evolution of P2P file sharing. The BitTorrent protocol overtook KaZaA, eMule, Limewire, SoulSeek, and all the other P2P networks. By 2012, BitTorrent peaked at a staggering [150M monthly active users](https://web.archive.org/web/20140326102305/http://www.bittorrent.com/intl/es/company/about/ces_2012_150m_users) (15% of the entire [Facebook userbase](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/feb/04/facebook-in-numbers-statistics) at that time). During its peak, BitTorrent was by far the [single largest source of internet traffic in the world](https://www.webcitation.org/6OVSh9hZ0?url=http://www.ipoque.com/sites/default/files/mediafiles/documents/internet-study-2008-2009.pdf).

Of course, BitTorrent was playing in a competitive field. Why did BitTorrent succeed where others fell into irrelevance?

## Freedom from rules
Simon Morris, a former executive at the BitTorrent company, wrote an excellent [four-part tour de force](https://medium.com/@simonhmorris/why-bittorrent-mattered-bittorrent-lessons-for-crypto-1-of-4-fa3c6fcef488) analyzing the parallels between BitTorrent and crypto (if you can't be bothered to read the whole thing, I encourage you to read its final chapter). I'll be building upon many of his insights here.

Simon Morris points out: BitTorrent was intentionally structured differently from other P2P file sharing projects.

The project's original home page begins its [explanation of BitTorrent](http://www.bittorrent.org/introduction.html) like this:

> BitTorrent is a free speech tool. BitTorrent gives you the same freedom to publish previously enjoyed by only a select few with special equipment and lots of money. ("Freedom of the press is limited to those who own one" — journalist A.J. Liebling.)

It is a strangely dry, intellectual manifesto.

Compare this to KaZaA's credo:
![KaZaA advertising](https://i.imgur.com/DGKe3SF.png)

Bram Cohen explicitly disavowed all illegal file sharing usage of BitTorrent. He never once acknowledged this as a legitimate use of the service. The core team and their messaging was unimpeachable. And this is precisely what allowed BitTorrent to flourish on the back of all of its legitimate usage: Linux distros, World of Warcraft updates, dataset sharing, and so on.

BitTorrent was never supposed to be a revolution in internet piracy; it was supposed to be a revolution in low-cost file distribution. This unobjectionable positioning made BitTorrent safely beyond the reach of the RIAA or any other aggrieved copyright holder.  

(The parallel with crypto is interesting: Vitalik and the Ethereum core team never endorsed the flood of ICOs—they [often denounced them](https://www.investopedia.com/news/ethereum-founder-cautions-ico-bubble-vitalek-buterin/). This is precisely what allowed Ethereum to flourish, despite being subverted by ICOs for speculative and extralegal purposes. This is why Ethereum was praised as a revolution in decentralized computing, "the world computer," while hosting the world's most brazen penny stock exchange.)

If you fast forward to today, the story of P2P file sharing *is* the story of BitTorrent. All other protocols have faded into obscurity. But BitTorrent is no longer used for downloading music in the western world.

Why not? I'll give you three reasons: Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora.

Newcomers in the music industry have adapted, and these services transformed the experience of discovering and listening to music. P2P file sharing once competed with the experience of driving to Walmart and buying a [$20 DRM-protected CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_BMG_copy_protection_rootkit_scandal) to listen to a single hit song. For consumers, the decision was comically easy: just pirate it.

Daniel Ek was the former CEO of uTorrent, a leading BitTorrent client. He understood this firsthand. After Napster collapsed and other decentralized file sharing networks popped up, Ek came up with the idea for a company he'd later name Spotify.

> I realised that you can never legislate away from piracy. Laws can definitely help, but it doesn't take away the problem. The only way to solve the problem was to create a service that was better than piracy and at the same time compensates the music industry – that gave us Spotify.

The industry was forced to evolve, and file sharing revolutionaries drove the change in more ways than one. Simon Harris captures this eloquently:

> Bittorrent... forced the media industry to think harder. In the light of the Bittorrent ecosystem, it simply wasn’t going to be possible to charge users to re-purchase all their music in MP3 format the same way they taxed users who wanted to transfer from vinyl to cassette to CD. In spite of ever more sophisticated copy protection technologies, ‘revenue protection’ service offerings and showcase trials and punishments, what actually happened as a result of this grand showdown between entrenched interests and technology wielded by the masses was not the victory of one side or the other, but the emergence of something totally different and radically better. In short, the whole concept of “the file” disappeared from sight and we watched the rebirth of old media in a new and better form (e.g. Spotify and Netflix) and the emergence of new media (e.g. YouTube and Instagram) all with experience-oriented value propositions and business models.

Consumers are more than willing to pay a small subscription fee for the convenience of modern streaming services. By comparison, tracking down malware-free Torrents for individual albums and then importing them into a music library now seems antiquated.

(Side note: most of the torrenting today is video, which makes sense. Video is splintered across many relatively high-cost subscription services: Netflix, HBO, Amazon, soon Disney. Many countries don't have licensing deals to have this content available on day 1, so torrenting is the only way to get simultaneous access with others across the Internet. And yet, content producers don't care as much as they did for music, for good reason: digital piracy serves as a kind of price discrimination. Wealthier consumers are willing to pay streaming services for on-demand, cross-device convenience. Poorer users self-select into online piracy—they likely wouldn't be paying consumers at the higher price point anyway, but will still evangelize the shows. We see the [same phenomenon](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/09/eu-study-finds-piracy-doesnt-hurt-game-sales-may-actually-help/) with gaming. That said, because of the bandwidth-intensiveness of video torrenting, BitTorrent still comprises some [20% of all online upstream traffic](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/d3q45v/bittorrent-usage-increases-netflix-streaming-sites), which skews significantly higher in the poorest parts of the world.)

Though today P2P file sharing [has significantly declined](https://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2017/06/01/the-long-slow-decline-of-bittorrent/), make no mistake: the digital piracy revolution moved industries. It forced music and film to cater to a digital-first world and eventually incentivized the invention of web streaming. The companies that didn't adapt are now footnotes in history. Those that did now get to build the media dynasties of the next decade.

## The lesson of P2P file sharing
P2P file sharing changed our relationship with media. So what's the story we should take away from this? Is it that young people successfully revolted against copyright and intellectual property laws? Should we take its intellectual champions, like the Swedish Pirate Party, at their word?

Of course not. The file sharing revolution was not fundamentally about ideology.

Few file sharing veterans are still committed to piracy today. Its fervor was a product of its circumstances. The real reason why the revolution happened was because of opposition to a rule that was in place—the rule was that music must be purchased and consumed via $20 store-bought CDs. You can't download it, you can't rip it, you can't share it—you can only consume music how the record industry says you can.

People hated this rule. So they broke it. And P2P protocols enabled this great, overwhelming mob of rule breakers to demonstrate the way they thought music ought to work.

![Boston Tea Party](https://www.massmoments.org/files/assets/moments/11-17-1738/11_17.1_1738.jpg)

Today, music works that way. No matter where you are, by doing a search and double clicking, you can listen to almost any song ever created.

Simon Morris claims this was the raison d'être of BitTorrent, and of decentralized networks more generally. Decentralization allows rules to be broken. And when a rule is opposed widely and strongly enough, people will build the technology to break that rule, and that technology will spread.

So why did ICOs need to be decentralized? Why couldn't the bubble have kicked off through equity-backed blockchain startups like in the dot com bubble? To Simon Morris, the answer is obvious—because ICOs were not just about the chance to invest in speculative blockchain projects. They were also about breaking rules: the rules around capital formation.

>Without this sort of rule-breaking (whether by accident or design) it’s quite hard to imagine why decentralized blockchain technology even matters. It’s a distributed data store with a complicated and slow update mechanism... The one value proposition that everyone seems to agree on for blockchain technologies is that they are ‘censor-proof’. And this matters only if you have something that someone wants to censor.

This begs the question: why do people want to break the rules around capital formation so badly?

The answer is complicated.

Consider the initial conditions of the ICO bubble. The bubble was primarily driven by countries in Asia with high savings rate and income inequality—China, Japan, and Korea. Over the last decade, we've seen income inequality rising, declines in wage growth for the global middle class, cost diseases elevating the costs of living, and a mass of overeducated young people with shrinking opportunities. The ICO bubble was a loud rattling of this cage.

The most massive wealth creation events in the world took place over the last decade—but it all went to other people. [You didn't get any](https://nypost.com/2019/01/29/most-americans-believe-the-economy-is-rigged-to-favor-the-rich-poll/). The new wave of startups that has subjugated your digital life and attention span: its fruits belong to the nerds in Silicon Valley, not you. As the New York Times put it: everyone is getting hilariously rich and you're not.

This leads people to wanting to break the rules. Why do only the elite of Silicon Valley, the Stanford programmers and MBAs get early access to all these world-changing companies—why not you?

The ICO bubble let young people convince themselves: hey, maybe I can predict the future too. I see this Bitcoin thing, I see this Ethereum thing, they're so revolutionary, why wouldn't the world change because of them?

And wouldn't they get just a little convinced that maybe for once they know more than their parents, more than the gatekeepers, more than Wall Street or Silicon Valley?

So they got in early, they ran everything up, they speculated and joined Subreddits and debated ideas and convinced themselves that their investments would "go to the moon." A new world was arriving, and they were going to be, for once, at the vanguard ushering it in.

The rules were not just broken, they were being replaced in real time.

And of course, when reality finally caught up, it showed them the consequences of breaking those rules. As 2018 brought everything crashing down, they saw the open floodgates of scams, frauds, and widespread market manipulation.

We must also acknowledge the other side of the market—entrepreneurs. In Silicon Valley raising venture money may be easier than it's ever been, but this is not so in the rest of the world. Most ICOs were dispersed around the world, and a similar story must have played out. Entrepreneurs asking themselves: technology is supposed to have leveled the playing field; in the age of the Internet, in the age of blockchain, what does it matter where I am or what university I went to?

ICOs promised a way forward. You didn't need to know someone at Sequoia to raise your ICO—you simply needed to build a better blockchain, and the world would beat a path to your door.

Remember all the stories of VCs quaking in their Patagonia vests, worried that they were being displaced?

Even among startups funded by Y Combinator, the hottest accelerator in the world, a startling number of them were pondering ICOs. They too disliked the rules around capital formation, the illiquidity of startup ownership. They wanted a way out, and speculators were all too pleased to provide them it.

It was only in retrospect that they would each learn why these rules were there in the first place. Once again, crypto was forced to relearn the lessons that traditional finance had long ago internalized.

# The revolution that cried wolf
Today, with the dust having settled and the ICO bubble now an awkward memory, we can reexamine its battle cries with more clarity. Did people really care about reforming the rules around capital formation? Did they really care about democratizing investing access? Did they really care about accredited investor laws, financial disclosures and AML/KYC requirements?

Many commentators [rallied](https://messari.substack.com/p/securities-law-and-crypto-unqualified) [against](https://vinnylingham.com/democratizing-crypto-investing-133f3108ecb6) [them](http://averagejoecrypto.com/crypto-accredited-investors-fix-rules/) during the run-up, but this too was probably just part of the energy of revolution. I don't see much clamoring for this in 2019.

And copyright law is, for all intents and purposes, mostly intact 20 years later.

So what does the file sharing revolution explain about the ICO bubble?

First, that you should not take ideology at its word. The underlying causes of revolutions are usually less philosophical than they appear. Second, it's likely that much of the ICO bubble was caused by the ripples of income inequality, technocratic uncertainty and malaise, waning social mobility, the deep and unsatisfied desire for social rhetoric to catch up with reality.

The world can always change faster than you think. But things also stay the same more than you think, if you wait long enough to get perspective.

But there's another side to what we saw in the ICO bubble—one which goes beyond the P2P file sharing revolution. For this, we turn to our second historical model: the penny stock boom of the 90s.

# II. Penny stocks

Balaji Srinivasan once claimed that tokens would turn blockchains into the [world's biggest stock market](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/05/balaji-srinivasan-21-co-interview-on-blockchain.html). This may someday be true—but for now, it seems that blockchains have become the world's biggest penny stock market instead.

![Wolf of Wall Street](https://i.imgur.com/3uYtZBj.jpg)

The term "penny stock" evokes images of shady stockbrokers in boiler rooms, and for good reason. You'll remember Jordan Belfort, the protagonist of the 2013 film Wolf of Wall Street, made his fortune hustling as a penny stock broker.

Penny stocks are defined differently in different countries, but in the US, a penny stock is a stock issued by a small company that trades below $5 a share (originally it was stocks that traded below $1, but you know, inflation and all). They are generally quoted [OTC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp) and seldom trade on national exchanges. They have low liquidity, little public information, and are not required to make significant financial disclosures.

As such, they are plagued with fraud.

## The history of penny stocks
The legal designation of penny stocks began after the 1929 stock market crash, which subsequently triggered the Great Depression. It was believed that the crash was partially caused by unbridled speculation on penny stocks, and this led to the [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seact1934.asp) designating formal restrictions on penny stock trading.

Throughout most of the 20th century, penny stock orders could only be placed via telephone. Offerings could not legally be placed in newspapers. The highest quality penny stocks would only provide financial reporting once a year, and the very worst penny stocks had no financial disclosures at all. Given all this, penny stocks didn't receive much attention.

But starting in the mid-90s with the growth of the Internet, penny stock trading exploded. Discount brokers emerged, offering automated interfaces and much lower trading fees. As retail investors flooded in, market manipulation became rampant. Eventually, federal regulators would step in, and a string of [high profile cases](https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/ts142000.htm) were brought against Mafia crime families that perpetrated penny stock manipulation schemes.

Penny stock trading has been brought back under stricter regulatory oversight, but it's still extremely speculative, and manipulation is common.

You might ask: why are people so drawn to penny stocks in the first place, given how fraught they are?

As a former professional poker player, I can tell you the answer is simple.

People love to gamble.

Throughout human history, gambling has been stigmatized, regulated, and outlawed, but like most aspects of human nature, it always survives one way or another. Humans will forever be drawn to the idea of turning around their fortunes, of outsmarting the establishment, of skipping steps on the ladder of society. For penny stocks, it hardly matters what the company does. They tap into the same greedy credulity behind all get rich quick schemes.

![Penny stocks banner](https://sykes-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/images/banner-tim.jpg)

But we must also acknowledge the other side of this market: the hustlers and fraudsters. To them, penny stocks are a gift. And they also don't care what the stocks represent—they simply need a company with a ticker and story to manipulate. Greed takes care of the rest.

Reminding you of anything?

## An embarrassment of riches
Here's a telling [article published in 2000](https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Internet-Makes-Stock-Scams-Easy-Pump-and-dump-2772185.php) on common Internet penny stock pump and dump schemes. Let's contrast it to ICOs.

> Before the Net, these promoters hired squads of telemarketers to push their stocks on unsuspecting investors. Now, it's as easy as blasting out e-mail, or if they're industrious, maintaining a Web site.

The modern version: hiring an [ICO marketing agency](https://hackernoon.com/the-top-21-icomarketing-agencies-pr-firms-ab3d41e279c9), which will manage your Telegram chat, Subreddit, Medium account, and BitcoinTalk thread.

Don't have a real community? No problem, buy a fake one.

![Buying Telegram group members](https://i.imgur.com/eUymVXC.png)

![Buying Twitter followers](https://i.imgur.com/KldmpFj.png)

> The current fashion is to announce the discovery of a new, inexpensive method of sending broadband signals over telephone lines at speeds far exceeding existing technologies... The promoters issue a constant stream of press releases chronicling development breakthroughs, marketing agreements and endorsements of the technology from qualified scientists.

How about a "hyper-scalable" "quantum-resistant protocol" for "supply chain management"? Getting some credentialed advisors to praise your protocol? Maybe rumored partnerships with a couple Fortune 50 companies?

> Optimistic posts then begin appearing on Internet stock message boards, such as those maintained by Yahoo and Raging Bull. Because few have heard of the new company, the promoters plant messages on other heavily frequented boards.

![BitcoinTalk pumping offer](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*3clYeCwJXzvgxi9ohxATgg.png)

![Pump and dump group](https://bitfalls.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/03-3.png)

(many of these examples are drawn from [Anatomy of a Pump & Dump Group](https://bitfalls.com/2018/01/12/anatomy-pump-dump-group/))

> If the promoters do a good job, and the market is strong, the stock price can soar from a few cents a share to $10, or in some cases, much more. Eventually, the share price collapses after the promoters sell out and quit pumping.

![OAX/ETH pump and dump](https://bitfalls.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/11.png)

You know the jig. Bounties, referral bonuses, airdrops, presales, advisor shares, purchased reviews, and so forth. By the time the ICO boom had gone mainstream, this procedure was a well-oiled machine.

Most of the long tail of ICOs—and that tail was very long—were complete nonsense. According to most trackers, the total number of ICOs was well into the thousands, and that's only counting those that were able to rise above the noise.

And like each penny stock boom before it, the ICO boom ended in [multiple regulatory actions](https://www.virtualcurrencyreport.com/category/b-enforcement-actions/) against the worst offenders. But regulators can't reach everyone, and most of the pump and dumpers either moved on or continue to manipulate coins at smaller scales.

In 1989, the heyday of penny stocks, a survey found that Americans had been cheated out of [at least $2B a year](http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-08/business/fi-1942_1_penny-stock) by fraudulent penny stock schemes. The ICO bubble was no different. The SATIS group estimated that [81% of ICOs were scams](https://www.investopedia.com/news/80-icos-are-scams-report/) and it's been widely reported that over [$9M was stolen per day in 2018](https://www.investopedia.com/news/beware-9m-are-lost-each-day-crypto-scams/) (annualized, that would be upwards of $3B a year). By sheer number, the overwhelming majority of ICOs can be explained this way.

## Who was the ICO boom for?
ICOs, just as penny stocks, are a two-sided market. Investors don't care about the technology, they just want objects of speculation to get rich on. Fraudsters don't care about the technology either, they just want objects of manipulation to get rich on. Everyone gets what they need, the market bustles with activity, and everyone makes money—until they don't.

Despite the technological accoutrements, it's an old story. So what do penny stocks explain about the ICO bubble? Penny stocks explain the shitcoins, the scams, the unregistered securities, the market manipulation, and most of the long tail of the ICO bubble.

(You might push back here that it was really the name brand cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether that captured most of the value, not the long tail of ICOs. While it's true that Bitcoin appreciated significantly during the bubble, that was driven largely by being the reserve currency of ICOs and the exchanges where speculation took place. It was also ICOs that ultimately drove the bubble's collapse, evidenced by [Bitcoin's dominance ratio](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage) falling from 85% before the boom to a low of 33% in January 2018, and then back to 50% post-crash.)

# THIS PARA BELOW NEEDS TO BE REWORKED

The P2P file sharing boom helps explain crypto's subversive rejection of power structures and its revolutionary animus. As for being a form of gambling and vector for fraud, penny stocks also explain much of the characteristics of ICOs. But there's an element that we're missing here, one that I've failed to address so far—the actual substance of technological innovation. After all, I don't believe for a second that everything in the ICO bubble was cynically stupid or a failure of creative power. To understand this, we must turn to the dot com bubble and its principal soothsayer, Carlota Perez.

# III. Technological Bubbles

> All bubbles are about greed… but some bubbles are also about the installation of technological revolutions. *– Carlota Perez*

Carlota Perez is the patron saint of venture capitalists. Her seminal work, [*Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital*](https://www.amazon.com/Technological-Revolutions-Financial-Capital-Dynamics/dp/1843763311) has been been cited by [Marc Andreessen](http://fortune.com/2014/02/13/marc-andreessen-tech-is-recovering-from-a-depression/) and [Fred Wilson](https://avc.com/2015/02/the-carlota-perez-framework/) as central to their understanding of the tech industry.

I won’t do her book justice here, but I’ll attempt to summarize the key ideas that are relevant to crypto. I’ll be quoting heavily from Carlota herself—as you read, if you're anything like me, you'll cringe at the parallels.

## Innovation moves in cycles
Carlota Perez subscribes to the long wave economic cycle theory, known as [Kondratiev Waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kondratiev_wave), in which technological innovation occurs in 45-60 year waves.

According to Perez, these innovation waves consist of three phases:

1. Installation
2. Collapse
3. Deployment

Installation is the period when a new technology is first explored, installed, and then speculated on. This speculation leads to an unsustainable asset bubble and a spectacular collapse. Then a more sober period of deployment takes place, during which the technology matures and sustainably alters many aspects of society. After a full deployment cycle has exhausted its economic growth, a new technology precipitates a new innovation wave, and the cycle begins anew.

> There have been five technological revolutions in 240 years... Each of these revolutions drives a great surge of development and shapes growth for half a century or more.


Each of these revolutions was kicked off by a seminal event that would catalyze the technology—the industrial revolution with Arkwright's Cromford mill, the steam and railway age with the Liverpool-Manchester Railway, the steel and heavy engineering age with Carnegie's Bessemer steel plant, the age of automobiles with Ford's assembly line, and the computer age with Intel's 4004 microprocessor.

By this model, the moment that kicked off ICO bubble must be the launch of Ethereum. Ethereum was not the first cryptocurrency, but it was the first ICO to produce astronomical returns, and it would set the foundation for the frenzy that was to come. Ethereum launched in 2015, exactly 44 years after the Intel 4004 in 1971. If K-waves are meant to be 45-60 years apart, then a crypto revolution plausibly fits neatly into her framework.

> Why call them revolutions, though? Because they go far beyond the powerful set of new industries; they also transform the whole economy by providing a new techno-economic paradigm.

What does she mean by "techno-economic paradigm"?

Simply put, a techno-economic paradigm is a new accepted way of doing things. When a new technology takes form and begins driving innovation, it brings with it a new logic of how businesses should be structured. For example, with the advent of the automobile, the paradigm encouraged businesses to adopt mass production, economies of scale, and standardized products for mass marketing appeal—the logic of the factory. In this paradigm, every American should own not just a mass-produced automobile, but also a TV, a refrigerator, a washing machine, etc.

> The emerging heuristic routines and approaches are gradually internalized by engineers and managers, investors and bankers, sales and advertising people, entrepreneurs and consumers. In time, a shared logic is established; a new "common sense" is accepted for investment decisions as well as for consumer choice. The old ideas are unlearned and the new ones become "normal."

As a techno-economic paradigm becomes ascendant, any entrepreneur who does not subscribe to the new paradigm will be seen as low-status and behind the times.

![Techno-economic paradigm](https://i.imgur.com/ywCcYxa.png)

We know the techno-economic paradigm of the internet revolution—move fast and break things, launch MVPs, iterate in short cycles, pursue business models with zero marginal cost. Basically all the mantras consumed by aspiring tech founders.

Cast in these terms, the techno-economic paradigm of crypto is almost embarrassing to say out loud. Here’s what we taught founders about how to build a business in the crypto age:

1. Shoehorn your idea into a protocol
2. Invent a story how it will eventually be decentralized
3. Write an academic-looking whitepaper with some math in it
4. Create a Swiss foundation
5. Open source your code
6. Recruit advisors and put them on your website
7. Do a public ICO

You know the jig. Basically, cargo culting the Ethereum ICO.

Founders who deviated from this paradigm were seen as low-status, opportunistic, "not getting it," and were thus less rewarded in their fundraises. Yet in hindsight, almost none of this was predictive of an entrepreneur’s success.

## The installation phase
If we have just witnessed the *collapse* phase, then it’s worth rewinding to what Perez has to say about the period that precedes it: the installation phase.

> During Installation, investment is led by financial capital, which funds the technological transformation, and, in the excitement, also intensifies its casino-type activities.

Financial capital is what Perez calls short-term, return seeking capital. This is as opposed to *production capital*, which is engaged in long-term and sustainable company-building. Production capital characterizes the deployment phase, whereas financial capital dominates the installation and collapse phases.

Eventually all of this rises to a fever pitch in what Perez dubs "Frenzy."

> Frenzy is the tumultuous period when financial capital takes off on its own... All those benefitting from this flourishing of opportunities believe the world is going through a marvelous time.

New millionaires are minted. They try to multiply their wealth in the same way they made it, redeploying their capital to generate more profits. The gap between paper values and real values widens, and the newly rich come to believe that their newfound wealth is due to superior insight and intuition.

> Financial capital... breaks loose, backs the new entrepreneurs, dismantles as much as it can of the institutional framework, overinvests in the new infrastructure, and also uses the new technologies to innovate in instruments for financial speculation.

Dismantles institutional frameworks, check. Overinvests in new infrastructure, check. Invents new instruments for financial speculation (ICOs, SAFTs, SAFTEs), check.

> As the various assets go up in price, confidence grows that they will continue to do so... Since the profits to be had are amazing, everybody—including widows and orphans—eventually become aware of the incredible possibilities. They gradually dare to enter what used to be alien territory, trying to get a piece of the action.

Do you remember being told by barbers, Uber drivers, personal trainers that you should invest in IOTA? Do you remember the NYT article, [Everyone is Getting Hilariously Rich and You're Not](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/13/style/bitcoin-millionaires.html)?

Perez recalls a quote by Bruce Nussbaum about the dotcom bubble:

> "So investors accepted sky-high P/Es, puffed-up bottom lines, and some strange business plans—because who really knew what was possible? It was a time of opportunity, a time to place bets. And they paid off..."

Do you remember the nonsensical projects? The teams that no one had heard of? The copy and pasted whitepapers? All the shameless rhetoric about 10 trillion dollar TAMs and 100K transactions per second?


> The financiers (and the investors who trust their money to them) seem to be convinced that they have discovered the most profitable vein. They then indulge in the intense repetition of the same successful recipe, be it from canals from any river to any river, as in the first revolution, or more dot coms and telecommunications.

Do you remember all the ICO investing syndicates? The Telegram groups? The newsletters?

During Canal Mania in the 1790s, canals were created from river to river with no regard for routing, believing that canals magically produced demand. In the 1840s, railway projects were built from town to town without regard for engineering practicality. In the 1920s, real estate values became untethered from the constraints of urban planning, believing that the automobile meant any territory could be valuable if connected by roads. And of course, in the 90s, dotcoms were funded with no evidence of product-market fit.

None of this is new.

And of course, do you remember all the voices ([rejoicing](https://medium.com/dash-for-newbies/crypto-the-dawn-of-the-single-greatest-wealth-transfer-in-the-history-of-mankind-bc7683ad4c), [lamenting](https://twitter.com/RyanSAdams/status/1052566485200199681)) the new redistribution of wealth?

> The whole frenzy phenomenon is, at bottom, a huge process of income redistribution in favor of those directly or indirectly involved in the casino, which funds the massive process of creative destruction in the economy. That regressive distribution generates a double vicious cycle: one is economic, expressed in the market; the other is social, expressed in political terms. Both get worse as the bubble increases.

Of course, we cannot talk about the ICO bubble without talking about its dark side: the fraudsters, the pump and dumpers, the exit scammers.

> That permissive atmosphere generates an opacity that is highly convenient for corruption and for the flourishing of outright illegal activities... This is then a time for swindlers.

The ICO bubble was simply a variation on the theme. The players and the tactics were different, but the human stories were the same. There were, as always, stories of overnight millionaires, flagrant scams, manifestos declaring a new technological order, levered debts and second mortgages that ended in catastrophe—all the usual roil and ruin of speculative manias.

All this is to say, we've seen this before.

## The aftermath
Crypto's gilded age is probably now over. Most of those newly minted millionaires have unwittingly surrendered their riches, the hype has died away, ICO funding has dried up, [SEC enforcement actions](http://fortune.com/2018/11/02/sec-ico-report-cryptocurrency-scams/) are trickling in, and the media's crush on crypto has passed.

But, Perez reminds us, the installation phase and subsequent crash is not merely painful—it is necessary to any technological revolution. The financial casino attracts the funds necessary to install basic infrastructure and facilitate social learning. Without the dotcom bubble, there would not have been all of the investments into optical fiber buildouts, new ISPs and internet infrastructure, packet-switched networks for telecoms, and all of the other social and technological infrastructure necessary for the Internet to take over the world.

For crypto, there are now many world class teams well-capitalized to build, scale, and evolve blockchain technology, and tens of millions of people in the world who now understand decentralization, proof of work, and private keys. Looking back, it's really quite amazing! It comes at a high cost, but Perez hints: it's likely that bubbles like these are the only way to overcome technological inertia.

Ultimately, the collapse paves the way for the more fruitful and unglamorous deployment phase. For crypto, we'll see whether that's borne out.

Perez's book was written in 2003 during the nadir of the dotcom crash, and she presciently situates the Internet within her K-wave framework. History has proven her right. But we should be careful not to invert her thesis: she claims that all technological revolutions induce a bubble, but that does not mean all bubbles are induced by technological revolutions—indeed, most aren't.

So what does Perez explain about the ICO bubble?

She explains the logic of frenzy, the stoking of financial capital, and the rhetoric of revolution ("the future will be decentralized"). She explains the explosion of retail investors ("widows and orphans"), traditional financial capital piling in at dizzying prices (Telegram, Filecoin, Hashgraph), and the flood of traditional entrepreneurs contorting themselves to follow the new paradigm. All of the VC coins and status games obey the time-old logic of installation.

But there's another side to what we saw in the ICO bubble, which goes beyond Perez's framework. For this, we turn to our second historical model: the penny stock boom of the 90s.







CONCLUSION: bring down the volume a bit.

(Though it’s a drop in the bucket compared to all stages of venture capital, which deployed around $500B during that period.)

But this bubble was not nearly as destabilizing—the dotcom bubble wiped out $5 trillion of value, and was more localized to the United States, whereas losses in the ICO bubble were absorbed across many more economies.
