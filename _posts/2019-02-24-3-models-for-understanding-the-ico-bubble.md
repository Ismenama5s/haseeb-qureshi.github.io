We can safely say the ICO bubble is over now.

The ICO bubble was the event that singularly put crypto on the world stage. I won’t bore you with recounting the details—you were there, you saw it, and if you’re reading this, you probably took part in it.

There’s already been enough hand-wringing and I-knew-it-all-alongs. What I want to do in this essay is answer a different question—one that, in truth, it’s too early to really answer.

**Why did the ICO bubble happen?**

It’s important here to get a sense of scale. $6B was raised through ICOs in 2017 and $8B in 2018 (those numbers are fuzzy, depending on what you count as “raised”). By comparison, the [seed and angel-stage dollars](https://news.crunchbase.com/news/q4-2018-closes-out-a-record-year-for-the-global-vc-market/) invested in 2017 was about $10B, and in 2018 around $15B. Though it’s a drop in the bucket compared to all stages of venture capital, which deployed $183B in 2017 and $293B in 2018.

When the ICO bubble finally popped in 2018, the “market cap” of all crypto fell from a high of $834B to $126B, wiping out $708B in paper value, an 85% drop from its peak in January. This makes it worse than the dotcom bubble’s 78% collapse. But this bubble was not nearly as destabilizing—the dotcom bubble wiped out $5 trillion of value, and was more localized to the United States, whereas losses in the ICO bubble were absorbed across many more economies. (And, of course, comparing “market capitalization” in crypto to the NASDAQ is [problematic](https://medium.com/@RainDogDance/bitcoin-as-a-novel-market-institution-nic-carter-talk-at-baltic-honeybadger-2018-e085f163b213").)

So how can we make sense of what happened? There are, I believe, 3 major historical models that explain the ICO bubble. The first and most obvious is the dotcom bubble. The second is the boom in penny stocks in the 90s. And the third is the advent of P2P filesharing in the late 2000s. I’ll examine each in turn, and demonstrate how different aspects of what happened in the ICO bubble call back to events in each of these historical precedents.

History does not repeat—but there are a few refrains it loves to come back to.

# I. Technological Bubbles

> All bubbles are about greed… but some bubbles are also about the installation of technological revolutions. *– Carlota Perez*

Carlota Perez is the patron saint of venture capitalists. Her seminal work, *Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital* has been been cited by [Marc Andreessen](http://fortune.com/2014/02/13/marc-andreessen-tech-is-recovering-from-a-depression/) and [Fred Wilson](https://avc.com/2015/02/the-carlota-perez-framework/) as key to their understanding of the tech industry’s evolution.

I won’t do her book justice here, but I’ll attempt to summarize the key ideas in the book that are relevant to the ICO bubble. I’ll be quoting heavily from Carlota herself—as you read, you’ll probably cringe at the parallels with crypto.

## Innovation moves in cycles
Carlota Perez subscribes to the long business cycle theory, also known as [Kondratiev Waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kondratiev_wave), in which technological innovation takes place in waves that arrive every 45-60 years.

According to Perez, these innovation waves consist of three phases: installation, collapse, and deployment. Installation is the period when a new technology is first explored, installed, and then speculated on. This speculation leads to an unsustainable asset bubble which inevitably collapses. Then, post collapse, a more sober period of deployment takes place during which the technology matures and alters many aspects of society. Once a full deployment has exhausted its potential for driving the economy, a new innovation wave must follow and the cycle begins again.

The Ethereum blockchain launched in 2015, exactly 44 years after Intel announced its first microprocessor, the Intel 4004, in 1971. If K-waves are meant to be 45-60 years apart, then crypto plausibly fits neatly into her framework.

Let’s keep going.

> There have been five technological revolutions in 240 years… Why call them revolutions, though? Because they go far beyond the powerful set of new industries; they also transform the whole economy by providing a new techno-economic paradigm.

What does she mean by techno-economic paradigm? Simply put, a techno-economic paradigm is a new accepted way of doing things. When a new technology takes form and begins driving innovation, it brings with it a new logic of how businesses should be structured. For example, with the advent of the automobile, the logic of the technology meant that businesses should lean into mass production, achieve economies of scale, and standardize their products for mass marketing appeal (the logic of the factory). This led to not only to the vision of every American owning a mass-produced automobile, but also a TV, a refrigerator, washing machine, etc.

> The emerging heuristic routines and approaches are gradually internalized by engineers and managers, investors and bankers, sales and advertising people, entrepreneurs and consumers. In time, a shared logic is established; a new “common sense” is accepted for investment decisions as well as for consumer choice. The old ideas are unlearned and the new ones become “normal”.

As a techno-economic paradigm becomes ascendant, any entrepreneur who does not subscribe to the new techno-economic paradigm will be seen as low-status and behind the times.

We know the techno-economic paradigm of the computer revolution—move fast and break things, launch MVPs, iterate in short cycles, pursue business models with zero marginal cost, emphasize design and simplicity. Basically all the mantras consumed by aspiring founders.

Cast in these terms, the techno-economic paradigm of crypto is almost embarrassing to say out loud. Here’s what we taught founders how to build a business in the crypto age: you should morph your idea into a protocol, eventually decentralize it, write an academic-looking whitepaper with some math in it, create a Swiss foundation, do a public ICO, open source your code, invent some story about how to go cross-chain or be quantum-resistant… you know the jig.

In hindsight, we can acknowledge how almost none of this was predictive of an entrepreneur’s success. But founders who did not do this during the ICO boom were seen as retrogressive and low-status, and thus were not rewarded in the market.

## The installation phase
If we have just witnessed the collapse phase, then it’s worth rewinding to what Perez has to say about the installation phase.

> During Installation, investment is led by financial capital, which funds the technological transformation, and, in the excitement, also intensifies its casino-type activities until it decouples from the real economy building a major asset inflation boom that ends in catastrophic collapse.”

Her book was written in 2003 during the nadir of the dotcom bubble, from which she draws many of her examples. She presciently points out that the dotcom bubble has all the bearings of the past 5 major technological revolutions since the industrial revolution, each of which was characterized by a similar asset bubble. She situates the dotcom bubble cleanly within this framework, and presciently predicted that this too would pass and usher in the information technology-driven economy that we live in today.
