We can safely say the ICO bubble is over now.

The ICO bubble was the event that singularly put crypto on the world stage. I won’t bore you with recounting the details—you were there, you saw it, and if you’re reading this, you probably took part in it.

There’s already been enough hand-wringing and I-knew-it-all-alongs. What I want to do in this essay is answer a different question—one that, in truth, it’s too early to really answer.

**Why did the ICO bubble happen?**

![World among worlds](https://i.imgur.com/qFvYiQN.png)

It’s important here to get a sense of scale. $6B was raised through ICOs in 2017 and $8B in 2018 (those numbers are fuzzy, depending on what you count as “raised”). By comparison, the [seed and angel-stage dollars](https://news.crunchbase.com/news/q4-2018-closes-out-a-record-year-for-the-global-vc-market/) invested in 2017 was about $10B, and in 2018 around $15B. Though it’s a drop in the bucket compared to all stages of venture capital, which deployed around $500B during that period.

![ICO collapse](https://i.imgur.com/66rgZCT.png)

When the ICO bubble finally popped in 2018, the “market cap” of all crypto fell $700B in paper value, an 85% drop from its peak in January. This makes it worse than the dotcom bubble’s 78% collapse. But this bubble was not nearly as destabilizing—the dotcom bubble wiped out $5 trillion of value, and was more localized to the United States, whereas losses in the ICO bubble were absorbed across many more economies. (And, of course, comparing “market capitalization” in crypto to the NASDAQ is [problematic](https://medium.com/@RainDogDance/bitcoin-as-a-novel-market-institution-nic-carter-talk-at-baltic-honeybadger-2018-e085f163b213").)

# TALK ABOUT HOW THIS SEEMS UNPRECEDENTED, RIGHT? OF COURSE, NOT AT ALL.

So how can we make sense of what happened? There are, I believe, 3 major historical models that explain the ICO bubble. The first and most obvious is the dotcom bubble. The second is the boom in penny stocks in the 90s. And the third is the advent of P2P filesharing in the late 2000s. I’ll examine each in turn, and demonstrate how different aspects of what happened in the ICO bubble call back to events in each of these historical precedents.

History does not repeat—but there are a few refrains it loves to come back to.

# I. Technological Bubbles

> All bubbles are about greed… but some bubbles are also about the installation of technological revolutions. *– Carlota Perez*

Carlota Perez is the patron saint of venture capitalists. Her seminal work, *Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital* has been been cited by [Marc Andreessen](http://fortune.com/2014/02/13/marc-andreessen-tech-is-recovering-from-a-depression/) and [Fred Wilson](https://avc.com/2015/02/the-carlota-perez-framework/) as key to understanding the tech industry.

I won’t do her book justice here, but I’ll attempt to summarize the key ideas in the book that are relevant to crypto. I’ll be quoting heavily from Carlota herself—as you read, you’ll probably cringe at the parallels.

## Innovation moves in cycles
Carlota Perez subscribes to the long wave economic cycle theory, known as [Kondratiev Waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kondratiev_wave), in which technological innovation occurs in 45-60 year waves.

According to Perez, these innovation waves consist of three phases:

1. Installation
2. Collapse
3. Deployment

Installation is the period when a new technology is first explored, installed, and then speculated on. This speculation leads to an unsustainable asset bubble and a spectacular collapse. Then a more sober period of deployment takes place during which the technology matures and sustainably alters many aspects of society. After a full deployment has exhausted its potential for driving economic growth, a new innovation wave must follow and the cycle begins anew.

> There have been five technological revolutions in 240 years... Each of these revolutions drives a great surge of development and shapes growth for half a century or more.

![Carlota Perez](https://i.imgur.com/Ss36xmF.png)

Each of these revolutions was kicked off by a seminal event that would catalyze the wave—the industrial revolution with Arkwright's Cromford mill, the steam and railway age with the Liverpool-Manchester Railway, the steel and heavy engineering age with Carnegie's Bessemer steel plant, the age of automobiles with Ford's assembly line, and the computer age with Intel's 4004 microprocessor.

![K-waves summary](https://i.imgur.com/DuGafL5.png)

I would argue that the moment that kicked off the ICO bubble was the launch of Ethereum. Though it was not the first cryptocurrency, it was the first major ICO to produce astronomical returns, and it would set the rules for the frenzy that was to come.

The Ethereum blockchain launched in 2015, exactly 44 years after 1971. If K-waves are meant to be 45-60 years apart, then crypto plausibly fits neatly into her framework.

> Why call them revolutions, though? Because they go far beyond the powerful set of new industries; they also transform the whole economy by providing a new techno-economic paradigm.

What does she mean by techno-economic paradigm? Simply put, a techno-economic paradigm is a new accepted way of doing things. When a new technology takes form and begins driving innovation, it brings with it a new logic of how businesses should be structured. For example, with the advent of the automobile, the logic of the technology meant that businesses should adopt mass production, achieve economies of scale, and standardize their products for mass marketing appeal—the logic of the factory. In this paradigm, every American should own not only a mass-produced automobile, but also a TV, a refrigerator, a washing machine, etc.

> The emerging heuristic routines and approaches are gradually internalized by engineers and managers, investors and bankers, sales and advertising people, entrepreneurs and consumers. In time, a shared logic is established; a new “common sense” is accepted for investment decisions as well as for consumer choice. The old ideas are unlearned and the new ones become “normal”.

As a techno-economic paradigm becomes ascendant, any entrepreneur who does not subscribe to the new paradigm will be seen as low-status and behind the times.

![Techno-economic paradigm](https://i.imgur.com/ywCcYxa.png)

We know the techno-economic paradigm of the computer revolution—move fast and break things, launch MVPs, iterate in short cycles, pursue business models with zero marginal cost. Basically all the mantras consumed by aspiring tech founders.

Cast in these terms, the techno-economic paradigm of crypto is almost embarrassing to say out loud. Here’s what we taught founders how to build a business in the crypto age: you should shoehorn your idea into a protocol, invent a story how it will eventually be decentralized, write an academic-looking whitepaper with some math in it, create a Swiss foundation, do a public ICO, open source your code… you know the jig. Basically, cargo culting the Ethereum ICO.

In hindsight, we can acknowledge how almost none of this was predictive of an entrepreneur’s success. But founders who did not adopt this paradigm during the ICO boom were seen as low-status, and thus were less rewarded in their fundraising.

## The installation phase
If we have just witnessed the collapse phase, then it’s worth rewinding to what Perez has to say about the installation phase.

> During Installation, investment is led by financial capital, which funds the technological transformation, and, in the excitement, also intensifies its casino-type activities.

Financial capital is what Perez deems short-term return-seeking capital (as opposed to *production capital*, which is more long-term and sustainable, and characterizes the deployment phase).

> Financial capital then breaks loose, backs the new entrepreneurs, dismantles as much as it can of the institutional framework, overinvests in the new infrastructure, and also uses the new technologies to innovate in instruments for financial speculation.

This is a little too on the nose for crypto.

Dismantles institutional frameworks, check. Overinvests in new infrastructure, check. Invents new instruments for financial speculation (ICOs, SAFTs, SAFTEs), check.

## The Frenzy
Eventually all of this rises to a fever pitch in what Perez dubs "Frenzy."

> Frenzy is the tumultuous period when financial capital takes off on its own... All those benefitting from this flourishing of opportunities believe the world is going through a marvelous time.

New millionaires are minted. They want to multiply their wealth in the same way they made it, redeploying their capital with high pressure to generate more profits. They come to believe that it's their own superior insights and intuition that led to this tremendous growth. The gap between paper values and real values widen, which accelerates the diffusion of the paradigm.

(Ringing a bell?)

> As the various assets go up in price, confidence grows that they will continue to do so... Since the profits to be had are amazing, everybody—including widows and orphans—eventually becomes aware of the incredible possibilities. They gradually dare to enter what used to be alien territory, trying to get a piece of the action.

Do you remember the article [Everyone is Getting Hilariously Rich and You're Not](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/13/style/bitcoin-millionaires.html) in the NYT?

She quotes Bruce Nussbaum, writing in Business Week about the late 90s:

> "So investors accepted sky-high P/Es, puffed-up bottom lines, and some strange business plans—because who really knew what was possible? It was a time of opportunity, a time to place bets. And they paid off..."

Do you remember the nonsensical projects? The teams that no one had heard of? The copy and pasted whitepapers? All the shameless rhetoric about 1 trillion dollar TAMs and 100K transactions per second?

> ... The financiers (and the investors who trust their money to them) seem to be convinced that they have discovered the most profitable vein. They then indulge in the intense repetition of the same successful recipe, be it from canals from any river to any river, as in the first revolution, or more dot coms and telecommunications.

Do you remember all the ICO investing syndicates? The Telegram groups? The newsletters?

During Canal Mania in the 1790s, canals were created from river to river with no regard for routing, believing that canals would magically produce demand. In the 1840s, railway projects were began from place to place without regard for engineering practicality, and subsequently failed. In the 1920s, real estate values were unmoored from the constraints of urban planning because the automobile implied that any territory could be valuable if connected by roads. And of course, in the 90s, dot coms were created with no evidence of demand for their products.

None of this is new.

And of course, do you remember all the voices (some [rejoicing](https://medium.com/dash-for-newbies/crypto-the-dawn-of-the-single-greatest-wealth-transfer-in-the-history-of-mankind-bc7683ad4c), some [lamenting](https://twitter.com/RyanSAdams/status/1052566485200199681)) the new redistribution of wealth?

> The whole frenzy phenomenon is, at bottom, a huge process of income redistribution in favor of those directly or indirectly involved in the casino, which funds the massive process of creative destruction in the economy. That regressive distribution generates a double vicious cycle: one is economic, expressed in the market; the other is social, expressed in political terms. Both get worse as the bubble increases.

Of course, we cannot talk about the ICO bubble without talking about its dark side: the fraudsters, the pump and dumpers, the exit scammers.

> That permissive atmosphere generates an opacity that is highly convenient for corruption and for the flourishing of outright illegal activities... This is then a time for swindlers.

So the ICO bubble was but a variation on the theme. The players and the colors were different, but the social dynamics and human stories were the same. There were, as always, stories of overnight millionaires, flagrant scams, second and third mortgages that ended in catastrophe, all the usual human roil and ruin.

All this is to say, we've seen this before.

![Installation phase](https://i.imgur.com/7bBzPss.png)

## The aftermath
Crypto's gilded age is probably now over. Most of those newly minted millionaires have unwittingly surrendered their riches, the hype has died away, ICO funding has dried up, [SEC enforcement actions](http://fortune.com/2018/11/02/sec-ico-report-cryptocurrency-scams/) are trickling in, and the media's crush on crypto has passed.

But, Perez reminds us, the installation phase and subsequent crash is not merely painful—it is necessary to any technological revolution. The financial casino attracts the funds necessary to install basic infrastructure and facilitate social learning. Without the dotcom bubble, there would not have been all of the investments into optical fiber buildouts, new ISPs and internet infrastructure, packet-switched networks for telecoms, and all of the other social and technological infrastructure that set the stage for Internet adoption.

For crypto, there are now many world class teams well-capitalized to build, scale, and evolve blockchain technology, and tens of millions of people in the world who now understand decentralization, proof of work, and private keys. It comes at a high cost, but Perez suggests that bubbles like these are necessary to overcome technological inertia.

Ultimately, the collapse paves the way for the full unfolding of the more fruitful deployment phase.

Perez's book was written in 2003 during the nadir of the dotcom crash, from which she draws many of her examples. She is prescient in situationg the crash neatly within her K-wave framework. History has proven her exactly right—Amazon went public in 1997 at $18 a share, climbed to $300 in 1999, until it collapsed back down to $6 a share after the crash. It now trades at upwards of $1,600 a share.

Of course, we should be careful not to invert Perez's thesis: all technological revolutions create a bubble, but that does not mean all bubbles are created by a technological revolution (indeed, most aren't).

So what does Perez predict here? She predicts the logic of frenzy, the stoking of financial capital, and the rhetoric of revolution ("the future will be decentralized"). She explains the explosion of retail investors ("widows and orphans"), traditional capital piling in at dizzying prices (Telegram, Filecoin, Hashgraph), and the flood of traditional entrepreneurs contorting themselves to follow the new paradigm.

But there's another side to what we saw in the ICO bubble, which goes beyond Perez's framework. For this, we turn to our second historical model: the penny stock boom.

# II. Penny stocks

Balaji Srinivasan once claimed that tokens would turn blockchains into the world's biggest stock market. This may someday be true—but for now, tokens have become the world's biggest *penny stock* market.

The term "penny stock" evokes shady stockbrokers in boiler rooms, and for good reason. Jordan Belfort, the protagonist the 2013 film Wolf of Wall Street, made his fortune hustling as a penny stock broker.

![Wolf of Wall Street](https://i.imgur.com/3uYtZBj.jpg)

Penny stocks are defined differently in different countries and go by different names. But in the US, a penny stock is a stock issued by a small company that trades below $5 a share (originally it was stocks that traded below $1, but you know, inflation and all). They are generally quoted [OTC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp) and seldom trade on national exchanges. They have low liquidity, little public information, and do not require significant financial disclosures. As such, they tend to be easily manipulated and are plagued with fraud.

## The history of penny stocks
The legal designation of penny stocks began after the 1929 stock market crash that triggered the Great Depression. It was believed that unbridled speculation on penny stocks was one of the principal causes of the crash, which led to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 designating formal restrictions on penny stock trading.

![Night singer of shares](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Bubble.folly.jpg)

Throughout most of the 20th century, penny stock orders could only be placed via the phone. Offerings could not be legally placed in newspapers, and were mostly traded OTC. The highest quality penny stocks would provide only annual financial reporting—the very worst had none at all.

But starting in the mid-90s with the growth of the Internet, penny stock trading exploded. Penny stock discount brokers emerged, able to offer an automated interface and much lower trading fees. As retail investors flooded in, market manipulation became rampant. Eventually, federal regulators would step in, and a string of [high profile cases](https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/ts142000.htm) were brought against Mafia crime families that were involved in widespread penny stock manipulation schemes.

Penny stock trading has been brought back under control, but it's still extremely speculative, with rampant manipulation and little regulatory oversight.

It's worth taking a breath here. Why are people so drawn to penny stocks in the first place, given how fraught they are?

As a former professional poker player, I can tell you the answer is simple: people love gambling. They always have and always will. Throughout history gambling has been stigmatized, regulated, and outlawed, but it always survives one way or another. People love the idea of turning around their fortunes, the rush of outsmarting the establishment. It hardly matters what the company does. Penny stocks prey on the same greedy credulity behind all get rich quick schemes.

![Penny stocks banner](https://sykes-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/images/banner-tim.jpg)

On the other side of the market, penny stocks are a gift to hustlers and scammers. For those manipulating markets, they don't care what about the stocks represent—they simply need a company, a ticker, and a story. Greed will take care of the rest.

## An embarrassment of riches
Here's a telling [article published in 2000](https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Internet-Makes-Stock-Scams-Easy-Pump-and-dump-2772185.php) on common Internet pump and dump schemes. Let's contrast it to ICOs.

> Before the Net, these promoters hired squads of telemarketers to push their stocks on unsuspecting investors. Now, it's as easy as blasting out e-mail, or if they're industrious, maintaining a Web site.

Now it's as easy as hiring an [ICO marketing agency](https://hackernoon.com/the-top-21-icomarketing-agencies-pr-firms-ab3d41e279c9), which will manage your Telegram chat, Subreddit, Medium account, and BitcoinTalk thread.

Don't have a real community? No problem, buy a fake one.

![Buying Telegram group members](https://i.imgur.com/eUymVXC.png)

![Buying Twitter followers](https://i.imgur.com/KldmpFj.png)

> The current fashion is to announce the discovery of a new, inexpensive method of sending broadband signals over telephone lines at speeds far exceeding existing technologies.

How about an IOT, quantum-resistant DAG protocol for supply chain management?

> The promoters issue a constant stream of press releases chronicling development breakthroughs, marketing agreements and endorsements of the technology from qualified scientists.

Oh... it hurts.

> Optimistic posts then begin appearing on Internet stock message boards, such as those maintained by Yahoo and Raging Bull. Because few have heard of the new company, the promoters plant messages on other heavily frequented boards.

![BitcoinTalk pumping offer](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*3clYeCwJXzvgxi9ohxATgg.png)

![Pump and dump group](https://bitfalls.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/03-3.png)

![Pumping chat](https://bitfalls.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08-2.png)

(many of these are drawn from [The Anatomy of a Pump & Dump Group](https://bitfalls.com/2018/01/12/anatomy-pump-dump-group/), a great little exposé)

> If the promoters do a good job, and the market is strong, the stock price can soar from a few cents a share to $10, or in some cases, much more. Eventually, the share price collapses after the promoters sell out and quit pumping.

![OAX/ETH pump and dump](https://bitfalls.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/11.png)

You know the jig. Airdrops, bounties, referral bonuses, presales, advisor shares, so on and so forth. By the time the house of cards came crashing down, this procedure was a well-oiled machine.

And like each penny stock boom before it, the ICO boom ended in multiple regulatory actions against the worst offenders. But regulators can't reach everyone, and so many of the pump and dumpers have gone on unpunished.

So what can we learn from this?

While Bitcoin and Ether appreciated significantly during the bubble, it's clear the bubble driven first by ICOs, and it was ICOs that drove the bubble's collapse. ICOs also reinforced the supremacy of Bitcoin and Ether as the reserve currencies of ICO investing and the gateway to most crypto-only exchanges, where the bulk of ICO traffic resided.

Most of the long tail of ICOs (and the tail was very long) were complete nonsense. According to most trackers, the total number of ICOs was well into the thousands, and doubtless more if you count the ICOs that even they didn't bother counting.

Penny stocks naturally attract hustlers and cons. By 1989, in the heyday of penny stocks, a survey found that Americans had been cheated out of [at least $2B a year by fraudulent penny stock schemes](http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-08/business/fi-1942_1_penny-stock). The ICO bubble was no different. The SATIS group estimated in 2018 that [81% of ICOs were scams](https://www.investopedia.com/news/80-icos-are-scams-report/) and it's been widely reported that over [$9M was stolen per day in 2018](https://www.investopedia.com/news/beware-9m-are-lost-each-day-crypto-scams/) (annualized, that would be upwards of $3B a year).

ICOs, just as penny stocks, are a two-sided market. Investors don't care about the coins, they just want objects of speculation to get rich on. Fraudsters don't care about the coins either, they just want objects of manipulation to cheat others on. Everyone gets what they need, and so the market bustles with activity, and no one wants to be left out.

Despite the technological accoutrements, it's an old story.

# III. The P2P Filesharing Boom

Bitcoin shares deep roots with P2P filesharing networks. Bitcoin's gossip protocol model was inspired by Gnutella (the protocol behind Limewire). Many P2P barons have found their way into cryptocurrencies: Jed McCaleb of eDonkey, Zooko Wilcox of Mojo Nation, and Bram Cohen of BitTorrent to name a few.

I imagine most of you lived through the P2P filesharing revolution first-hand, but it's worth briefly rehashing its history.

The P2P filesharing revolution began with Napster in 1999, launched by Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker. At its peak in 2001, Napster possessed north of 25M simultaneous users.

Napster would fall prey to numerous lawsuits, where it was deemed liable for its users' copyright infringement, despite the fact that Napster's servers did not themselves host the copyrighted content. This legal doctrine, known as *vicarious infringement*, was the death knell of Napster and of any filesharing-related business model. But it was only the beginning of P2P filesharing.

The shutdown of Napster led to other, more resilient and decentralize services arising, intentionally designed around this legal constraint. Successors like Gnutella (Limewire) and eDonkey (eMule) would have decentralized architectures that would be much more difficult to take down.

BitTorrent would arguably be the last protocol in this evolution. Founded by Bram Cohen in 2001, BitTorrent would be much more optimized for minimizing bandwidth and optimizing file availability. By 2012, BitTorrent peaked at a staggering [150M monthly active users](https://web.archive.org/web/20140326102305/http://www.bittorrent.com/intl/es/company/about/ces_2012_150m_users) (15% of the entire [Facebook userbase](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/feb/04/facebook-in-numbers-statistics) at that time). During its heyday, BitTorrent was by far the [largest source of Internet traffic in the world](https://www.webcitation.org/6OVSh9hZ0?url=http://www.ipoque.com/sites/default/files/mediafiles/documents/internet-study-2008-2009.pdf).

Simon Morris, a former executive at the BitTorrent company, wrote an excellent [four-part tour de force](https://medium.com/@simonhmorris/why-bittorrent-mattered-bittorrent-lessons-for-crypto-1-of-4-fa3c6fcef488) analyzing the parallels between BitTorrent and crypto (if you can't be bothered to read the whole thing, I encourage you to read its final quarter). I'll be drawing upon many of his insights here.

Simon Morris points out: BitTorrent was intentionally structured to differently from other P2P filesharing companies.

The original home page of BitTorrent begins its [explanation of BitTorrent](http://www.bittorrent.org/introduction.html) as: "BitTorrent is a free speech tool." Compare this to KaZaA's advertising:

![KaZaA advertising](https://i.imgur.com/O4pkz2j.png)

Bram explicitly disavowed all illegal filesharing usage of BitTorrent. The core team and their messaging was unimpeachable, and this allowed BitTorrent to flourish on the back of all of its legitimate usage: Linux distros, World of Warcraft updates, dataset sharing, and the like. BitTorrent was not a revolution in internet piracy, it was a revolution in digital distribution. This stance made BitTorrent safely beyond the reach of the RIAA or any other aggrieved copyright holder.  

The parallel with crypto is interesting: Vitalik and the Ethereum core team never endorsed the flood of ICOs, and often decried them. This is precisely what allowed Ethereum to flourish despite its subversion by ICOs for illegal and speculative purposes. Ethereum has been praised as a revolution in decentralized computing, "the world computer," despite its apparent status as the world's wildest penny stock exchange.

Fast forward to today, and the story of P2P filesharing is the story of BitTorrent. All other protocols have been lost to history at this point. But BitTorrent is no longer used to music downloads in the western world.

Why?

The reason is simple: the media industry adapted. iTunes, Spotify, Apple Music, and other similar services have improved the experience 10x, such that it's no longer compelling to Torrent your music rather than just build your cross-device music library on Spotify's cloud.

Simon Harris puts it eloquently:

> Bittorrent was surely successful in this: it forced the media industry to think harder. In the light of the Bittorrent ecosystem, it simply wasn’t going to be possible to charge users to re-purchase all their music in MP3 format the same way they taxed users who wanted to transfer from vinyl to cassette to CD. In spite of ever more sophisticated copy protection technologies, ‘revenue protection’ service offerings and showcase trials and punishments, what actually happened as a result of this grand showdown between entrenched interests and technology wielded by the masses was not the victory of one side or the other, but the emergence of something totally different and radically better. In short, the whole concept of “the file” disappeared from sight and we watched the rebirth of old media in a new and better form (e.g. Spotify and Netflix) and the emergence of new media (e.g. YouTube and Instagram) all with experience-oriented value propositions and business models.

It's much easier to consume music through streaming services now, and consumers are more than willing to pay a small subscription fee for the convenience. The UX has improved dramatically—by comparison, tracking down Torrents for individual albums seems unduly manual and laborious.

(Note: most of the Torrenting today is film, which makes sense as it's splintered across many relatively high-cost subscription services: Netflix, HBO, Hulu, soon Disney, and many countries don't have licensing deals to have this content available on day 1. This will likely continue if not intensify–piracy services serve as a kind of price discrimination, where high value customers are willing to pay streaming services for on-demand, cross-device convenience, whereas poorer users self-select into online piracy. Because of the bandwidth-intensiveness of video torrenting, BitTorrent still comprises some [20% of all online upstream traffic](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/d3q45v/bittorrent-usage-increases-netflix-streaming-sites), which skews significantly higher in the poorest parts of the world.)

Make no mistake: the internet piracy revolution moved industries. It forced them to improve their experience and cater to a digital-first world. Those who did have been passed the baton and get to build out their media empires, and those who did not are footnotes in corporate history.

So what was P2P filesharing all about then? Was it that young people were rebelling against copyrights or intellectual property laws? Of course not—the filesharing revolution was not about ideology, and very few of its adherents today have an ideological commitment to piracy. It was simply that there was a rule in place: that music must be purchased in stores, in fusty old disc jackets for $10 a pop. You can't rip it, you can't manipulate it, you can't share it—it's not yours.

People hated this rule. And so they broke it, and P2P protocols enabled this great, overwhelming mob of rulebreakers to express their desires.

The market listened to them, responded, and now music acquisition is great. Internet pirates are now in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and many no longer remember the relationship they once had with downloaded media.

The benefit of decentralized technology, then, is to allow the rules to be broken.

Why did ICOs need to be decentralized? To Simon Morris, the answer is obvious—because ICOs were about breaking rules, the rules around capital formation.

>Without this sort of rule-breaking (whether by accident or design) it’s quite hard to imagine why decentralized blockchain technology even matters. It’s a distributed data store with a complicated and slow update mechanism... The one value proposition that everyone seems to agree on for blockchain technologies is that they are ‘censor-proof’. And this matters only if you have something that someone wants to censor.

Before the ICO bubble,
