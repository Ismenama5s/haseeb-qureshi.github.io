Hey guys,

There's so much I could write, but I'm not ready to write it yet. I have spent quite some time now in Croatia. It's a fucking beautiful country. This entry will purely be photographs of the beautiful Croatia. Along with a badass song for accompaniment.

Tomorrow I plan to head back down to the coast and then take a ferry to Italy, and then travel up through the Italian countryside. I will write more soon, but I wanted to share these photos because there's so much amazing stuff I've seen in this country. It's definitely been one of my favorites. More soon.

Back on the road,
