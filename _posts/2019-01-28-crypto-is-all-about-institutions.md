# It seems like the wrong language to describe what's going on in crypto. People imagine institutions in crypto as a bike stand that will eventually get kicked away, or the gear on a space shuttle that will be abandoned once it achieves lift-off. I think this is incredibly unlikely within the next decade, and we should not treat it that way.

# PEOPLE PUT TOO LITTLE EMPHASIS WITHIN CRYPTO ON BUILDING INSTITUTIONS. BUT INSTITUTIONS ARE WHAT MATTER, THEY ARE THE AREA IN WHICH YOU MUST COMPETE
# GIVE EXAMPLES & DEFINITION OF INSTITUTIONS
# Institutions: schools, police, roads, courts, legal precedent, culture, etc. These are all institutions. It's a big word that captures everything consistent.
# What are the institutions in crypto? Strong property rights. Infura. Metamask. Metatransactions. These are all parts of infrastructure, but there's more than that. The most important barrier to forking are *institutions*.

Most cryptocurrency pioneers would not call what they're building "institutions." The term wreaks of centralization—it's too unsexy. (Except when it's "institutional capital", then it's welcomed with open arms.)

In a recent [debate between Katie Haun and Paul Krugman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOXYbmKRTsQ) on cryptocurrencies, Paul Krugman is asked why he rejects the decentralized vision behind cryptocurrencies. He responds:

> "We developed this socially ingenious thing: social institutions [...] it's going to be really, really hard to come up with something better."

This is an unpopular view within the crypto world, but he's absolutely right.

Ask what has led to the economic vitality of the most advanced nations in the world, and we pretty much know the answer: it's robust social institutions. If you improve a country's institutions, the society inevitably flourishes economically, socially, and ethically. Institutions are invaluable, difficult to replicate, and hard-won through generations of social and political toil.

So if crypto is trying to make the world better, why be so quick to circumvent social institutions? By embracing cryptocurrencies, aren't we throwing away the *one thing* we know works?

Not so fast. In fact, **crypto is all about social institutions**. Specifically, it's about scalable, global, decentralized institutions—institutions that survive any particular group, country, or time.

## What we mean when we talk about institutions

"Institution" is an intentionally broad term. According to [XYZ], institutions can be defined as {ABCDEFG}. Canonical examples of institutions are schools, police, court systems, and the cultural norms that regulate normative behavior.

Institutions are hard to build.

One of the promises of the Internet was that it would create a global informational commons. Once all of the world's information was packetized and hosted on public servers, every human would have access to the corpus of human knowledge. You can think of this as the world's biggest library: a globally scalable social institution.

And this mostly came true! For the majority of humans anywhere in the world, if they want to access the world's information, they can run a Google or Wikipedia search and find it. Google is now a deep social institution almost everywhere in the world where it operates.

Notably, this was built once and then enjoyed everywhere. There's no need to rebuild Google for Brazil or Burundi. There's just one Google—all you need to do is translate the UI, and everyone in the world can enjoy a search index over the world's information (to a first approximation).

If this sounds obvious, it's because we now take this scalability for granted. For most of human history, delivering a good or service across the world was a feat of conquest and empire. Now it just requires having a computer with an open port.

And yet, if you look at finance, the story is the complete opposite. Every country has its own walled-off and homegrown financial infrastructure. Each nation must design and staff its own iteration of these institutions: banks, credit systems, exchanges, and legal structures to regulate them, else suffer being a financial backwater.

We know this. But when most of the money in the world is already digital—why isn't money more like the Internet?

With cryptocurrencies, anyone is free to plug into a global financial system, bank, savings account, payment rail, public registry, and system of contracts. Innovation in this sphere can be shared with everyone. Crypto is, in that sense, the first global financial commons. It purports to do to money what the Internet did to information.

Currently, citizens have relatively weak tools to combat corrupt monetary policy or weak local institutions. They can try to circumvent capital controls, they can engage in gray or black markets, they can dollarize, they can divest into gold. But in the future there will be another, more powerful option: adopt cryptocurrencies. This solution will allow them to opt into a global digital economy and financial system, complete with mature financial services.

So it's incorrect to say that crypto will replace institutions. Instead, what crypto will do is build competing *decentralized institutions*. These decentralized institutions will be more portable and global, they will operate autonomously, and they will offer financial technology to the rest of the world that doesn't currently have it. In a world where more than 50 countries have undergone [hyperinflation in the last century](https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/workingpaper-8.pdf), cryptocurrencies will serve as a powerful check against wayward financial stewards.

The best antidote against bad governance is competition. Cryptocurrencies are the only serious competitor against centralized financial infrastructure. Economic choice, the power to exit, and the ability for citizens to coordinate is *precisely* what leads to better local governance and institutions in the longer run.

## Decentralized institutions

So let's talk about decentralized institutions. Many cryptoanarchists would consider this term nonsensical—the whole point of decentralization, they'd claim, is to abolish institutions.

I disagree. Institutions are critical to any cryptocurrency.

[Institutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution) are what give a group its social and philosophical coherence over time. Institutions enforce rules and norms. They ensure graceful transitions of power, and they allow the individuals within that society to conduct their business safely, peacefully, and predictably.

This might sound at odds with a system like Ethereum where "code is law." A fundamental property of most cryptocurrencies is immutability. No authority, no matter how strong, can seize your assets without control of your private key.

But make no mistake, this too is a part of Ethereum's institutions: its norm around strong property rights.

In Ethereum for example, there are continual debates over [property rights](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-867), [governance](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/strange-loop-an-ethereum-governance-framework-proposal/268), and [economic policy](https://ethresear.ch/t/common-classes-of-contracts-and-how-they-would-handle-ongoing-storage-maintenance-fees-rent/4441). There have been times where its governance has favored safety and restitution over property rights (e.g., [the DAO fork](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-executes-blockchain-hard-fork-return-dao-investor-funds)), and other times when it has weighed in favor of immutability (e.g., rejecting the [Parity rescue fork](https://www.parity.io/on-classes-of-stuck-ether-and-potential-solutions/)). These are fluid ideas and they manifest differently at different times.

Users, companies, miners, and developers all depend on the continuity of the Ethereum ecosystem. They participate in Ethereum because they believe it will fulfill its promises—in other words, they participate because *they trust in the underlying institutions*. These institutions encompass more than just the governance process—they are also the code, the economics, and the community behind Ethereum.

These institutions span many platforms—Reddit, Twitter, forums, Gitter chatrooms, and Github issues. They extend into foundations and their headquarters, at developer meetups and conferences, and on open conference calls. It's not merely the community or codebase that gives Ethereum its staying power: it's the emergent power of these institutions.

So when critics tout forkability as a check against these networks, they are missing something deep about what makes any financial system valuable. It's not the software, not the balances in the accounts, not the size of the userbase. **It's the institutions.**

Imagine a rebel army that carves out a subsection of a country. It might establish a junta, brandish a flag, and call itself a competing state. But few would find it an attractive alternative to the original. Likewise, a fork that does not manage to improve on its originating institutions is uncompelling to anyone but those designed to profit from it. A large fundraise and a well-stocked war chest is not enough: institutions cannot be bought, only built. This fact has borne out by the fact that [almost all forks have failed](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2018/9/17/a-brief-study-of-cryptonetwork-forks) (the most notable exception being Monero).

I'd be remiss if I didn't also discuss ICOs. ICOs are the apotheosis of why institutions matter. Lately I was revisiting some of my writing from when I first started blogging about crypto [last year](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/blockchain-is-our-first-22nd-century-technology-d4ad45fca2ce):

>It’s unfortunate that right now, blockchain-as-speculation is dominating most people’s attention. The signal is getting drowned in the noise.
>
> But that’s to be expected. We’ve seen this before.
>
> When people first realized the extraordinary potential of the internet, tons of money was pumped into random dot coms. Anticipating mass adoption and astronomical value creation, speculation fed speculation, until the frenzy finally crashed in 2001.
>
> What’s going on right now is comparable. There will eventually be a comedown.

It's become clear to the market now that the ICO boom was primarily a globally unregulated penny stocks market. ICOs did not disrupt venture capital—they made a parody of it. It will take some time for crypto to clean itself off, cast out the scammers and profiteers, fix the incentives, and start focusing again on building serious things.

Going forward, we will need to develop real institutions around how projects get funding: more norms around transparency, disclosures, advisors, partnerships, lockups and liquidity restrictions, and what it means to both create and capture value. Organizations like Messari and Gemini are great trailblazers in self-regulation, but there's more work to be done.

**This is the only way to win people over in the end.** Not by shouting at them that they're not decentralized enough, but by *showing them that your institutions are a compelling alternative to their own.*

## The path forward

Crypto is not just technological innovation. It's also social and political innovation. To build something valuable takes time, patience, and a lot of mistakes.

If you're just benchmarking on prices, it might look like crypto has failed at this project. Reading Twitter and Bloomberg, you might be convinced crypto is dead (it recently celebrated its [300th obituary](https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoinobituaries/)).

But the arc of change is long. Paul Krugman clearly agrees on this point: it doesn't happen in a year or two. It's hard stuff.

To be sure, most technological revolutions started with speculative frenzies—[railroads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_Mania), [automobiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_defunct_automobile_manufacturers_of_the_United_States), [video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_crash_of_1983), and the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble) are just a few examples. Crypto will be no different. Indeed, the nature of the technology will likely magnify these cycles.

This is okay. Expect this. The ICO bubble of 2017 won't be the last bubble in crypto, nor will it be the last time crypto is pronounced dead.

I am in this for the long-term. Short-term speculators leaving the market is fine, as they are a distraction. The real value is in creating institutions that will last, that will compel others to join these new systems. Changing the world takes time, sweat, and a lot of focus. To quote myself from a year ago:

>But when the dust is cleared, like after the dot com crash, those who were serious — the Microsofts, the Amazons, the Googles — will have to come in and do the graceless work of building the future.
>
>There’s much work to do.
