Hey gang,

Wanted to feature a really in-depth interview I did on Quoracast with my old friend Jeff Meyerson (also known as Crablar back in the day). We discuss in detail my early poker years, living with Dan &ldquo;Jungleman12&rdquo; Cates and Ashton &ldquo;ASHMAN103â€³ Griffin, and the infamous Million Dollar Bet.

Give it a listen, and subscribe to [Quoracast](http://quoracast.quora.com/) if you enjoy it!
