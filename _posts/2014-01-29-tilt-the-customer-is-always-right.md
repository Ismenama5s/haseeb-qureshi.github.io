Today, I've got a special treat: I recorded a preview of the audiobook! Hear a great section from the book, &ldquo;Tilt: the Customer is Always Right,&rdquo; which teaches how to play optimally against a tilting player.

Of course, you also get to enjoy my chocolatey voice in its full aural deliciousness. It's okay, it's not weird that you like it. It just makes you more of a man.

Hope you enjoyed! The audiobook should be released soon; I'll be working through the recording this weekend. Look forward to it, and be sure to pick it up once it comes outâ€“you know, so I'm not wearing out my voice for nothing.
