Many blockchain advocates are mystified why laypeople don't trust cryptocurrencies. They claim that with the advent of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, you no longer need to trust financial institutions. Once you remove centralized authorities, money becomes trustless, or so they say.

And yet the vast majority of people don't trust cryptocurrencies. "Obviously those people don't understand the innovations behind blockchains," blockchain advocates claim. As though a simple lecture on consensus protocols should be all it takes to give a person a sedating dose of credulity.

It's completely reasonable not to trust Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin is not trustless. In fact, Bitcoin requires more trust than most fiat financial systems.

**The key innovation of cryptocurrencies is that they decentralize trust. They do not eliminate it.** To believe otherwise is like believing that a piece of land becoming a community commons means its grass will always stay green. It's a total non sequitur. **put brilliant analogy here**

In reality, there's no such thing as trustlessness. Trust is a relationship of epistemic confidence. And aside from tautologies like the cogito, trust is always bounded.

Take science for example. Why do you trust science?

Every study you trust you probably didn't read yourself. Even for those you did, you didn't read all the literature they cited, you didn't double-check the dataset or re-run the regressions yourself. (Ironically, you probably won't be able to—most published scientific results are not replicable.)

You trust science because you are delegating your trust your scientific consensus. This usually works, but sometimes it doesn't. Science is not trustless. There is no free lunch when it comes to epistemology.

What about cryptocurrencies?

Decentralized cryptocurrencies imply you don't have to trust a central party. But all that means is that you're placing your trust elsewhere. You didn't read all the source code yourself. You didn't vet the full nodes who run the software. You didn't inspect every update or hard fork to understand what it does. And you probably don't run a full node yourself, so you're explicitly trusting the full nodes you do connect to.

You are trusting the developers to build good and honest software. You are trusting the miners not to collude. You are trusting the nation-states and corporations who have both the motivation and capital to shut down mining, or launch a 51% attack. You are trusting the markets and that they're not being manipulated (or that if they are, they're being manipulated in your favor). You are trusting miners and bad actors not to frontrun you, or grief you, or attack the contracts you use. You are trusting exchanges to hold your assets and not get hacked, or not to hide it from you if they do get hacked.

Sure, in a simplified adversarial model where you hand-wave away all the details, cryptocurrencies have elegant security properties. But in reality, there's a great ocean of trust that fills in all those gaps you waved away.

Real engineering is what fills those gaps. And real engineering takes time. Lots, and lots, and lots of time.

Even still, 9 years after the creation of Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies have a lot of lingering unknowns. Do you trust that the consensus protocols are actually correct, and don't have any lurking major vulnerabilities? Do you trust that quantum computers won't come along and break all the public-key cryptography? Do you trust fees won't just balloon to becoming unusable? Do you trust that cryptocurrencies will scale, and won't just collapse under transaction congestion? Do you trust that even if they do succeed, nation-states won't just see them and immediately replicate their successes, except this time with the backing of their geopolitical power?

It should go without saying that the US dollar requires a lot less trust than Bitcoin. No one can break the US dollar. But a motivated nation-state or corporation could easily manipulate or destroy Bitcoin. And they would probably face meager consequences for it.

Engineering is all about tradeoffs. And cryptocurrencies have different security properties than fiat currencies. Seldom is one system strictly better than another—more often, it's a question of what set of tradeoffs you choose.

If you believe currencies controlled by nation-states are untrustworthy, then perhaps you trust Bitcoin over fiat. This is what the original cypherpunks believed—they wanted a refuge from central banks and nation-states, which they believed always tended toward corruption.

I think they're probably wrong. The monetary system built by nation states are more robust and trustworthy than those built by decentralized swarms of open-source developers in the last eight years. And that's likely to continue for a long time.

The large fiat currencies are are very trustworthy, almost by definition. I say this not just because of their stability and ubiquity, but also by the enormous edifice of engineering and commerce built on top of them, which has yet to crack. Trust is a relationship, and it's clear that most people trust their currencies.

Here's the thing. Bitcoin requires lots of trust, and that's okay. Early on in any system's lifespan, *of course it requires trust*. It's an experiment. You have to try it out and see what happens.

But if cryptocurrencies win in the long run, it won't be because they're trustless. They're not. If they win, **it'll be because they're better**. They'll have to provide actual substantive value over fiat currencies.

Some of that might be in regulatory or legal arbitrage. I don't discount that possibility, but I doubt it'll be the clincher.

Decentralization may be some of the value add. There are some great game theoretic properties you acquire when there's no central party.

But I suspect it will be in <fees, international payments, faster clearing time, cheaper fees, making>

For all the mania surrounding them, cryptocurrencies are still a deeply subversive idea. They're a re-imagination of what money can be. Instead of money being contract between people and a nation-state, cryptocurrencies ask the question: what if money was just a contract among people? What if the monetary system became a global community commons? Owned by everyone, managed by everyone, protected by everyone? No states involved.

It's a radical idea, and one of the most fascinating financial innovations in the last 50 years. As far as ideas go, I think it's a pretty good one.

But it's risky.

Don't let anyone convince you it's not.
