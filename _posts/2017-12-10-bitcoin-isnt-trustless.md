Bitcoin is not trustless. It's not even obvious that they require less trust than the traditional financial system. They simply redistribute trust, and have different properties.

Many blockchain devotees are mystified that people don't trust cryptocurrencies. Obviously — they argue — these people don't understand the underlying idea. They must not grasp how blockchain technology works, and they just need a sufficient dose of enlightenment.

Trust is always bounded. Why do you trust scientists, or scientific consensus? You will seldom read every study you trust yourself, or refer to primary sources and re-check the results and analyses yourselves. (Ironically, you wouldn't be able to—most published results are not even replicable.)

Even within cryptocurrencies themselves, they're far from trustless. Sure, in the simplified model of cryptocurrencies, they might be quite secure. But in reality, there's a great deal of miner centralization, most people don't run full nodes themselves.

The interesting thing about cryptocurrencies is not that they're trustless. It's that the trust is more diffuse. It's that no single party has unilateral control over cryptocurrencies, and that's cool. But parties still have control over cryptocurrencies, and that's problematic.

It's that their trust properties are different.

The United States government is very trustworthy. This is evidenced by an enormous edifice of global commerce trusting it.

Cryptocurrencies have a lot of unknowns. Are they actually correct? Will catastrophic bugs be uncovered at some point in the future? What if nation-states or powerful attackers want to break it? Will they scale large enough to actually serve as a viable currency/platform?

Many people would rightly point out that anyone who trusts Bitcoin is putting a lot more trust in the system than people who trust the USD—no one can break the US dollar, but a sufficiently motivated nation-state or corporation could easily manipulate or destroy Bitcoin and face only meager consequences.

 Cryptocurrencies have different security properties than fiat currencies. They also bestow different game theoretic properties. If you believe its more trustworthy to have a currency not directly controlled by a state, then great, that's what you believe. Indeed, this is what the original cypherpunks believed—they didn't trust central banks or nation states. I think they're probably wrong—the monetary system built by major nation states are more robust and trustworthy than those built by ragtag swarms of open source developers.

 But all cryptocurrencies mean is that you're placing your trust elsewhere. You didn't read all the software yourself, you don't vet all the nodes who run the software, you don't inspect every update to see what it's doing, most of the time you don't even run a full node yourself, implicitly trusting any full node you connect to. The system is full of trust. Decentralized does not mean trustless.

 The question is "how much trust are you placing in the system"?

 If cryptocurrencies win, it won't be because they're trustless. They're not. They'll win because they're better, and because they provide actual substantive value over and above fiat currencies.

 Some of that value might be in regulatory or legal arbitrage. That's a possibility, I don't discount it—but it's yet to prove as much.

 Decentralization may be a value. There are some great game theoretic properties and cryptographic properties you can acquire when you don't need to trust a central party in some kind of game where the central party should not be trusted, or is inevitably incentivized toward corruption.

 This would be like arguing that hey, we made this land owned by everyone. It's now a public commons. Therefore, it's trustless. No, no, no. The system is still full of trust—you simply don't need to trust a central party. But all of your work of establishing a secure and robust system is still ahead of you.

 Cryptocurrencies are a re-imagination of what a currency can be. Instead of currencies being a contract between people and a nation-state, currencies are now just a contract among people. No states involved. This is a radical and subversive idea. And, to a first approximation, I think it's a good one. But we'll see how it pans out.

* We all want a trustable or trustworthy system. Cryptocurrencies are not trustless, they just decentralize the trust. Instead of having to trust X, Y, Z, etc. etc. AND we have to, at bottom, trust the bottom-most party. Cryptocurrencies cut out the state. They re-imagine the contract between humans and money, to cut out the nation-state or corporation entirely. This is a radical and subversive idea. It's also one of the most fascinating ones in the last 50 years of financial innovation.

* People complain about Bitcoin and fraud. Having worked in the anti-fraud industry, fraud is going up. Things will get worse before they get better. Bitcoin, in the long run, is a step in the right direction—to push the security onto the client, rather than onto the merchants and the underlying infrastructure. Right now in the normal world, fraud is getting worse and worse, harder and harder to combat, and easier and easier to scale. Fraudsters are getting more sophisticated, more automated. All of the things we're afraid of about automation and AI—they all apply to cybersecurity and digital fraud as well.

* Bitcoin moves the risk onto the end user. This is a radically different idea. But it's also clear that people want insurance. And to offer insurance, the easiest way to do it is to own the Bitcoin and its interface directly.
