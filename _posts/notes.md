# The 3 Competing Explanations for the ICO Bubble

* Begin by emphasizing that I believe in crypto, think it'll change the world. But it's clear that the ICO bubble was not it. Many commentators, myself included, realized that this was an unsustainable frenzy. But I'll admit at the time, I didn't understand it. While I and many others analogized it loosely with the dot com bubble, this was a simplistic reading of what was going on. There was, in truth, a lot more to it and this was not the only way to read what happened.
* History does not repeat, but it rhymes, and a single beat can belong to several rhythms.
* Start by specifying the massive scope of the ICO bubble
  - About $6B raised in 2017, 8.5B in 2018 (https://www.icodata.io/stats/2018)
  - When it popped, the "market capitalization" of cryptocurrencies dropped 342B USD. (This is problematic for several reasons, but let's ignore that.)
  - By September 2018, it collapsed 80% from its peak in January, making it worse than the Dot com bubble's 78% collapse.
* I. Then, penny stocks, boiler rooms, etc.
  - Defined as a stock that trades below $5 (antiquated name).
  - Balaji: the internet becomes a stock market
  - Well, not quite. It became a penny stock market.
  - Images of boiler rooms, the Wolf of Wall Street, etc.
  - Has very low liquidity, lots of pump and dumping, and lots of promotion and manipulation.
  - 1929 market crash caused by unbridled penny stock craziness
  - Through most of the 20th century, penny stock orders were placed on the phone. They were mostly traded OTC, and information weren't placed in newspapers.
  - The highest tier penny stocks actually disclosed information to investors and had annual financial reporting. The lowest tier had none of this.
  - "Pink sheet" penny stocks were ones that printed quotes on pink paper before circulating them, making them very high-quality.
  - Starting in the mid-1990s, penny stock trading exploded with growth, fueled by the growth of the internet. Before the internet, the only way to trade penny stocks was by phone.
  - Now with the internet, penny stock discount brokers emerged. Investors were lured to them by the promises of cheap trading fees and the potential to get risk.
  - The mafia had been manipulating penny stock markets since the 1970s, leading to the Penny Stock Reform Act of the 1990s. But it was well-known that the mafia continued to manipulate penny stocks.
  - LEXG was a big example of this: Lithium exploration group, which grew in market cap to $350M on the basis of a direct mail compaign. In reality, it had no assets whatsoever, and no revenue (this filing was made several months after the mail campaign ended).
  - By 1989, a survey found that Americans had been cheated out of at least $2B a year by penny stock schemes (http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-08/business/fi-1942_1_penny-stock)
  - Most ICOs were penny stocks. There were a few blue chip companies (Bitcoin, etc.), but most of the rest was a penny stock craziness.
  - How much does this explain though?
* II. Then Carlotta Perez—yes, much to say here! (The Dot Com Bubble)
  - "All bubbles are about greed and her behavior regulation tries to avoid their worst excesses, but some bubbles are also about the installation of technological revolutions and making overall paradigm shifts."
  - "There have been five technological revolutions in 240 years..."
  - "Why call them revolutions, though? Because they go far beyond the powerful set of new industries; they also transform the whole economy by providing a new techno-economic paradigm."
    - What is the new techno-economic paradigm? The new way of doing things? Creating a decentralized protocol, a whitepaper, a Swiss foundation, a public sale, all open source, and oh, you should hire a cryptographer and make sure you're quantum-resistant.
  - Carlota Perez subscribes to the cycle theory of K-waves (Kondratiev Waves), in which technological innovation waves occur every 45-60 years. Under this timing, if we accept her designation that the information and telecommunications age started in 1971, then if we accept that financial capital began becoming aware of crypto with the advent of Ethereum, that lands us at 2015 when Ethereum launched—exactly 44 years since Intel announced its first microprocessor, the Intel 4004, in 1971.
  - Each technological revolution builds on and requires the last—just as the Internet bootstrapped itself through the telegraph and telephone systems that were built in the early 20th century (dial-up internet), blockchains bootstrap themselves on innovations in late-stage Internet and broadband culture (blockchains would be impossible as an approach to consensus and data storage if not for SSDs, extremely cheap storage in the hands of consumers, and massive improvements in broadband Internet)
  - These cycles take place in two phases: the Installation Period (which is comprised of first "Irruption" then "Frenzy"), then the Deployment Period, (describe it here).
    - "During Installation, investment is led by financial capital, which funds the technological transformation, and, in the excitement, also intensifies its casino-type activities until it decouples from the real economy building a major asset inflation boom that ends in catastrophic collapse."
  - The technological revolution is typified by a new *techno-economic* paradigm. What is a techno-economic paradigm? In short, it's the new accepted way of doing things. It's the almost obvious set of business practices that everyone follows because it is the "new way of doing things." In fact, it's low status not to follow them.
  - "The emerging heuristic routines and approaches are gradually internalized by engineers and managers, investors and bankers, sales and advertising people, entrepreneurs and consumers. In time, a shared logic is established; a new \"common sense\" is accepted for investment decisions as well as for consumer choice. The old ideas are unlearned and the new ones become \"normal\"."
  - The installation period is primarily captured by Financial capital.
    - "Financial capital then breaks loose, backs the new entrepreneurs, dismantles as much as it can of the institutional framework, overinvests in the new infrastructure, and also uses the new technologies to innovate in instruments for financial speculation."
    - "When the resulting bubble collapses, the state needs to come back actively to regulate finance and favor the new and renewed production capital, which can then lead the expansion using the installed potential for growth and innovation."
  - On frenzy:
    - "Frenzy is the tumultuous period when financial capital takes off on its own."
    - "All those benefitting from this flourishing of opportunities believe the world is going through a marvelous time."
      - New millionaires are minted. They want to multiply their wealth in the same way that they made it, so they redeploy their capital with high pressure to generate more profits.
      - The newly rich believe it's their own superior insight and intuition that led to this growth.
    - "As the various assets go up in price, confidence grows that they will continue to do so."
    - "There are areas of the world that happen to be in a position, for national, international, historical, and geographic reasons, to make a catching-up leap with the new paradigm."
      - Switzerland, Dubai, Malta, Singapore, Estonia?
    - "In particular, towards the end of Frenzy, the financiers (and the investors who trust their money to them) seem to be convinced that they have discovered the most profitable vein. They then indulge in the intense repetition of the same successful recipe, be it from canals from any river to any river, as in the first revolution, or more dot coms and telecommunications, as in the current fifth."
      - Canals were created in the 1790s from river to river with no regards for useful routing.
      - Railways were created in the 1840s where demand was doubtful and engineering was impractical.
      - Real estate values in the 1920s were unmoored from the constraints of urban centers because of the automobile, since any territory could be potentially valuable if connected by roads.
      - Dot coms were created in the 1990s with no evidence of underlying demand.
      - The gap between paper values and real values widen. This accelerates the diffusion of the paradigm.
      - High technological velocity creates new products before users have learned or amortized their investment in previous products. Intense technological exploration occurs.
    - "Since the profits to be had are amazing, everybody—including widows and orphans—eventually becomes aware of the incredible possibilities. They gradually dare to enter what used to be alien territory, trying to get a piece of the action."
      - She quotes Bruce Nussbaum in Business Week about the late 90s:
        - "So investors accepted sky-high P/Es, puffed-up bottom lines, and some strange business plans—because who really knew what was possible? It was a time of opportunity, a time to place bets. And they paid off..."
    - "That permissive atmosphere generates an opacity that is highly convenient for corruption and for the flourishing of outright illegal activities."
    - "Individual interest in glorified; social interest scorned. Being rich is 'good'; anything else is a failure."
    - "This is then a time for swindlers."
    - "The other two structural tensions stem from the same basic cause: the whole frenzy phenomenon is, at bottom, a huge process of income redistribution in favor of those directly or indirectly involved in the casino, which funds the massive process of creative destruction in the economy. That regressive distribution generates a double vicious cycle: one is economic, expressed in the market; the other is social, expressed in political terms. Both get worse as the bubble increases."
  - Is the installation phase — the crypto gilded age — now over? Many of those overnight crypto millionaires are now back to paupers.
    - This phase was unique for crypto because it was not spurred by financial capital! Instead it was retail, and it was *global* (this is due to the nature of the technology, allowing for global financial speculation by retail consumers in the first place)
  - But the key part of the installation phase is that, despite its frenzy and subsequent crash, financial capital attracts the funds necessary to install basic infrastructure and facilitate social learning. This paves the way for the full unfolding of the revolution during the Deployment phase.
* III. The P2P Filesharing Boom: Finally, filesharing let people break rules
  - The P2P filesharing craze began with Napster in 1999, launched by Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker.
  - Napster peaked February 2001 at 26.4 million simultaneous users. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_file_sharing)
  - After Napster was taken down, successors such as Gnutella (LimeWire) and eDonkey2000 (eMule) would succeed it, having more decentralized architectures that would be more difficult to censor.
    * However, it became impossible for businesses to build on top of these protocols due to the doctrine of "vicarious infringement."
    * The shutdown of each service would lead users to migrate to other competing services. This cycle continued, and a population coming online and viewing these reports in the news of prominent court cases and RIAA lawsuits spread awareness of online filesharing
  - BitTorrent would be the last in this evolution:
    - Founded by Bram Cohen in 2001, it was the last filesharing protocol that was much more optimized for minimizing bandwidth optimizing file availability
  - BitTorrent had well over 150 million MAUs in 2012 https://web.archive.org/web/20140326102305/http://www.bittorrent.com/intl/es/company/about/ces_2012_150m_users
  - BitTorrent is now barely used for music downloads in the western world. Why is this?
  - Simple reason. Spotify, Apple Music have become awesome. Much easier way to consume music rather than the music industry's rent-seeking via jewel cases and expensive markups on listening to one-song albums, etc. UX is way better!
  - (Note, most of the torrenting today is film, which makes sense as it's splintered across many subscription services: Netflix, HBO, Hulu, soon to be Disney, and some countries don't have licensing deals to get the content out on day 1. This will likely continue if not intensify—serves as a kind of price discrimination. https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/d3q45v/bittorrent-usage-increases-netflix-streaming-sites)
  - Simon Morris (ask him to edit this) points out: BitTorrent was intentionally structured to prevent legal action against the corp. Bram rejected all illegal filesharing usages for BitTorrent, and it explicitly disavowed them. Unimpeachable core team. Similar to Ethereum for all the ICOs on top of them. Vitalik and co never endorsed them, allowing the underlying product to flourish despite the subversion for illegal purposes.
  - So filesharing was valuable because it allowed people to break rules: rules around sharing music.  This was the heyday of filesharing, and it has been largely supplanted by Spotify and Apple Music, who captured most of the value here.
    - "Bittorrent was surely successful in this: it forced the media industry to think harder. In the light of the Bittorrent ecosystem, it simply wasn’t going to be possible to charge users to re-purchase all their music in MP3 format the same way they taxed users who wanted to transfer from vinyl to cassette to CD. In spite of ever more sophisticated copy protection technologies, ‘revenue protection’ service offerings and showcase trials and punishments, what actually happened as a result of this grand showdown between entrenched interests and technology wielded by the masses was not the victory of one side or the other, but the emergence of something totally different and radically better. In short, the whole concept of “the file” disappeared from sight and we watched the rebirth of old media in a new and better form (e.g. Spotify and Netflix) and the emergence of new media (e.g. YouTube and Instagram) all with experience-oriented value propositions and business models.

    Media everywhere stopped being about the file and started being about the experience. Consumers stopped fretting over ‘ownership’ of music or movies, and are now concerned entirely with access — the experience of just listening to what you want whenever you want, and watching great engaging shows and channels on-demand. Consumers don’t want to worry about where the digital file is, how long it will take to get, whether their device can play the file, or how often they can listen or watch. All these concerns are satisfied and the experience becomes a simple discovery mechanism and a play button."
    - So what about in crypto?
      - "Without this sort of rule-breaking (whether by accident or design) it’s quite hard to imagine why decentralized blockchain technology even matters. It’s a distributed data store with a complicated and slow update mechanism. While there are some qualities of blockchain architectures that are useful short of full decentralization, they hardly justify for the wilder “biggest-thing-since-the-internet” excitement. The one value proposition that everyone seems to agree on for blockchain technologies is that they are ‘censor-proof’. And this matters only if you have something that someone wants to censor. To my mind the most interesting blockchain projects out there are the ones that enable the breaking of rules."
    - The rules people wanted to break: the rules around capital formation. Tightly regulated all around the world, after seeing the frustration in people getting rich from the tech industry, stories of young entrepreneurs striking it big, and increasing income inequality all around the world and shrinking wage growth for the middle class, people are left asking... what about us?
    - We want to give everyone access. Can you predict the future? Can you see it coming faster than those older, more stodgy, more conservative than you? Then come play the crypto roulette. Your seat is already here, and here's your drink and your airdrop and your retweet incentive and your Telegram pump and dump group, now get to work predicting the future.
  - THIS EXPLAINS FROM THE SUPPLY SIDE! The supply side wants to break the rules. Individuals want to gamble, supply side wants to circumvent the onerous rules around capital formation. Why do only people from Stanford, people in Silicon Valley, etc. get to raise money? Why not people everywhere?
* What do each of these sides predict for the future?
  - Each narrative implies a different phenomenon within crypto.
  - Penny stocks = shitcoins, scams, unregistered securities, which were a big part of what happened in the ICO bubble.
  - Speculation at the height of a new techno-economic paradigm, this leads to VC coins and all of the respectable startups that were overcapitalized
    - The flood of entrepreneurs pattern-matching to how to raise money (backpropagation, the adversarial iterative process that leads to entrepreneurs satisfying what VCs want to see)
  - Breaking rules around capital formation—why do people want to break rules so badly? The rules they want to break are around capital formation. Why do they care so much about this rule? Rising income inequality, people want to make money fast. Overeducated young people see shrinking opportunity. Why wouldn't they let themselves believe that they can see the future, they can get rich off speculation like those who came before them? It's a way to jump the line, take advantage of your technological digital nativism (which in most other ways, simply disadvantages you).
    - The rules in place don't allow people to invest in these kinds of new technologies. You can't invest in high-growth startups that everyone is talking about. The new technology that will take over the world. Nerds in Silicon Valley can, but not you. We're all getting rich and you're not invited. https://nypost.com/2019/01/29/most-americans-believe-the-economy-is-rigged-to-favor-the-rich-poll/?mod=article_inline
  - https://www.barrons.com/articles/from-elizabeth-holmes-to-the-fyre-festival-we-love-to-hate-a-scam-51551374679?mod=RTA
    - This leads people to want to break these rules. And naturally, people learn the consequence of breaking those rules—a floodgate of scams, entrepreneurs working in bad faith, and widespread market manipulation. They relearn the lessons of traditional finance.
    - Are the cries for the legalization of crypto really about rules around capital formation? It's hard to know. I don't see that many people clamoring for it in 2019. It doesn't seem to have had that effect. It seems more plausible to me that the longer-lasting effects are around income inequality, this technological uncertainty, social mobility, and the deep desire for people to have more economic mobility than they have today.





## Dot Com Boom

* Mosaic browser was released in 1993, Netscape Navigator released in 1995, and by 1997 PC penetration was 35% of of American households. The consumer web had just been launched.

* This combined with low interest rates and cheap venture capital, incentivized by the Clinton tax cuts of 1997.

* Netscape kicked off the dot com bubble, IPOing for 2.9B. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape). It was somewhat unusual for an IPO to be so successful given that the company was not profitable, but its revenues were growing so rapidly, that would soon be forgotten. Netscape waved their advertisements that "The net is for everyone," and this was soon agreed. Netscape would soon be followed by Yahoo!, Excite, and Lycos, all fantastically successful IPOs by companies that were burning cash.

![Marc Andreessen Time Magazine Cover](https://i.imgur.com/uVZXZ8h.jpg)

* The internet itself became the interface for many of these investors. And they were eager to do so with their tax rebates, in fact pulling money out of many slower-growth companies to do so.

* Many legendary value investors, such as Julian Robertson of Tiger Management, could not understand the market exuberance. In his letter to investors as he closed down the fund, he lamented: "In a rational environment, [value investing] functions well. But in an irrational market, where earnings and price considerations take a back seat to mouse clicks and momentum, such logic, as we have learned, does not count for much."" (https://money.cnn.com/2000/03/30/mutualfunds/q_funds_tiger/)

* Many stories of white collar professionals quitting their jobs to daytrade full-time. (http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,991726,00.html)

* In just five years, the NASDAQ rose more than 400%. The logic of frenzy had taken over.

* A famous WSJ article from 1999 poses the question: are profits just a "quaint concept" that don't matter anymore? A technocracy was arriving, and in this world value would not be defined by P/E ratios but by Metcalfe's Law.

* The Super Bowl in January of 2000 featured no fewer than 16 dot com commercials. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_commercials_during_Super_Bowl_XXXIV)

* Companies went from incorporation to IPO in a single year, like Pets.com which raised $82.5M in its IPO. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pets.com)


* At the height of the bubble, almost every single IPO popped, with an average of 68% first-day gains. (https://money.cnn.com/1999/12/27/investing/century_ipos/) Investing in tech IPOs seemed to be a foolproof way to multiply your money.

![Biggest IPO pops](https://money.cnn.com/1999/12/27/investing/century_ipos/ipo.jpg)

* The phenomenon of dot com parties spread across the Valley. (https://www.salon.com/2000/04/25/party_5/) It was a time of excess, of good fortune, of celebration.

* But the end was in sight. By March 10, 2000, the NASDAQ would hit its peak. The first sign of a selloff was April 14, likely triggered by a tax selloff for the previous year's gains. By the end of that week, the NASDAQ tumbled 25%. Soon, companies began to realize that their spend rates were unsustainable. The Fed announced plans to aggressively raise interest rates, and the economy would see six such hikes over the next several months.

* By May 18, Boo.com went bust. In November, Pets.com followed. A few months later, Webvan closed up shop. By the end of 2001, after the September 11 attacks, a majority of publicly traded dot coms had folded, and trillions of dollars of investment capital evaporated. The US would only emerge from this recession in 2003, two years later.
