Hey guys,

For the next *two days*, I'm going to be accepting applications for public coaching sessions. If you're interested, here's how it works:

[Note: the window for this has now passed. I'll be posting a follow-up very soon!]

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2cjLoO97elo">[video]</div>

* Write in an application (subject: Application), and just tell me a little bit about what games you're playing and what you suspect your mental weaknesses are.

* I'll accept (probably) three coaching clients. If you're accepted, we'll chat a little beforehand, and then record a 50~ min coaching session where we'll try to diagnose and work through your primary issues. Then, a week later, we'll do a short 15~20 minute followup to track the progress you've made.

* As an added bonus incentive, if you write within the next two days (that is, until 5/15/2014), then I'll send you a **free copy of my audiobook** as well (**$17.95** on [Amazon/Audible](http://www.amazon.com/How-Be-Poker-Player-Philosophy/dp/B00IJHYGOM/ref=tmm_aud_title_0)), just for writing in! Just mention in your e-mail whether you'd like the audiobook (since I know many of you already have it), and for those who want it, I'll ship it your way. :)

* The coaching audio will get thrown up on my website, so that other people who're potentially interested in coaching can get an idea of what it's like. If that sounds like a decent tradeoff for free coaching, then go ahead and write in! If you're going through a downswing or have wanted to get a jump-start improvement on some of your tilt, motivation, focus, or anger issues as a poker player, I encourage you to send one in. :)

So there you go! [You can contact me here, as always.](http://www.haseebq.com/connect/) Just make the subject: &ldquo;Application.&rdquo;

I'll update this once the window for applications is closed. Hopefully the results will be pretty cool once I put them up! You might learn a thing or two about how to solve your own tilt/motivation problems. Look forward to it! :)

[Note: you can't get a free audiobook or apply for this anymore. But I feel like I owe you something&hellip;so please accept this funny video as recompense.]
