You might be wondering what's wrong with these people. Do they have ADHD? Alzheimers? Some obscure degenerative disease? In fact, what they have in common is that they're online multitabling regulars, and their stories provide a chilling glimpse into the murky horizon that awaits many poker players.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JlSsbNc0_u0">[video]</div>

How common are these stories? I first started hearing accounts of it when I was a poker player. I'd even experienced some of it myself. When Pokerstars raised the multitabling limits back in 2007, 12-tabling 6-max games quickly became my bread-and-butter. Before long, playing just four tables would bore me; I didn't have the patience for it. After enough time, reading a book or sitting through a two hour documentary seemed like an ordeal. I'd browse Youtube videos while chatting on Skype and reading poker forums. My brain was continually being fed high-octane stimuli, and when it wasn't, I had trouble focusing.

After quitting poker three years ago, a lot of that had gone away. I'd largely forgotten about it. But when I saw a few threads on TwoPlusTwo with people sharing their stories, it sent me down a rabbit hole of investigation.

## Your Brain on Multitabling

It's impossible to know exactly what poker does to the brain. Poker as it's being played now, multitabled for 500+ hands per hour, is a new and strange phenomenon. There's really never been anything like it. It's been around for less than ten years&mdash;too recent for us to observe its long-term effects. And the scientists who study online gambling are more interested in its effects on addicts and laypeople than its effects on professionals.

We have some anecdotes, but anecdotes don't tell us enough. We don't have a clear picture of what percentage of multitablers this happens to. We assume that online poker is the cause of this, but the causation could be more complex than that. We don't know if these people are simply predisposed toward attentional problems, and perhaps that's what caused them to became multitablers in the first place. Or their problems might be caused by some third independent factor, such as Internet addiction. There are too many confounding variables, so we have to get at the question another way.

## The Price of Multitasking

Picture a 24-tabling regular, staring at two 30&rdquo; monitors peppered with MTTs and sit-and-gos. Decisions pop in front of him and then recede into the background with frenetic speed. He's mentally jumping again and again into different situations, clicking rapidly from game to game.

By constantly switching his mental context, he incurs what neuroscientists call [switching costs](https://www.apa.org/research/action/multitask.aspx). &ldquo;Every time we shift our attention, the brain has to reorient itself, further taxing our mental resources,&rdquo; writes Nicholas Carr. &ldquo;Many studies have shown that switching between just two tasks can add substantially to our cognitive load.&rdquo;

Through switching costs, multitasking almost always decreases our efficiency at any given task. That doesn't come as much of a surprise. But what about for someone who's multitasking day-in and day-out? If you're always multitasking, does that make you more efficient at it? An infamous [2009 Stanford study](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/08/21/0903620106.full.pdf+html) looked at exactly this.

The study compared heavy technology multitaskers against light multitaskers. They expected the multitaskers to outperform the non-multitaskers, but what they found was the exact opposite. The heavy multitaskers were less able to ignore distractions, had worse focus, short-term memory, and were poorer at context switching. According to one of the researchers, the heavy multitaskers were &ldquo;suckers for irrelevancy.&rdquo; &ldquo;Everything distracts them.&rdquo; Notably, these symptoms are similar to what we observed in chronic multitablers.

Usually, the brain adapts to become better at commonly repeated tasks or stimuli. But it seems in this case, the brain's response is maladaptive. Constant multitasking made people's brains *worse* at it. Why?

## The Perils of Overstimulation

Perhaps the high rate of information processing puts so much load on the brain that it weakens other faculties, such as working memory or attention control. It's not implausible. Studies have shown that overstimulation leads to [significant impairments in cognitive function for mice](http://www.nature.com/srep/2012/120731/srep00546/full/srep00546.html). Maybe this is something similar&mdash;perhaps poker players are getting overstimulated, and it's affecting their brainpower.

![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Human_brain.png)

But on the other hand, there are reasons to believe that some multitasking has positive effects on the brain. Studies have shown that complex computer tasks like Internet browsing are powerful mental exercise, and have positive effects on patients with cognitive decline. [One study](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0070350) even introduced non-gamers to Starcraft, the real-time strategy game, and found a significant boost in their cognitive flexibility after a few months. These studies seem to indicate that some amount of multitasking is valuable mental stimulation. So when does brain training become brain overload?

It's hard to say. What's clear is that these multitablers have crossed the threshold into unhealthy multitasking. And chances are, that's not the sole cause of their cognitive impairment. Internet addiction similarly causes impairment of executive control and irritability. According to one study by the University of Melbourne, about 10% of students have Internet addiction. Judging from the accounts given by multitablers, it's likely that massive multitabling and Internet addiction are occuring together and are mutually reinforcing.

## A Trigger-happy Brain

But perhaps the &ldquo;overstimulation&rdquo; model doesn't tell the whole story. After all, it's hard to believe that the brain isn't able to adapt positively to multitasking when it's able to adapt to almost everything else. What if we assume that the brain is adapting positively, but only within a narrow band of behavior? After all, people clearly get better at multitabling over time. The progression is well-known: you have to 9-table before you can 12-table before you can 16-table.

Perhaps the problem is that the multitabler has trained his brain for constant, hair-trigger context switches. By spending so much time in the trenches of multitabling, his brain has become trigger-happy when it comes to switching. This causes many automatic, unwanted context switches. And what's another word for an unwanted context switch? Distraction, of course. In that case, it's no wonder that massive multitablers can't focus. They spend all their time adapting their brain to constant switching, so even if they try to slow down and focus, their brain is still primed to switch at a moment's notice.

Perhaps this best explains these effects on the brain. Or perhaps both this trigger-readiness and overstimulation are to blame. Or perhaps it's something else altogether. So far, we don't know. But either way, it's hard to question that massive multitabling is harmful to our brains.

Dusty &ldquo;Leatherass9&rdquo; Schmidt concluded in his [infamous blog post](http://www.cardplayer.com/poker-blogs/51-dusty-leatherass-schmidt/entries/561296-this-is-my-brain-on-poker) that quitting poker was the only option left to him. But that doesn't mean that all multitablers need take such drastic steps. In fact, a lot of research suggests that there are some ways to buffer against these ailments. In part 2 of this article I'll explore what you can do to inoculate yourself and multitable sustainably&mdash;if I ever write it (I suck, I know).

Until then,

title: Why I've Decided to Devote my Career to Earning-to-Give

---

It's been almost four years now since I retired from professional poker. I haven't played a single hand of poker since then. I've written a lot about poker, I've coached a lot of poker players, but the game itself is long behind me.

So what comes next?

Ever since I quit, that question has hung over me. What do I do with my life? As a poker player it was an easy question: just get better. For a poker player, that means either make more money, or beat stronger opponents. Both are tangible, irrefutable metrics.

I'm not a poker player anymore. But I've realized that no matter how things change, self-mastery is still my life's goal. Perhaps that's why I was so drawn to poker when I was.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j0DvjgagJko">[video]</div>

As I've matured, the meaning of self-mastery changed for me too. To me, self-mastery means mental, physical, and spiritual excellence. It also means ethical excellence. So over the last few years, I've been working to cultivate virtue as best I can. I've been physically training myself through kickboxing, weightlifting, dieting and fasting. I've been mentally and spiritually training myself through minimalism, self-discipline, and meditation. I've volunteered as a dishwasher and done construction work, tutored refugees in English, and over the last year I've volunteered on a domestic violence hotline and been a hospital advocate for sexual assault victims.

I wasn't a poker player because I enjoyed it. In the same way, I don't do these things because I enjoy them either. I do them because I want to move me closer to the kind of person I want to be. It's a struggle that I hope I never abandon.

So what about my career?

I've been kicking around that question for a long time. There's a lot I could do, but what would be the most valuable? For a while I was exploring law school, organizational psychology, and most recently an MBA. But in the past couple months, I've stumbled upon the thing that I know I need to do. And it's altered the course of my life.

**I've decided to become a web developer so that I can earn-to-give.**

## What's Earning-to-give?

It was a few years ago that I first came across the writings of a movement called [Effective Altruism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism). At its simplest, Effective Altruism boils down to one big idea: be altruistic in a way that's rigorous and based on evidence. Rather than simply following your gut or &ldquo;doing what feels right,&rdquo; EA demands that you think seriously about the best ways to improve the world, and to implement those solutions in a rigorous way, no matter how uncomfortable or demanding it might be.

It's more than just thinking about how to do good. It's thinking about how to do *as much good as possible*. And earning-to-give, which came out of Effective Altruism, is one such strategy.

Earning-to-give simply means pursuing a successful career so that you can donate the money you make to the most cost-effective charities. Where some think the best way to help the world is by directly adding their labor (i.e., entering the non-profit job market), someone who earns-to-give thinks they can help even more by earning money in the private sector and donating that money to charitable causes.

That's what I'm going to do. **I'm going to donate 33% of my income for as long as I possibly can. And once I have some savings, I'll raise that number to 50%.**

It sounds outlandish, I know. And on the rare occasion that I confess to someone my plan to do this, their next question is inevitably:

## Why?

It's funny. I was 19 when I first became a millionaire. I had more money than any adolescent ever should. And I had no idea what to do with it. All the insipid little contests poker players would get into on who made more, who was going to retire first, who had a bigger watch, car, house, they held no appeal to me. Money and luxury seemed empty.

In many ways, I'm happier having left it behind.

So why was I so drawn to poker, a game quintessentially about greed? I think it's because I loved the challenge. I wanted to prove myself. I wanted to get better, and to know that I was good.

I still want that. I think self-challenge is a fundamental part of my soul. But I also want to help people as much as I can. And earning-to-give is a way for me to do all of that&mdash;to challenge myself, to develop my skills, while still living an authentic and ethical life. To help people, to change the world, while still mastering myself as a human being.

I don't want to become rich. I don't want to retire young. I want to fight all of my life for the things I care about, and to become a better person for it.

So that's why I'm earning-to-give.

I decided all of this a long time ago, but it's only recently that I've taken the first steps. I'm flying out to San Francisco this Wednesday, and I'll be embarking on my new career path as a web developer. It's a scary, frantic, and exciting time. And it feels like exactly what I should be doing.

**So why web development?** I'm going to explain that in my [next blog post](https://haseebq.com/why-im-becoming-a-web-developer/). For now I need to sleep. I have a lot of preparations I need to make and people I need to say goodbye to.

I'll be writing again soon.

<p class="note">Edit1: someone asked me why I decided to write all this publicly. Two reasons: one, that I believe it's valuable to do this visibly, so that I can potentially influence others to become interested in Effective Altruism and earning-to-give. Second, to hold myself accountable. By publicly tying my hand, I make it harder to go back on this.</p>

<p class="note">I'm committed now.</p>

<p class="note">Edit2: a quote I read earlier today that struck me.</p>

> However many holy words you read, however many you speak, what good will they do you if you do not act on upon them?
> <div class="source">Dhammapada</div>

A new stage in my life began four days ago. I got out of a taxi on 7th and Market Street, with all of my belongings stuffed into a backpack and one suitcase. To my left, homeless men were peddling their wares and accosting passersby, and on my right, I could see the dizzying buildings packed with San Francisco's most promising startups.

I've never lived in a city like this before. Not like San Francisco. I'm frantically trying to figure out this city and the tech industry. To put it simply, I'm lost and excited.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lv0vRHid5cw/">[video]</div>

## How I Got Here

I've known for a while that I wanted to move to the Bay and [earn-to-give](https://80000hours.org/earning-to-give/). So a few months ago, when I got an offer from a good friend of mine to do &ldquo;growth hacking&rdquo; in a few months for an early stage startup in the Bay, I was really interested. Marketing wasn't what I was ultimately passionate about, but it would be a fantastic opportunity to break into the industry and work with some amazing people.

Wanting to brush up my skills (marketing for startups requires lots of technical stuff), I began teaching myself some basic coding: HTML/CSS, Javascript, R.

Much to my surprise, I enjoyed it. A lot. Not only did I enjoy it, but I was good at it. I picked up ideas quickly, relentlessly attacked problems, and reveled in the myopic flow of tinkering and problem-solving. In a way, it reminded me of what I used to enjoy most about poker.

It began to dawn on me that: hey, if I became a coder, I could go into the tech world from the development side. Rather than market things, I could build them myself. And if I wanted to eventually go into entrepreneurship and found my own company, then I could build that product myself. Even from the financial side, as a coder, I could earn-to-give more quickly (since marketing for a startup doesn't pay a whole lot). It all seemed to make perfect sense. Except for one thing: I was 25 and had hardly done any coding in my life. How was I going to get good enough to actually get a job, much less in the technology capital of the world?

## Coding Bootcamps

I began researching coding bootcamps. Coding bootcamps are a new and revolutionary model in technology education. [Bootcamps.in](http://www.bootcamps.in/) describes them as &ldquo;full time coding schools designed to train students without programming skills â€¦ by providing highly focused, accelerated learning programs.&rdquo; Coding bootcamps are extremely structured full-time programs that last around 3 months, and teach students how to code from top to bottom. In the span of just a few months, many learn enough to be competitive with graduates from major CS programs. In other words, it's the hack into quickly becoming a hacker.

I got my hustle on. I made a list of all the best coding bootcamps in the Bay (other than HackReactor, since their start dates were too far away), and applied to every single one of them to start as soon as possible. The next week was a sleepless flurry of teaching myself Ruby and Javascript so that I'd be able to pass these technical interviews. For a week straight, I barely left my room. Code was all I saw and breathed. That might sound awful, but I felt ecstatic. I loved it.

Ten days later, I had five acceptances in hand, including an acceptance at my goal school: [App Academy](http://www.appacademy.io). Alongside HackReactor, it's considered the best coding bootcamp in the world. Their program is 12 weeks of 70+ hours of non-stop coding. It has a 3% acceptance rate, 98% employment, no tuition up front, and an average starting salary in the Bay of 105k. Once I got the call, I celebrated, re-oriented, said goodbye to my old friends and prepared to move to SF.

So that's how I got here. I'm going to become a web developer. Not forever, certainly. But for now, this is what's next.

I'm really f**king excited.

So people have asked me: why web development? Surely there are better ways to make money. I could go back into poker, or go into finance, or even get an MBA.

Those are all reasonable choices, I agree. But I think ultimately, web development is the right choice for me, and I'm going to explain why.

## Why Web Development?

First and foremost, I know that I want to work in the tech industry and in the Bay Area. The culture, the weather, and the ethos of this place have always appealed to me, and have drawn me for most of my life toward that direction. I always knew I'd eventually come here. And who knows if I'll stay, but I know this place is going to be a part of my life.

Second, learning to code is an invaluable skill in and of itself. By getting into this industry I'll be able to survey and understand the landscape of both business and entrepreneurship much better. As a coder, I'll be in a prime position to move in any direction once a promising opportunity presents itself, whether that's working for a tech company, a startup, or an orthogonal industry entirely. It is, in that sense, an extremely versatile credential. Not only that, but it's one I can cash in immediately, unlike one that requires a graduate degree.

I know I'll never be the best computer scientist in the world. That's fine; it's not my goal. I have other advantages that I can leverage in the long run, but I'm going to find opportunities to do that by making my way into the industry.

Third, I find coding very intellectually engaging in a way that I don't marketing, business, or finance. That's no mark against those fields&mdash;each one is complex in its own right. They're just not fields I can get immediately passionate about, and nor are they fields that I can easily penetrate with my hodgepodge credentials. In that sense, coding is supremely meritocratic. Either you can code or you can't, and in the Bay, abilities go a lot further than certifications. I've always appreciated that about poker, and I appreciate that about coding.

Four, going into coding will allow me to earn-to-give immediately, connect with other effective altruists who are in tech, and potentially influence others to get into EA and earn-to-give themselves. Tech seems to attract an ideal profile&mdash;thoughtful nerds who don't have much use for all the money they're making. If I can come out here and do some movement-building for Effective Altruism and earning-to-give, it could lead to an amazing impact. I suspect I could do a lot more here than I could in finance, and certainly more than in being a poker player.

And finally, as a web developer, I'll be able to build shit! It's cool. It's fun. It's an exciting and amazing skill, and one in a market that is (short-term prognoses aside), likely to remain robust, if not grow even bigger. Coding and working with data are skills that will be increasing necessities as our internet-driven society evolves. I'm excited to get involved in that, and bite off a small piece of this giant pie.

And why not poker? Because I made a promise to myself to move on with my life, and that's what I've done. And while maybe I might be able to make money in poker in the short-term, I think in the long-term, this will be a much better investment. And just as importantly, I'll be a lot happier.

So.

To that end, this blog will be changing. I'll still write sometimes about poker, but much of my focus is going to be shifting toward technology, entrepreneurship, and effective altruism. Over time, I'll update the design of the blog to reflect that transition. But for now, I've gotta put my head into the game and focus on coding.

My first class of App Academy starts tomorrow morning. It's 70+ hours of non-stop work for the next few months, so I have a torrent of work ahead of me. Time to start swimming.

It's been two weeks now since I began the coding bootcamp at App Academy. The material has been blasted at us at a breakneck pace, and I've been learning a ton. Among the things I've learned: what &ldquo;90 hours a week&rdquo; feels like. The past 5 days, I've been at App Academy from 10AM till midnight, every single day.

It's strange; it feels like just a few days ago that I first posted that I was going to move out here. But we're already beginning week 3 of the academy. It's all a flurry of building programs and trying not to under-sleep. That said, I've gained more confidence in my abilities as a coder. I'm starting to suspect I really have some potential for this.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5bJ0ldayP24/">[video]</div>

I'm still an acolyte coder. Hell, I'll still be an acolyte when I make it out of this program in 10 weeks. Coding is a mountain, and I'm standing at its base. Even with all this I'll have barely climbed one step. But I like that. That's exhilarating place to be for me.

Almost everyone I meet in San Francisco has some background in tech. And that means almost everyone I meet is further than I am. Everybody has something to teach me. It's an amazing feeling. For most of my life as a poker player, I was the &ldquo;master.&rdquo; For every person I looked up to, there were 100 people looking up to me. It was my job to give answers rather than to find them.

But in coding, it's the other way around. I am a student among students. Almost everybody knows more than I do. The impulse to learn, to get better, is irresistible. There's something absolutely ecstatic about that.

I'm going to keep trying to update this blog, but while I'm at App Academy, most of my writing will probably be constrained to my coding blog I've made. You should read it: I write about my progress through App Academy, talk about the challenges I'm facing, and show the programs I've made.

Everything I've done so far has been pure Ruby (meaning, command-line programs), but they include fully-functioning Tic-Tac-Toe, Hangman, all the way up to Chess, Checkers, and currently working on five-card draw poker! Follow me if you want to ride side-car on my coding adventures.

#### You can find my coding blog here: [http://haseebwritescode.com](http://haseebwritescode.com)

(Don't worry if you're not technical, I'm going to continually do my best to explain things so that they're easy to understand. And you'll probably learn a few cool things along the way!)

Sincerely trying to get enough sleep,

It's officially official.

At week 8 into my 12 week coding bootcamp, I was whisked into a room with Ned Ruggeri, the co-founder of App Academy. He sat me down and told me that I was the top student in my cohort (40~ students), and asked that I come on as an instructor and help teach the bootcamp. With the position comes a competitive package, the opportunity to teach others what I've learned, strengthen my skills as a coder, and the potential to develop future App Academy computer science curriculum.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j1hWXU7vs9Q/">[video]</div>

I accepted the position. I'll be starting in a week and a half, effectively skipping the last 1/4th of the program to begin teaching. I'm really looking forward to this, since I really enjoy teaching, and I've grown increasingly confident in my skills as a coder over the course of this program. If anybody is interested in going down this same route or interested in attending App Academy, I encourage you to contact me! I'd be happy to chat about my experiences. And having gone through (most) of it, I can only endorse App Academy as having aÂ *stellar* curriculum, and being eminently worth the time and monetary investment.

I negotiated a four-and-a-half month contract, after which I'll decide whether I want to stay and continue to work with App Academy, or seek other employment in the tech world. It's going to be an exciting and busy time for me. In a way, it'll also be my first real-actual-job.

Haha, it's notÂ *really* my first job; I've been working in one sense or another since I was probably 17 years old. I just kind of like that idea.

This also means that I'll begin earning-to-give and getting more involved in Effective Altruism. It's funny, hah. That was exactly my plan: through App Academy, I'd be able to earn-to-give almost immediately. I didn't expect that to happen before the program even ended. Anyway, watch this space! Once I start TAing at App Academy, I'll be able to update this blog again more regularly.

(And to everyone who's been supporting me or offering advice, or just watching me as I wind along my journey, I just wanted to give a big thank-you. And I hope you continue to expect big things from me!)

EA Global, the largest ever public gathering of EAs, has left me reflecting on what it means to be an effective altruist.

A few weeks ago, 400+ attendees and prominent EA activists, including Will MacAskill and Nick Bostrom (and Elon Musk!), converged on a Google Campus in Mountain View to discuss the state and direction of the EA movement. I ended up donning a volunteer shirt and helping out&mdash;time-keeping for talks, directing and crowd-control, moving heavy objects (a weakness of many Effective Altruists), and scrambling to save the conference from various minor emergencies.

 It was an exhausting and important weekend, although it didn't feel important at the time.

Increasingly, EA has come to guide the direction of my life. I'm earning-to-give with my career (giving a third of all my earnings to high-impact charities), I'm helping to lead [.impact](&rdquo;dotimpact.im&rdquo;), a global EA volunteer group, and I'm helping run Bay Area effective altruism [workathons.](https://www.facebook.com/events/392649784261768/)

I'm taking an active role in helping effective altruism to grow. And it's growing at a meteoric rate. Since the formalization of the movement in 2011, it's more than doubled every year. Effective altruism is going to be big, and it has the potential to seriously impact the world.

I want to make sure that happens, and to make sure that impact is as big as it can be. For me, it's probably the highest-leverage way that I can change the world.

----

In saying this though, I've glossed over an important question. Why did I become an effective altruist to begin with?

There are two ways to answer that.

The first way is to say that all of the arguments are compelling. EA's critique of conventional altruism is rigorous and persuasive. If you, like me, are committed to moral consistency, it's hard not to be convinced. In a way, effective altruism begins by pulling softly on the threads of your beliefs, and by the time it's done, your moral imperatives look completely different.

Let's call that the ideological answer. It's the first reason why I'm an EA, and maybe someday I'll tell the story how effective altruism changed my mind.

But right now, I want to tell another story. I want to tell the story of why effective altruism changed not my mind, but my life. Why EA makes me do things that I wouldn't otherwise dream of doing&mdash;like devoting my life to it.

It's not because of the arguments or the ideologies. Those things are powerful, but arguments are paltry against all the history and conditioning behind a human life. It takes something more blunt than that to change someone's life. It takes something powerful and human.

Really, it takes a punch to the stomach.

The other night while walking home, I had such a punch.

----

I was at the office exceptionally late.

It was 1AM when I finally summoned the awareness that I ought to go home. I closed up my laptop, grabbed my messenger bag, put in my earphones and began down the stairwell. On the ground floor, the security guard, a weathered and prunish Asian man, was fast asleep in a leather chair. I gently opened and closed the building door behind me and stepped out onto Market Street.

At 1AM on a Tuesday, SoMa is deserted. The crisp, young professionals are nowhere to be seen. Even the homeless, usually selling their wares or arguing on a street corner, are absent. There are only a few scuffed-up bundles here and there, dreaming against the walls of buildings.

I turned the corner onto 5th street. It was silent, illuminated with street lights. Cars occasionally floated past. The night felt so barren, I could have been in any city in the world.

I can't explain it, but it was a scene of almost transcendent beauty. Do you know what I mean when I say that? There was nothing special about the sight of it. It's just that this was the world, undisturbed, and I was, for a moment, its only witness.

How long has it been since I felt completely alone, I wondered? A long time. It's an important feeling&mdash;perhaps the most important feeling of my entire life. Time and time again I return to it, or if I can't find it I go searching for it.

Looking up at the lights, walking down 5th street, hands in my pockets, I was thinking: this is it. This is the world. The only one I'll ever get to experience. I never asked for it, I don't even deserve it, but here it is.

I became aware of a song in my headphones. It was this one:

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MqWVegTsHZA/">[video]</div>

And I then remember: damn, am I lucky.

I'm lucky to be born in a rich country.

I'm lucky to have headphones, to own this messenger bag. To have two strong legs. To not be in a bundle on the side of this street. To not have grown up fighting drugs, or malaria, or theocracy, or a war. I'm lucky. I'm so goddamn lucky, and right now I barely even feel it.

I didn't earn my birth. I didn't earn my intelligence. I didn't earn my privilege, my health, my values, my messenger bag. It may as well have been divvied to me in an ancient, secret coup.

I didn't stop walking. The song was building in my ears.

Billions of humans in this world. And so many lives burdened and stunted by poverty, illness, trauma, war. Billions. Imagine if you could hear the sound of it all at once. That furious ocean of suffering, which is invisible to me because I'm here. Because of how quiet this street is. Because this street has conspired to squelch the sound and magnitude of that ocean.

----

But you see, it's not the suffering that gets me. I can accept suffering. Somewhere, someone will always be suffering, and I know that.

It's just the injustice of it. It's that the injustice is so big, so absolute, it's almost suffocating. It's so much that you can't swallow right. All around the world, billions of lives&mdash;billions, never given any relief, never given a way out of that ocean.

So why me? Why do I get to walk down this street in silence? Why am I the one with a laptop and a messenger bag?

You see, when I think about this, it makes me angry. It makes me fucking outraged. What would you do if you lived in such a world? In a world that conspires against itself, in a world that is arbitrary and unjust?

Would it make you sick? Would it make you want to goddamn do something about it? To start a revolution? To throw up arms against this invisible oppressor?

That's what it does to me.

It makes me the kind of mad that I almost don't care what I do. That I might do anything to fight it. That I might throw my entire life against this injustice, just to do it, just so I can say to myself and to my children that my eyes were open, that I saw that injustice, and I fought against it.

To me, that's the promise of EA.

To me, EA promises: if you want to do good in the world, I will show you the thing that will do the *most* good.

And when the stakes are so high, and when the question is so dire and important, how could you not take up that promise?

So that's what I've decided to do. That's why I became an effective altruist.

Perhaps you'll become one too.

Six months ago I decided I wanted to become a software developer. I had almost no coding background whatsoever, but screw it, I decided to take the leap. I applied to all of the coding bootcamps in San Francisco, and went into a cave to teach myself nothing but code. I ended up getting into my top choice, [App Academy](http://appacademy.io). I was crushing the program as the top student in my cohort. Two months into the three-month program, the founders asked me to come on board and help teach the course. I'm now working as one of App Academy's main instructors.

Students often want to know what led to my success. They also ask me what I might do differently if I were to do it over again. It's funny, because when I was going through this process, it seemed like all of the info out there on coding bootcamps was sparse and contradictory. So I decided to write the guide that I wish *I* had when going through this process. Consider this guide a synthesis of my own experiences and those of many other successful students.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5yYS6D-C3ew/">[video]</div>

**If you want to learn how to totally crush your coding bootcamp and land an awesome job as a software developer, this guide is for you.**

Let's start at the top.

## Step 0: Taking the Leap

#### Before we make any life-altering decisions, let's first consider: is a coding bootcamp the right choice for you?

Taking a coding bootcamp is a serious life commitment. It might sound like a fun and whimsical field trip into the world of programming, but realize: most of these coding bootcamps demand upwards of $15,000 and a full three months of your life, 80+ hours a week. If you decide to do this, you will have to blow through a lot of savings and the next several months of your life will be devoted to the singular task of learning how to code. In no uncertain terms, attending a coding bootcamp is taking a giant bet, with both your money and your time.

Are you ready to do that? Take this question seriously. Don't just nod to yourself&mdash;taking it seriously means honestly entertaining that it might *not* be the right choice.

#### Some reasons to think you shouldn't take a coding bootcamp:

* *You're not certain about coding.* To be clear, coding doesn't need to be your forever thing, but it's definitely gotta be your foreseeable-future thing.

* *You have a lot of demands on your time.* If you want to try to juggle your book club and a cocaine addiction and your Etsy business of hand-sewn Star Wars plushies, I wish you the best. But if you want to have a good chance of surviving, you're probably going to have to live a pretty minimalistic life for a while.

* *You're bad at math or analytical thinking.* This is pretty much the best predictor for who makes good coders. Coding doesn't really require a lot of math, though. It's just that being proficient in math usually means you have the right kind of thinking skills for excelling at programming.

* *You're doing it just because you want to make more money.* Money is a shitty motivator, and it won't sustain you. Do this because you actually want to learn how to code and you might enjoy making this your life.

* *You have weak communication skills.* This one might be counterintuitive. Isn't programming the stereotypical job for people with no communication skills? Au contraire, my friend. That might be true for fresh grads coming out of Berkeley. But you will not be a typical coder. Once you make it out of this bootcamp, you're going to be an oddball programmer with a non-traditional background. That means it's going to be up to you to sell yourself to iployers; your pedigree certainly won't do it for you. Coding bootcamps equip you with the knowledge to excel in a job, but it's 100% up to you to convince a hiring manager that you're a capable, friendly, cooperative person who they'll actually want to have join their team.

But don't let me deflate your balloon too much. Let's also look at the positive side!

#### Reasons to think you might do well in a coding bootcamp:

* *You're dissatisfied with your current job/life situation.*

* *You enjoy thinking analytically and you pick up new things quickly.*

* *You thrive in high-pressure environments.* You manage stress well.

* *You have considerable savings* or know people who are willing to loan you ~8 months of living expenses and/or your tuition fees. (There are a [number of companies](https://www.credible.com/blog/lending-news/student-loan-options-for-coding-bootcamps/) that can help with outside financing though.)

* *You are innately talented at math or logic* (even if you haven't done either in a while).

* *You have done some programming/web development before and enjoyed it.* (optional) Alternatively, you thrive on technical shit.

* *You're a capable typist and generally know your way around a computer.*

I'll assume going forward that you've thought about this, and you're sure this is where you're supposed to be. Let's start applying then.

## Step 1: Getting In

#### First, apply to every bootcamp in the region(s) you're considering.

There are four main reasons why it's crucial to apply to **every** bootcamp.

* The first reason is that it'll give you practice with the interview process. Even if you're dead-set on going to a particular boot camp (as I was), you'll get a lot out of going through multiple funnels simultaneously. Talking about yourself, working on basic coding problems in an interview context&mdash;these will become easier the more times you do it.

* The second reason is that having an acceptance in hand makes you more attractive to other boot camps. Especially if you're applying to all of the boot camps in a region, they'll all be more than happy to poach a student from a competitor. They're also likely to expedite you through their process if you tell them that you need to make a final decision soon.

* The third reason is that it lowers the stakes. Psychologically speaking, you're going to be less anxious and freaked out if your top choice interview is just one among the many interviews you're doing. Again, even if you're dead-set on going to only one or two of those schools, just having the illusion of fall-back options will trick your brain into calming the hell down. Every little bit helps.

* And lastly, do it because it's easy. Most of the applications are essentially the same, and none of them cost any money. So there's pretty much no downside to it.

#### A Breakdown of Coding Bootcamps in the Bay Area (skip if you're elsewhere)

App Academy, HackBright (women-only), and Dev Bootcamp are Ruby schools. (HackBright is technically Python, but Ruby is very similar to Python, and I believe they're willing to conduct your interview in Ruby). HackReactor and MakerSquare are pure JavaScript (MakerSquare was acquired by HackReactor, so these two schools now have a common application process). There are more schools, but the rest of them are far worse than these. Go ahead and apply to other schools too though, for the reasons stated above.

HackReactor and MakerSquare will require you to do all of your interviews in JS. The other schools are generally more flexible.

The general hierarchy of coding bootcamps looks something like this (take with a grain of salt): App Academy â‰ˆ Hack Reactor â‰ˆ Full Stack Academy &gt; HackBright &gt; Flat Iron School &gt; Dev Bootcamp &gt; Everyone else. So I'd start the application process for the weaker schools first, and move my way up the hierarchy so that by the time I get to a top school's interview, I've already banged out a few of the easier ones.

I'll assume that you, like me, have no real coding background and have to decide which language to learn first. There are a lot of tradeoffs here. You could learn JavaScript, which is required for HackReactor's application process. But this has two downsides: JS is significantly harder to learn as your first language compared to Ruby (it's more confusing, verbose, and syntactically unforgiving). The second downside is that HackReactor requires the most preparation of all of the schools to make it through their application process, and it also has the most backed up start dates.

Given that, I decided to learn Ruby first. This allowed me to finish the application process for App Academy, Dev Bootcamp, and General Assembly (as well as a couple other schools) much faster, and get a swifter introduction to programming. I figured if I didn't do well enough on my first batch of applications, then I'd learn JavaScript afterward and apply to the JS schools. That ended up not being necessary, but it's still the strategy I'd advocate now.

App Academy was my number one choice due to their tuition-free model. Most of these other schools make you pay 15-18k in cash up front, while App Academy only requires a small deposit and then takes 18% of your first year's income *if* you land a software development job. If you end up leaving the program or not landing a software engineering job, they refund your deposit and you basically lose nothing. In short, they're the one school that you can kind of take &ldquo;risk-free,&rdquo; because their business model is to literally make a bet on your success. That coupled with their stellar placement stats (97% employment rate, 105k average salary in the Bay Area) made them the clear top choice for me. But your priorities might look different.

The remainder of my advice will assume that you'll be studying Ruby, but all of this advice will be completely applicable if you're studying JS as well.

#### Learning the Basics of Coding

Start with [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com). Work through their entire Ruby track. Don't waste your time learning HTML/CSS or any web development stuff (like Rails); that's all totally irrelevant until you actually get into a coding bootcamp. In your interviews you will only be considered on the basis of your programming ability, not your web development abilities, so the rest can wait. HTML/CSS is pretty easy once you have the rest down anyway.

Your time on Codecademy will serve as a litmus test. Was it kinda fun? Did you pick it up quickly, or was it like pulling teeth? If you're in the former camp, you're in good shape and this might work out well. If it was a significantly uphill struggle or you didn't really enjoy it, then it might be a sign that you should turn back. Take this signal seriously.

Once you finish Codecademy, I'd start sending out your first applications to all but the top schools. Note, coding school applications move *fast*. Aside from scheduling issues, most decisions are made within a few days to a week. It's nothing like applying to traditional schools. So once you apply, the train starts moving! (You can slow it down if you need to though; just tell them that something came up and you need to delay your next step. No one really minds if you do that.)

Now it's time to start working on proper coding problems. App Academy has some [prep work](http://prepwork.appacademy.io/coding-test-1/) that you can do to get yourself up to speed on basic Ruby. It goes over a basic introduction to programming, which should reinforce what you learned at Codecademy. There's also a set of coding problems that you can work on using [Cloud9](http://c9.io) as an online development environment. App Academy provides [detailed instructions](http://prepwork.appacademy.io/coding-test-1/setup) on how to get this set up.

Work through all of these coding problems. You want to be able to do all of these. It's okay if they take you a long time the first time; any problem that took you an exorbitant amount of time, wrap back around and redo them again. You should be able to get each of these problems in

**Some programming tips early on**: make sure to respect proper indentation. Any looping constructs (while loops, for loops, each loops) require a new level of identation. Any &ldquo;end&rdquo; statement should be de-indented. The body of a function must also be indented. Bad indentation habits is one of the easiest ways to slip up early on: you think you ended a function or a loop when you actually haven't. Get used to making your indentation perfect, both because people will count it against you if you don't, and it'll make you much less likely to make simple mistakes. Other common gotchas include: forgetting to increment your iterator (specifically in while loops) and off-by-one-errors.

Once you've finished all those coding problems, you're ready to apply anywhere. Send in your application to App Academy or whatever your top school is.

You'll now want to start working on more advanced programming problems so you can pass your later-stage interviews. App Academy will give access to a second set of coding problems to work on after your first coding test (which you should have done by now). You should complete the second set of coding problems with the same rigor as with the first batch. Once you finish those, you should now be confident enough in your coding skills to grapple with a wider range of programming problems. Let's start getting serious now.

Get on [Coderbyte](http://coderbyte.com/CodingArea/Challenges/). Do *all* of the Easy and Medium difficulty problems. Their interface is a little crappy and buggy, so I'd recommend using [repl.it](http://repl.it) (set the language to Ruby) to work through the problems.

(A micro-primer on [repl.it](http://repl.it): the left side can be used as a text editor, which you can load into the interactive terminal on the right side by pressing the play button. Basically, write methods or define classes on the left side, click the play button, and then call those methods in the terminal on the right side to view their output. It makes for a pretty nice coding scratchpad.)

Once you're done with Coderbyte, you should probably be ready for your final interview. If you have more free time, go back over all of the problems you've previously solved and solve them again. You can also skip below and do some Codewars if you want to improve your skills further.

Eventually, you'll schedule your final interview. Standard mental game advice applies: get a good night's sleep (force it if you have to&mdash;take some [melatonin](wikipedia.org/wiki/melatonin)), do some low-intensity exercise ~30 minutes before your interview (some jogging or jumping jacks are usually good), and then spend the time immediately before your interview doing breathing exercises/meditation.

Remember, when it comes to your performance on the interview, the marginal hour spent studying will be way less valuable than the marginal hour spent sleeping. Get plenty of sleep.

Then do your interview. Nail it.

Now you're in. Holy shit. Now celebrate.

## Step 2: Pre-work

You're in now. If you haven't quit your job yet, do it now. You'll want to devote all of your time to coding and preparing to live in a new(?) city.

You should have a decent gap until your start date. For App Academy, you'll have a lot of prep work to do. This prep work is really important, so allocate enough time to get it done!

But if you have the bandwidth and want to really crush the course, I'd advocate honing your skills further. Get onto [Codewars](http://codewars.com). Codewars was pretty much my secret weapon coming into App Academy. It's what I claim made me, hands-down, the strongest programmer coming into my class. And I'll explain to you exactly how I used it to accelerate my learning.

Given that I've worked as a mental coach for several years, I know a shit-ton about the psychology of learning. And from a learning perspective, Codewars is the best platform out of any of the ones I found (and there are a bunch: HackerRank, Codility, CodeEval).

Codewars works through a ranking system. Each problem on Codewars is ranked from 8 Kyu (easy) to 1 Kyu (extremely hard). You have an overall skill level, starting at 8 Kyu and working your way up. You gain points and rank up by solving coding problems that other users created. Each problem has its own test suite that you must pass in order to win points. But if you look at the solutions without solving the problem, you forfeit any possibility of winning points off that problem.

The key to Codewars is that every solution gets voted on Reddit-style, which makes the very best solutions bubble up to the top. This allows you to solve the problem, then see the *best way to solve the problem*. This will usually teach you some new techniques or functions in the standard library.

So here's what your workflow should look like: find a problem, and try to solve it ([repl.it](repl.it) is often your friend here). If you can't solve it within 30 minutes, then just look at the solution. Whether you solve it or not, read the best solution and try to parse it. It will often be kind of mysterious and use methods that you don't know. Go look up those methods in the documentation, play around with them, make sure you understand what they do and why the solution works. Make sure you get it.

This next step is essential. **Now do the problem again and try to re-implement the ideal solution that you just read. Do it from memory.** If you forget, go back and look at the solution, and then start over. DON'T SKIP THIS STEP FOR ANY PROBLEM, NO MATTER HOW SMALL.

If you do this, you will become a killer. I promise. I did it, and coming into my program I was way ahead of anyone in my mastery over Ruby. I also advocated this approach to my best friend, a former paramedic with no coding experience whatsoever. When the TAs read his coding test, they told me &ldquo;your friend is a beast. No wonder, I guess.&rdquo;

This method works for several reasons.

1) It ruthlessly trains you in the art of solving problems. If you want to get better at solving coding problems, the best way to do it is just *solving lots of coding problems*. Most of solving these problems is just pattern-recognition anyway, and it builds up a lot of exposure to many different problem patterns.

2) It teaches you tons of methods in the standard library, and makes you use them and grapple with them. This imprints them on your unconscious mind stronger than just reading docs or groping through tutorials.

3) By typing out the best solutions from memory, it'll teach you by hand to write good code style and intelligent, concise techniques. Don't underestimate the power of visceral learning. Just by typing out the code that someone else came up with, you'll absorb the learning through your fingers.

If you do this, by the time you enter your program, you'll be a programming wizard. Take my word for it.

I'd also recommend trying to get as far as possible through [Ruby Monk](http://rubymonk.com) to really solidify your knowledge on the inner-workings of Ruby. I'd say it's less important than Codewars, but if you have the time, intersperse Codewars with some Ruby Monk and try to finish all four of its tracks (though the first one you can probably skip at this point). Ruby Monk will solidify your knowledge on the internals of the language, while Codewars will transform you into a problem-solving machine.

Now finish your prep work and get ready for life in a new city!

Next time, we'll pick up once the program begins, in Step 3, and see how to excel in your course. Watch this space!

2015 has come to a close and I've just finished my first year's donations. In all I gave 33% of my pre-tax income, which since I started my job in June, amounts to $21,200 USD I donated to high-impact charities.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HyMfMYRpHUg">[video]</div>

## Donations

I donated *$5,300* to AMF, the *[Against Malaria Foundation](https://www.againstmalaria.com/)*, which distributes low-cost anti-mosquito bednets in parts of Africa that are ravaged by malaria. AMF is ranked by [Givewell](http://givewell.org) as the most marginally impactful charity in the world.

![](http://www.goodventures.org/images/grants/against-malaria-general-support-2012.gif)

----

I gave another *$5,300* to [*.impact*](http://dotimpact.im), a grassroots EA organization with which I've grown more involved over the last year. .impact is best known for creating a ton of EA infrastructure, including the [EA Forums](http://effective-altruism.com) and [EA Hub](http://effectivealtruismhub.com). Their latest project is LEAN, which helps to seed and support EA chapters all around the world, helping to foster the movement at the grassroots level.

![](http://dotimpact.im/assets/dotimpactlogo-new-ozzie.png)

----

I gave the remainder, *$10,600* to the [*Center for Effective Altruism*](http://centreforeffectivealtruism.org), specifically to the [EA Outreach team](https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/winter-fundraiser-2015/ea-outreach), which is run by Kerry Vaughan and Tyler Alterman. EA Outreach was responsible for [EA Global](http://eaglobal.org/), the major EA conference this year at Google HQ, and have ambitious plans on how to grow the movement and influence more of the world toward evidence-based giving. I think the impact they could have is enormous, and so I decided to give them half of my donations this year.

![](3 of my nominal income. I haven't been able to put much aside for savings, but I'm at least saving a little. The cost of living in SF is pretty steep, so I feel like I've kept my spending respectably low.

## My First Year in Tech

It's pretty crazy how far I've come in this time. I still remember when I first moved into my tiny shared bedroom in San Francisco back in April. I had no idea what to expect. I definitely didn't imagine that I'd get this far in less than a year.

After I matriculated into App Academy, I worked my ass off to learn programming. I was routinely the last person to leave the office, working from 9AM till midnight or later, 7 days a week. Despite how hard it was, it was invigorating to have such focus again.

I quickly rose to the top of my class. At the end of the first 8 weeks of the 12-week course, the founders whisked me into a room and asked me to join the instructional team. I accepted the offer. June 1st, I began my career in tech teaching at App Academy, the coding school I'd just attended. I'd also already begun earning-to-give, a mere two months after coming out here.

To my chagrin, I was immediately placed on a special project working alongside CTO and co-founder of the company, Ned Ruggeri (a Google alum). He put me in charge of all programming work for App Academy's back-end applicant tracking system and the internal tools for our marketing and admissions team.

I soon began giving lectures. Every lecture is rated by the students and tracked for performance. My lectures won the highest rating among all of the teaching staff. Thanks to my performance and the CTO's trust in me, he handed me the entire algorithms curriculum&mdash;a 15-day series of 2-hour lectures covering all of the most important data structures and algorithms in computer science. I was the first person in the history of the company since the CTO to deliver these lectures.

Then in August&mdash;four months ago, three months after App Academy first hired me&mdash;the CEO asked me to stay on permanently. He offered me the title of Head Instructor. I declined. I told them I wanted to help build the company rather than work in instruction. I already knew how to teach, but I wanted to contribute to the business at a deeper level. After some negotiation, I accepted the position of Director of Product for App Academy.

I didn't write about it on my blog because I've barely had the time, but it's a pretty awesome role. Along with writing some of the curriculum and occasionally lecturing, I work alongside the CEO to develop new products, establish partnerships, lead the revenue strategy, and grow the company. I also manage all of the engineering on App Academy's back-end (including our recent website re-design), as well as the new products we currently have in the pipeline. I also just generally do executive stuff and help keep the company running effectively.

It's been a pretty amazing year. I would never have expected to be where I am now when all of this began. I'm growing really rapidly.

But I think 2016 is going to be even more amazing.

Here's to a new year. Here's to changing the world. Here's to staying hungry and learning like crazy.

A couple weeks ago I had my last day as Director of Product at App Academy. This coming Monday, I will be starting work as a software engineer at Airbnb.

Here's the story of why I left App Academy, the tribulations of my ensuing job search, and why I decided to join Airbnb.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sYT_6yGY6LM/">[video]</div>

<div class="note">
<p>Disclaimer: in this blog post and the next, I'll be speaking frankly about compensation packages I received from (larger) companies. I do this for two reasons.</p>

<p>First, because I believe companies often have an unfair informational advantage over candidates, and providing some transparency helps to level the playing field and shift power toward candidates. Second, because as someone <a href="https://haseebq.com/why-ive-decided-to-devote-my-career-to-earning-to-give/">earning-to-give</a>, I already intend to write publicly about my compensation. My hope is that this transparency encourages others to give more. It also pre-commits me to my own intended donations.</p>

<p>My small caveat is that I won't mention the compensation packages from very small (&lt;25 person) startups, which includes App Academy. At very early stage companies, I suspect making compensation packages public is more likely to disrupt a company's operations than to equip candidates with useful data.</p>
</div>

## Leaving App Academy

As Director of Product at App Academy, my role was an amalgam of various responsibilities. I worked with the CEO to help shape the direction of the company, I established new programs and partnerships, I developed new educational products, I wrote curriculum, I worked one-on-one to teach students, I gave many of our CS-heavy lectures, and I contributed to our internal software engineering projects. Needless to say, I wore many different hats and learned a tremendous amount.

But it was around Christmas when I realized that my role was drifting away from software and computer science, and more toward the business side of running a coding school. I was originally attracted to the role because I wanted to immerse myself in a combination of product and engineering/CS. But predominantly, my time was getting monopolized by business and operational tasks.

I wasn't learning as much anymore. The engineering and computer science topics that really interested me were largely orthogonal to App Academy's bottom line. So more and more of my free time I spent reading and thinking about things that were happening at other companies.

Since back in my poker days, I've always had the instinct to seek the company of people who knew more than me. That relentless osmosis is part and parcel of how I quickly became a strong poker player. I'd arrived in the Bay Area not even a year ago, and already I was often the most knowledgeable person in the room.

The conclusion should've been obvious. I was in the wrong room.

I voiced my concerns with Kush and Ned, the founders of App Academy. As much as I loved working with them, after some deliberation, it was clear to me that it was time to move on from App Academy.

The question was, to where?

## Preparing for my Job Search

I had never done an actual job search before. Because I had been hired directly by App Academy after completing the program, I didn't have a solid resume or any projects to speak of.

So, in the free time I had available to me on evenings and weekends, I began beefing up my portfolio. First, I built out my Asteroids game, getting it presentable and fully playable. ([Check it out](http://haseeb-qureshi.github.io/Asteroids/)! It's pretty fun and fully developed now.)

![](https://github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/Asteroids/raw/master/assets/asteroids.gif)

Second, I made a brand new project, heavier on computer science and built in React, to show off my knowledge of front-end development. This project took quite a while to get off the ground, but the process was very satisfying.

Basically, I built an interface that would visually demonstrate local search algorithms solving the 8-queens problem.

[The 8-queens problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) is a classic puzzle of how to arrange 8 queens on a chess board so that none of the queens threaten one another (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). On an 8Ã—8 board, out of 4,426,165,368 possible configurations, only 92 configurations satisfy the puzzle. This makes it prime candidate for a local search or constraint satisfaction problem.

It's pretty fascinating! Many of the best algorithms to solve this problem involve randomization, including iterative repair, which is by far the fastest algorithm I found. [Give it a spin!](http://haseeb-qureshi.github.io/n-queens-visualizer/)

Having wrapped up my projects, I spent the majority of my free time grinding on algorithms problems and strengthening my knowledge of system design. Before long, I was prepped for the interview circuit.

It was time to start the job hunt.

## The Hunt

I started sending out applications. The standard App Academy advice is to blast out crap-loads of applications. All junior resumes get a low base rate of responses, so the best way to maximize your chances of finding a good mutual fit is to apply widely and aggressively. Basically, treat it as a numbers game.

Yet given my success at App Academy and having been paid to do software engineering, I figured that I'd be a much stronger candidate than the marginal App Academy student. Despite the fact that I was working full time and it wouldn't be easy to send out applications en masse, I was confident I'd be fine.

I couldn't've been more wrong.

Of the 20+ applications I sent, I was rejected from every single one without so much as a technical screen. One recruiter from Udacity did actually get on the phone with me&mdash;I had pointed out a CSS error on their website in my application and uploaded a private Youtube video showing them how to fix it. The recruiter thanked me and we joked about it, only for him to later tell me they weren't looking for anyone with my skillset. Again, without even a technical screen.

I started to worry. Was I just completely unsellable? Was my background just too all over the place to be worth anything as an engineer?

My resume was a hodgepodge, no doubt. Professional poker player to mental coach to author to programming instructor to Director of Product, with a degree in English from the University of Texas. Maybe my resume was automatically getting binned everywhere it landed.

Or perhaps, and more likely, the problem was that I was trying to get in through the wrong door. I'm reminded of a quote I recently read by Alex Banayan:

> All highly successful people treat life, business, and success just like a nightclub. There are always three ways in.
>
> There's the First Door, where 99% of people wait in line, hoping to get in.
>
> There's the Second Door, where billionaires and royalty slip through.
>
> **But then there is always, always&hellip;the Third Door.** It's the entrance where you have to jump out of line, run down the alley, climb over the dumpster, bang on the door a hundred times, crack open the window, and sneak through the kitchen. But there's always a way in.
>
> Whether it's how Bill Gates sold his first piece of software, or how Steven Spielberg became the youngest director at a major studio in Hollywoodâ€Š&mdash;â€Šthey all took the Third Door.

Almost everything in my life I've been successful at, I've gotten in through that third door. Becoming a world-class poker player under the age of 18, learning how to code and getting into coding bootcamps in a single frenzied week, or getting hired into App Academy straight as a student and three months later rising up to become Director of Product and teaching their entire algorithms curriculum.

Perhaps this was another case of needing to find that Third Door.

I began plumbing my network. I had one big advantage I hadn't yet leveraged: the students I'd taught. Many of them were working at very strong companies, though they were mostly very junior. At least with their referrals, I'd be able to crack open that window.

Every student I asked was more than excited to refer me. Finally, I had fast-tracked myself into the processes at several awesome companies: Shift, FutureAdvisor, PagerDuty, and Twilio.

I was rejected at all of them. Again, without even a technical screen.

By now I was panicking. But somehow, through the flurry of rejections, a referral from a classmate of mine who was working at 23AndMe came through. He had paired with me during our cohort and spoke very highly of me, so they scheduled me for a technical phone screen.

I was nervous, but once I got on the phone and got rolling on some concrete questions, I crushed everything my interviewer asked me. He was blown away. He told me he'd never heard as thorough of a technical analysis on this problem before, and immediately invited me to do an onsite at their headquarters in Mountain View.

I killed the onsite. And when I say killed, I mean murdered with such ruthless brutality that my children's children will carry the sin with them. To this day, it's the onsite that I felt most confident in. I remember pacing back and forth at the CalTrain station as I awaited my train back to San Francisco, savoring how masterfully I deconstructed each and every question they posed to me. It seemed like everyone who'd interviewed me was ebullient at how quickly and rigorously I'd answered all their questions.

Finally, it seemed like I'd cracked the code.

A week and a half later I open my inbox, and there fresh and white, a reply from my 23AndMe recruiter. The subject: 23AndMe. I open it up to read:

> &ldquo;Thank you for your patience and your time to meet with our SWE team. We appreciate the opportunity to consider you for employment with 23andMe. I want to update you on our search and let you know at this time we are moving ahead with another candidate.&rdquo;

###  To be Continuedâ€¦

(This is getting pretty long, so I'll finish up the second part in a day or two.)

<p class="note">(Note: this is the second part of this story. <a href="https://haseebq.com/farewell-app-academy-hello-airbnb-part-i/">You can read the first part here.</a>)</p>

Despite the rejection from 23AndMe, I kept pushing.

I applied to the all the big hiring websites. [Hired](https://hired.com) rejected me from their platform. I got no bites anywhere on [AngelList](https://angel.co) or LinkedIn&mdash;not even cold e-mails from recruiters. Nothing from [WhiteTruffle](https://whitetruffle.com) or [SmartHires](https://www.smarthires.io).

Not a breath of interest anywhere.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7cA0mwsfpVE/">[video]</div>

I kept on. I asked friends, students, anyone I knew for referrals. I started reaching out to non-engineers. I asked anyone at all who worked at all at a tech company I found compelling.

I was nervous. Was I a fraud? At App Academy I might have seemed like a paragon, but to the rest of the world&hellip;was I simply not good enough?

## A Swing of the Pendulum

In the middle of this flurry, I created an account on TripleByte. [TripleByte](https://triplebyte.com) is a young YC startup that's trying to change tech hiring. From [their manifesto](https://triplebyte.com/manifesto):

> Credentials should not be used as a proxy for talent. Education and work history are meaningful but relying solely on them results in missing good programmers. Good programmers come from all types of background. It's what you can do that matters, not where you went to school.

Their interview process is completely blind to credentials. They decide to work with you purely on the basis of a technical assessment, then they learn about your credentials and then introduce you to startups they determine are a good match. Though they mostly work with experienced software engineers, I decided to give them a try.

To my surprise, I was able to pass their anonymous programming quiz and I was automatically invited to an onsite assessment. I showed up sheepishly to their office on King Street, and over an intense three hours I was grilled by my interviewer on coding, data structures, algorithms, and system design. At the end of the interview, he asked me what my computer science background was. None, I told him. I'd learned this stuff on my own and from teaching at App Academy. He was taken aback, and told me I was incredibly strong for only having studied this material less than a year.

The next day, TripleByte called me. They wanted to work with me! They'd introduce me directly to startups in the YC network. This was exciting&mdash;there were a ton of companies in YC network I wanted to talk to: Stripe, Twitch, Airbnb, to name a few.

Well, as it turned out, those companies weren't really looking for someone like me. Since TripleByte is a two-sided process, they matched me up with companies for which there was a good mutual fit&mdash;Stripe, Twitch, or Airbnb were nowhere on that list. However, one of the companies they matched me with was Gusto, formerly Zenpayroll (and now a timely Zenefits competitor). I'd previously had my eye on them, so I was excited to see them matched up with me. They also lined up an onsite at a small YC startup called Flexport.

TripleByte had gotten things moving. But even more importantly, they had given me back some confidence. TripleByte wanting to work with me was a small affirmation, to be sure&mdash;it wasn't even a job offer yet. But it felt like I'd finally pierced the membrane. If these guys thought I was good&hellip;I must have it. I just gotta prove that to everyone else now.

## Onsites and Offers

I set off to the onsites. The first of the two, Flexport, was a freight company. In many ways, it seemed more like a logistics company than it was about technology company. But I felt like I performed well in the onsite.

A couple days later: no offer.

I was supposed to be upset, but by now this was an old game. I brushed it off. Each interview I could feel was making me better at interviewing. It was getting easier and easier to relax, to ask for what I needed, to make jokes, to grill my interviewers. I was getting into my rhythm now.

Rejected? It is what it is. Just keep putting in the practice, I told myself.

Next was Gusto. They were a groovy company (no shoes in the office!), and the interview was a delight. They told me they'd get back to me within a week.

Shortly afterward, an onsite from Yelp pulled through (my referral was through a non-engineer!). I went onsite and completely rocked it. Every interviewer was clearly impressed, and they immediately asked me for my references afterward. Perhaps things were looking up! It seemed like one of Gusto or Yelp might actually convert into an offer.

All the while, I kept putting more irons in the grill (gotta keep that kitchen running), and kept studying up on algorithms and system design. Around then, I got an e-mail in my inbox from TripleByte:

> Saw you're starting to get some interviews booked with companies!
>
> I actually wanted to throw another company option into the mix, us :) We're hiring to build out our engineering team, we really enjoyed meeting you and would love to talk more about that if its of interest. Just let me know and I can give you a call tomorrow!

Shit. Really?

I hadn't considered joining a super small company. I'd already spent the last year at a 25 person startup; TripleByte was only 5 people. But I knew entrepreneurship was somewhere in my future, and eventually I'd be joining a super early stage startup (if not founding it myself). TripleByte was a fantastic company, already with huge traction in the tech hiring space. Their founder, Harj Taggar, was a former YC partner, and one of the most charismatic and capable people I've met.

They wanted me. A company actually wanted me! A good one! I laugh now, but it was a revelation to me. They invited me in for another onsite so the rest of the team could vet me.

Before I could savor it too long, I received a phone call soon after. Yelp recruiter. Yelp wanted to make an offer.

And with that, the first domino fell.

----

Then came the Gusto recruiter. Gusto wanted to make an offer.

A TripleByte offer came soon in tow. First I had nothing, now I had three offers in front of me.

And yet, it was a little bittersweet. Yelp's offer was 105K salary with ~17K/yr in equity. Gusto hit around 115K with comparable equity in options, and TripleByte was in the same ballpark.

Now, if you're outside tech (or the Bay Area), those might sound like knock-down amazing offers. But all of these offers were lower than I was currently making, and they were all for explicitly junior roles.

Still, 105K might sound like a lot of money to be miffed about. But in San Francisco, with the second highest cost of living in the US (behind only Manhattan), the purchasing power of $105K in SF is the same as making about $57K in Austin, Texas. I also still owed App Academy tuition (18% of my first year's salary), which was deferred because of my employment by App Academy. That 18% would come due on whatever offer I accepted. And of course on top of that, I'd also be donating a third of my income.

But really, what stuck out most to me is that I'd be leaving App Academy to a downgrade. I would be no better off than if I'd just joined those companies a year before. My goal, somewhere in my head, was to make at least more than I was making now. An arbitrary benchmark in a lot of ways, but it was hard to give up.

Was what I'd learned over the last year working at App Academy not worth anything on the market?

Maybe not. Perhaps I just had to accept it.

----

Now that I had offers in hand, it was time to turn the crank. I reached out to every company I was talking to and told them I'd just received several offers, but was very much interested in moving forward. With that, suddenly recruiters started tripping over themselves to get me on site. I was no longer the ugly boy at the party.

I started mowing down onsites. My performance and experience were no different, yet I was treated completely differently. Phone screen from Google. Gusto raised their offer. Phone screen from Stripe. Yelp raised their offer. TripleByte raised their offer. Then the phone screen at Google converted to onsite.

Bam. Suddenly Google was in sight. I felt like Captain Ahab: for me, Google was the Big One.

My Google recruiter worked for the Youtube team (headquartered in San Bruno). That meant if I were to receive an offer, the Youtube team would have first dibs on me. The interview process is standardized Google-wide though, and Google would ultimately be my employer. I spent the weekend before practicing and took the day off from work so I could head down to San Bruno for the interview.

I arrived that morning at the San Bruno BART stop, hardly having gotten any sleep the night before, and walked 30 minutes to the Youtube campus in downtown San Bruno. It was still early, so I sat in the lobby and read over my notes from Cracking the Coding Interview for some thirty minutes, trying to keep my cool. Finally, the recruiter came out and met me and brought me to the interview room.

Unequivocally, Google was the toughest and most nerve-wracking interview I've ever done. The problems were complex and challenging, all abstract and extremely algorithms-heavy. They didn't ask me a single thing about architecture, systems design, web development&mdash;all they cared was that I could solve hard abstract computer science problems. All the interviewers&mdash;clearly brilliant (and all older white men)&mdash;were stony and tight-lipped about my performance.

I walked back to the BART station that evening, exhausted and completely drained, without any idea whether I'd done well or bombed.

A week later, I got a phone call from the Google recruiter.

I was in. Google wanted me.

----

Their offer was reasonably strong&mdash;120K salary with a 15% guaranteed end-of-year bonus and 24K/yr in RSUs. The total package came out to 162K/yr annualized&mdash;much stronger than my other offers, but around the ballpark of what fresh graduates of App Academy who landed at Google would earn. In other words, it seemed they didn't place me very high on their spectrum. But whatever, right? It was Google! I got Google!

With that, the floodgates opened. Just the whiff of the Google name got recruiters into a frenzy. Companies that wouldn't even look at me now bent over backwards to expedite me through their funnels.

Stripe onsite. Uber phone screen. Twitch phone screen. Uber onsite. Stripe offer. Twitch onsite. Uber offer. Twitch offer. The offers came in, stronger and stronger. All the irons I'd put in the fire were now going off like Roman candles.

Which left me with the question of: well, shit, what do I do with them?

## Deciding Factors

As the offers came in, I weighed them seriously. Every single company I talked to was compelling and had aspects that made me want to work there.

But in the end, it was hard to argue against Google being the best choice.

The first and most visceral reason was I'd never have to deal with this BS again. Google would be a golden mark on my resume&mdash;like the Harvard of software engineering. Never again would I have to worry about credentials, or people tossing my resume without reading it. Google is the one name I'd be able to brandish anywhere as *undeniable* proof of my legitimacy as an engineer.

Part of it had to do with my ego, no doubt. But this job search had shown me that part of it was very real and material.

Of course, then there was the compensation. Google would be hard to beat. Like Yelp, Google was a mature public company, so its equity compensation was as solid as cash. That liquidity is an important factor when it comes to earning-to-give&mdash;it means I can [give sooner](https://80000hours.org/2012/04/the-haste-consideration), which has compounding positive impact and flow-through effects.

On top of that, Google was the only company to do a donation matching program, up to $6,000. That's an extra $6,000 a year that goes to charity that otherwise wouldn't. When it came to earning-to-give and building my career, when I looked at the numbers, it seemed clear I couldn't justify choosing any company other than Google.

At that point, it seemed like a done deal. Companies like Uber, Twitch, Stripe, TripleByte, were all awesome companies. But it had to be Google.

Google! I was on cloud nine. I was ready for everything to wrap up as I figured out which bus I would be taking to San Bruno, planned out my morning workout regimen, and all the rest.

But the irons in the fire were still shooting off sparks. Offers improved, sometimes without any prompting on my part. They became increasingly stronger and stronger. Soon, they started overtaking Google's.

I hadn't negotiated with Google at all, so I knew the Google offer would move upward. I expected Google to settle somewhere around 180K all-in, which would be a healthy jump upward. But I started to really think: what would it take for me to turn down Google?

It was a tough question. Because I was in a competitive situation, Google had allowed me to start chatting with Youtube hiring managers and essentially pick my team.

I was offered a spot on the Youtube Red team, doing back-end work in C++. A small and fast-moving team in one of Youtube's shiniest new projects. It would be tough, certainly, to learn the technology and start becoming productive. But I'd be doing world-class engineering, and have a world-class company on my resume.

And yet, I couldn't deny: there was something energetically captivating about each and every startup I talked to. There was something deeper about them that attracted me, something was missing from Google. Not just the growth and the responsibility, or the greater self-determination. Each of these companies were innovators, creating new value in an uncertain future, and&mdash;they needed my help.

They actually needed my help. That was captivating. And it was hard to ignore that I didn't really feel that in my interactions with Google.

But Google continually assured me that they'd be able to beat any other startup's offers. It seemed like a decision they were happy to make for me. As other companies kept bidding up, the Google offer moved up to 185K. And as I was moving into final negotiations, they assured me there was still more room for the offer to grow.

More room to grow? How bad did Google actually want me?

## Enter Airbnb

It's funny. I had initially been rejected by an Airbnb recruiter for a different position more than a month before. Airbnb wasn't even on my radar. So when Ned, the CTO of App Academy told me he'd put me in touch with his friend David at Airbnb, I mostly brushed it off.

Upon Ned's glowing recommendation, David met with me and agreed to refer me into Airbnb. With his referral, I was promptly un-rejected. David was a senior engineer there, and his recommendation seemed to carry a lot of clout (the Google offer helped of course), so I was quickly shuffled through to the phone screen.

I wasn't expecting to do too well&mdash;I'd read in many places that Airbnb had an extremely challenging interview, and that they were more credentials-focused than other companies. So much so that I'd never heard of a bootcamp student getting placed at Airbnb. Apparently they used to post on their job listings: &ldquo;no bootcampers, please.&rdquo;

On the phone interview, I received a pretty challenging problem&mdash;I remember thinking when I got it that I was going to mess it up. But somehow I solved it with ease, and all of my outputs were correct. I'm not sure whether to attribute it to the accruing notches on my belt or to blind luck, but I aced the phone screen and they eagerly brought me on-site.

I've always had a lot of respect for Airbnb as a company&mdash;I was an early Airbnb user myself&mdash;but even as I was walking into their large and beautiful campus, my mind was already made up. I was joining Google.

The Airbnb interview was long and challenging. But, unlike the Google interview, it was invigorating. I met with payments engineers, infrastructure engineers, even a political analyst who worked on European Airbnb regulation. I was challenged on my understanding of algorithms, of caching layers and database indices, I was questioned on my beliefs about the human right of free movement across borders and on the future of travel.

I loved it. I loved everyone I met. Even more, I loved the spirit of Airbnb. Everything about it&mdash;the beautiful cosmopolitan office built as an homage to Airbnbs around the world, the people, the technology, the raw energy and drive toward connecting the world more tightly together.

Airbnb's mission is simply, &ldquo;Belong Anywhere.&rdquo; I've been both an Airbnb guest and a host for years, and before that I was an avid Couchsurfer and Couchsurfing host. I believe strongly in the culture of sharing and interconnection.

But even so. Yeah, Airbnb was pretty cool. (And walking distance to my house!) But still, Google is Google&mdash;the tech equivalent of getting an invitation to the Justice League. How could I turn that down?

After the interview, Airbnb was slow to get back to me. Being a challenging interview, I was unsure whether an offer would come through&mdash;much less, if it could change anything. I'd already finished my last day working at App Academy, and was now officially between jobs. I decided to head home for a bit to wrap up my negotiations and rest up before starting my next gig. I had a short deadline until I wanted to start, and let each of the companies know. It was now time to go into final negotiations.

## Turning Point

I get the phone call. Airbnb wants to make an offer. I have less than a week, but they're scrambling to piece everything together to meet my deadline. They'll get back to me.

They get back. Initial offer, 220K.

220K?

Jesus Christ.

What??

What on earth are they doing offering me 220K? This company must be out of its goddamn mind. No wonder tech is so overvalued. I lost my shit.

I had to take this really seriously now. Airbnb's offer was highly illiquid, but they were offering me a very strong base salary: 130K, 25K signing bonus, and 65K worth of RSUs a year. Not as liquid as Google, no doubt. But Airbnb as a company was barreling toward an IPO, already worth more than 23B, and was of the most robust tech companies from a business and revenue perspective. Besides, if I'm risk-neutral&mdash;which I think I am&mdash;then it's a clearly better deal.

I began really weighing things. Google&hellip;was Google. I already knew its advantages.

But at Airbnb, I'd clearly be able to take on more responsibility more quickly. The engineering organization was slated to double within a year. I was already very familiar with Airbnb's tech stack, mostly Ruby on Rails, since it was what I'd been teaching at App Academy and developing on for the last year. It was also younger company. Unlike Google and its &ldquo;lifers,&rdquo; this was a place where I'd be more likely to meet people in an earlier stage in their lives&mdash;and meet potential co-founders.

Of course, it was also walking distance (the ol' commute-less commute).

But, seemingly more affecting than all of those things&mdash;they needed me. At Google, I'd be a smart person sitting in a smart person chair. I'd be doing serious engineering work no doubt, but by the time I'd be done, I'd be walking away having changed little more than my own resume.

At Airbnb, they really needed my help. They believed I could make a difference. For the life of me I couldn't figure out why, but they made it clear. They thought I was valuable, and they wanted someone with my experience.

God, I'm a sap.

I had less than a week to decide. I didn't know how to make the decision. So I started trying to evaluate everything objectively. I tried estimating the value of different outcomes. I tried to ascribe weights and calculate the value of things like network, branding, growth, faster promotion, potential for meeting co-founders, likelihood of IPOing. But nothing was convincing. It felt like an impossible choice. Before long it was Thursday night and I had to make a decision before the end of day Friday. There was a lot of cursing.

Google was assuring me that they'd raise their number by Friday morning. That night I couldn't sleep. I repeatedly got out of bed, pacing back and forth rehearsing conversations, frantically checking my e-mail and re-tweaking Excel models. What the fuck? Just a few weeks ago I could barely get anyone to look at my resume. My first offer barely cleared 120K. 220K? What on earth is Airbnb thinking??

That night and the following morning, I called up trusted friends and asked them what I should do. I was on the phone off and on for several hours through that morning. The consensus was overwhelming.

Everyone thought I should go with Airbnb.

## Final Hours

That morning, worn thin with sleep deprivation, I got a call from Google. They were raising the offer to 211K. That's 211K. Liquid. I'd receive all of that before a year's end. I remember scratching my chin and just laughing. God fucking dammit. I thanked my recruiter, and let her know I'd get back to her before the end of the day.

I knew Google would have a strong final offer, maybe upwards of 200K, but 211K was stronger than I'd expected. Still, it shouldn't sway my decision, right? Was this really a decision within a margin of 10K in EV? No one else seemed to think so. If Airbnb was the winner, it should still be the winner now.

Right?

I told myself: if I'm choosing Airbnb, just remember. 220K was their *initial* offer. That means there's money on the table. If there's one thing this job search had taught me, is that there's always, always more money on the table.

As an instructor at App Academy I ceaselessly pushed my students to negotiate hard, without fear of being rejected, looking stupid, or being perceived as greedy. Employers negotiate even harder and with more power behind them, and so it's up to candidates to tip the scales back in the direction of employees. As absurd as it seemed now, given an offer of 220K, I had to take my own advice and ask for more. I rehearsed it again and again in my head.

But if I'm going to ask for more, I shouldn't just ask for 10K more. I should expect to be met somewhere in the middle, right? I've got to be aggressive. But I don't have any stronger offers and they know that, so maybe it's stupid.

Fuck.

I called my recruiter from Airbnb and, half expecting to get laughed at, announced: &ldquo;If Airbnb can move up the RSUs by 30K to hit a total of 250K in all-in compensation, then I'll sign.&rdquo;

&ldquo;250K? Do I have your word?&rdquo; she said.

&ldquo;My word.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Okay. Let me see what I can do. I'll get back to you before evening.&rdquo;

The rest of the afternoon was a blur of habitually checking my phone, email, anything for some word of what would happen. I was driving my car into Austin, bumper-to-bumper in traffic when I got the phone call. It was the Airbnb recruiter.

&ldquo;Haseeb? This is Janice.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Janice! What's the word??&rdquo; I held my breath.

&ldquo;I made the magic happen. 250K. 130K salary, 25K signing, 95K a year in RSUs. So you're in?&rdquo;

I almost swerved into the car next to me from punching the air so hard.

&ldquo;I'm in.&rdquo;

So that's the story. I start on Monday.

## Overview

On the whole, I'm really excited to be joining the Airbnb family. It's definitely a different path than Google. Most significantly, there'll be less that I can donate to charity in a year's time. But not only is the total value of the assets greater, I'm also convinced that in the longer term, Airbnb will be the better move for my career.

Stock in a private company is of course still a valuable asset&mdash;I just won't be able to donate a third of their value until a liquidation event (hopefully an IPO). But my pledge to donate 1/3rd of all of my income, including my salary, doesn't change. Ultimately, this will be a better move in terms of EV, provided some discounting for the fact that I'll have to donate later in the future.

That said, the brand of the company was obviously an explicit consideration for me. From that perspective, my choice to join Airbnb might seem a little strange to some. In many parts of the world, Google and Airbnb wouldn't even be said in the same sentence. But within the SF ecosystem, Airbnb and Google are largely considered to be in the same tier of engineering organizations. I'd even argue that among certain crowds, Airbnb would be a stronger signal on one's resume than Google would be.

So I think, on the whole, I really got lucky with a company that's a perfect fit for what I'm looking for.

One other thing I want to add. I know some might think it's weird to be sharing your compensation in a public venue like this. I take my inspiration from [Jeff Kaufman](http://www.jefftk.com/donations) (who ironically works for Google, albeit in Boston), who donates 50% of his income to EA charities and catalogues it publicly every year.

The norm of keeping compensation secret is a very American one. And I think on the whole, it stifles transparency and open dialogue about things like class and economic inequality. But more poignantly, it makes it harder to be transparent and galvanizing about earning-to-give, which is very much one of my goals.

I explicitly entered into tech a year ago because I believed it was a place where I'd be uniquely well-suited to create a lot of value. It's an industry where smart, driven young people can quickly earn an outsized income. Seeing that opportunity, I decided to pivot into tech and make building a career here an active aim of my life. And I hope to, as long as I can, continue to speak openly about my compensation and give even more of it away.

So that's enough of soapboxing. Here are some stats.

## A Few Statistics

By the end of my process, I had received a total of 8 job offers (not including re-negotiation with App Academy). I had completed 12 onsites total, so my I had a total onsite-to-offer rate of 66%.

Considering only the onsites after receiving my first offer however, my onsite-to-offer rate was 87%.

Of my offers, 2 of them were through TripleByte (one from TripleByte itself, the other, Gusto, through their introduction). The remainder were through referrals. Two of the 6 referrals were non-engineering referrals.

There were 12 companies where I was referred but did not receive an offer. 25% of the companies I was referred to didn't even talk to me. But that was a lot better than the base rate: overall, 53% of companies I applied to through any means rejected me without even talking to me.

In the end, I didn't get a single offer through a raw application. Every single offer came through a referral of some kind. (This I did not expect, and strongly influences the advice I'd give to a job-seeker.)

The differential between my lowest (initial) offer and my highest (final) offer was, in total value, an increase of 104%. That is, my compensation literally more than doubled by not accepting my first job offer. (I expect this to be highly anomalous, since companies had a lot of discrepancies in where they leveled me on their engineering ladders.)

The largest percentage increase was also with my lowest initial offer, Yelp. They started at a total annualized value of 122.5K (105K salary + 17.5K stock), and their final offer was at a total value of 180K, an increase of $57.5K, or 47%. Again, I expect this to be anomalous, because I literally jumped in engineering levels (they initially offered me a junior role, then re-evaluated). The second largest increase was from Google, moving up $48.6K for an increase of 30%. This one is perhaps less anomalous. I'm not sure.

On all but two of my offers, I negotiated. The average delta for company offers at which I negotiated was +$30,671 for the final offer. So, negotiation pays, boys and girls. More on that later.

In total, I received offers from Airbnb, Youtube (Google subsidiary), Uber, Twitch (Amazon subsidiary), Yelp, Stripe, Gusto, and TripleByte. The average value of the final offers was approximately $193,600. The salaries were all approximately the same at $130K. (Only one company offered me a base salary of $125K.) I should also note that I negotiated more aggressively on RSUs and signing bonus. I'll also talk more about that later.

There's obviously a lot in this department, but this blog post is already long enough. I'm going to write one more post before I start at Airbnb this coming Monday: my key takeaways from this job search, and advice to current job seekers. I'll also talk more about my thoughts on negotiation in that upcoming post.

Look forward to it!

### Update (4/25/2016)

This post has gotten a lot of unexpected attention, so I want to clarify a couple things.

First (and this should go without saying), everything mentioned in my story are my own thoughts and words, and though I am employed by Airbnb, I in no way speak on their behalf. (It's legally important to say that, I guess.)

That said, I realize that pay transparency is a controversial subject, and I seem to have stirred up a hornet's nest. So I want to make clear a few things.

Many people seem to think that publicly disclosing your compensation is a fireable offense, and that Airbnb will fire me now that they see I've posted this. Neither of those statements are true.

It's explicitly illegal under the National Labor Relations Act to fire workers for discussing their compensations, and it has been illegal in American law since 1935. This kind of policy is known as &ldquo;Pay Secrecy,&rdquo; and such policies have been repeatedly struck down by courts.

See: [Pay Secrecy Policies at Work are Often Illegal and Misunderstood](http://www.npr.org/2014/04/13/301989789/pay-secrecy-policies-at-work-often-illegal-and-misunderstoo).

And yet, pay secrecy is considered the norm in American culture.

There was a time in American history when income tax records were in the public domain. Even now, there are many cultures in which talking about your compensation is not at all considered wrong or disrespectful. Rather, it's seen as an important part of creating a transparent society.

Pay secrecy is an easy fallback, because talking about social inequality and pay differentials is uncomfortable. It's especially uncomfortable in American culture, where your salary often serves as a signal of your social status.

But pay secrecy carries with it a lot of costs. It can hide gender and racial discrimination, systemic exploitation, and nepotism. It's easy to sweep these problems under the rug and not want to look at them. And for what it's worth, I have a lot of respect to Airbnb for openly working toward solving these problems in the culture they're building.

These are complicated problems. I don't have all the answers. But because I am committed to effective altruism and publicly earning-to-give, I will continue to be open every year about how much I donate (and by association, how much I earn), insofar as it's possible.

(For further reading, check out [Your Coworkers Should Know Your Salary](https://hbr.org/ideacast/2016/03/your-coworkers-should-know-your-salary), published in the Harvard Business Review. Also, [my response to a commenter on how disclosing my salary might be unwise or affect colleagues at Airbnb](https://haseebq.com/farewell-app-academy-hello-airbnb-part-ii/#comment-2738).)

The second thing I want to say is that for some reason, many people are drawing the conclusion that I primarily got a job at Airbnb by being really good at negotiating, or gaming the system, or something like that.

**If you have ever done a software engineering interview, you would know that this is completely absurd.** There is no way to negotiate or charm someone into passing a software engineering interview. Much less 8 of them.

If you don't know the ins and outs of object-oriented programming, database design, asymptotic analysis, binary search trees, or how to improve the cache efficiency of an algorithm, then you're not going to pass a computer science-heavy interview at a top company. You don't even have a shot at it.

The moral of my story is **not** &ldquo;get really good at negotiating and you'll get a great job.&rdquo; Negotiating is important, and I certainly encourage everyone to negotiate!

But first, get good at the thing you're doing. Then worry about negotiating.

I moved to San Francisco from Austin, Texas about a year ago because I decided I was going to [earn-to-give](https://haseebq.com/why-ive-decided-to-devote-my-career-to-earning-to-give/). Since then I've been relentlessly trying to build a new career for myself, so I could earn more and donate more to charity.

Entering into App Academy, barely knowing the basics of Ruby, I came into the office and grinded every day, spending 80+ hour weeks just coding and studying. I'd come in at 9AM in the morning and leave around midnight, 7 days a week, sleeping in a bunk bed in SOMA in a 200 square feet shared room.

It's certainly true that I probably have a mind that's well-suited for coding. But it's also true that I outworked almost everyone who was in my cohort. And when I was hired by App Academy to help teach the course, I continued working as hard as I could to get good at this.

I still stayed late in the evenings, I still came into the office on weekends alongside the students just to continue coding and learning more. I started an algorithms study group in the evenings where I taught students new algorithms that I had read about, and wrote specs and instructions to guide them through the implementation. I took over our entire algorithms curriculum and taught well over 100 students the basics of data structures and algorithms.

And of course, I was scared that none of this would matter. That having been an English major, having a non-traditional background, being 26 and too old to transition into tech, competing against 20 year olds who'd been coding since they were 10, I thought I must have no chance.

Thankfully, I was wrong. And I'm very, very lucky that I was wrong, because I was almost right.

So if there's one takeaway I want people to have, it's not &ldquo;here's why it pays to be a master negotiator.&rdquo; I'm going to talk a lot more about negotiation advice in my next blog post, but that's almost a detail compared to the larger point.

The real takeaway should be: *get so good that they can't ignore you.* Because once you are, they won't.

title: How to Break Into the Tech Industryâ€”a Guide to Job Hunting and Tech Interviews
tags: [tech careers]
image: coding-924920_960_720_wtwest.jpg
---

I recently completed a job search for my first role as a software engineer.

Despite having first learned how to code almost a year before, having a background as an English major and former professional poker player, I was able to land a total of 8 offers including Google, Uber, Yelp, and Airbnb (where I ultimately joined). In this three-part blog post I'm going to describe my advice to a job-seeker trying to break into the tech industry.

If you haven't read the story of my job search, [you can read about it here]( https://haseebq.com/farewell-app-academy-hello-airbnb-part-i/). It provides some of the backdrop for this post.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DgcI0mQXATI/">[video]</div>

First, several caveats.

I have a weird background, but make no mistake&mdash;I both worked my ass off and got very lucky. When I got my job offers, I was working as an instructor and Director of Product of App Academy, and had been studying (and teaching) this stuff for a little under a year.

In light of that, some people have interpreted this as a &ldquo;get rich quick&rdquo; sort of thing. It's not. It's more of a a &ldquo;go into a cave for six months and hopefully get a job when you emerge&rdquo; sort of thing. Subtle difference, but an important one.

Note that my advice here draws not just from my own experience, but also from the advice of many others. It also comes from observing the job searches of 200+ App Academy students breaking into the tech industry.

That said, take all of my advice with a grain of salt. There are people out there who are much more successful than I, and who know much more about this domain. So if you find there's some aspect of my advice that seems flat-out wrong or contradicted by others, defer to your own judgment.

I entered into tech so that I could [earn-to-give](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earning_to_give). My hope is that in supplying this advice, I will encourage and enable others to do the same.

I've broken this up into three parts: getting interviews, the interview process, and negotiating. This post will cover the first two parts, and I'll conclude with a lot of advice about the negotiation process in a subsequent post.

Note: this advice will be primarily geared toward the software engineer market in the Bay Area, but a lot of the advice will be generally applicable. When I mention &ldquo;engineering,&rdquo; just substitute your own field. Though the details might be different, the underlying dynamics are largely the same.

I hope you find this post helpful in your own job search.

<h2 id="part1">Part 1: Job Hunting</h2>

First and foremost, job hunting is a numbers game. You must have faith in the numbers.

If I told you that you have a 4% chance of getting an offer from any application, that might seem dishearteningly low. But mathematically that means that 50 such applications will give you an 87% chance of getting at least one job offer.

And yet, any given application is almost certainly not going to be the one that ends up turning into an offer.

That's okay. Expect those dynamics. It's weird and counterintuitive, but you should probably expect the company that ultimately gives you an offer to seem like a long shot. This is because almost every application will seem like a long shot.

Be comfortable with that. Trust in the law of large numbers.

This applies to networking, raw applications, even to phone screens and on-sites.

### Networking

Networking is probably the highest leverage activity in getting job offers.

Networking sounds intimidating. But I promise you, at its heart, it's pretty simple.

Just buy everyone coffee.

And when I say everyone, I mean everyone who works at a tech company.

Every time you meet someone in tech, and I mean anyone at all, you should tell them, &ldquo;Hey, that's really cool. I'm actually trying to get a job as a software engineer. I don't know very much about [the thing you do]. I'd love to buy you coffee and pick your brain about it. Are you free sometime this week around [time]?&rdquo;

Buy tons and tons of coffee for people. Do it religiously and have no shame about it. I don't care if you can't afford it. Go broke inviting people to coffee.

In fact, if you go broke, let me know and I'll fund your coffee dates until you land an awesome job and can pay me back.

How do you meet tech people in the first place? Go to [meetups](https://meetup.com). Go to local events. Go to developer conferences. Go to house parties. (Techies are normal people, and people are everywhere.)

Get creative. @Message people on Twitter. Cold-email them (specific people, not companies). Don't be creepy, but it's totally okay to reach out to people out of the blue, learn about them online, and ask directly if you can buy them coffee.

Most importantly, *plumb your network*. Chances are, you have friends or friends of friends who already work at tech companies. You're just not paying attention.

Okay.

So now you've got a bunch of coffee dates lined up with all these random people who work for tech companies. Some of them might be engineers, or managers, operations, designers, customer support, salespeople. Doesn't matter. Meet anyone and everyone.

Once you've sat someone down for coffee, it's time for an **[informational interview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informational_interview)**.

### Informational Interviewing

Here's what you do in an informational interview.

First, learn everything and anything you can about this person. Learn everything you can about their company. Learn everything you can about the industry or technology they work with.

Notice I didn't say &ldquo;ask for a job.&rdquo; **Don't ask for a job.** This is not about you asking for a job. This is about everything other than you asking for a job.

Get to know them! Get to know their company! Learn more about what they do and why it's important. Ask things you really want to know.

They should be doing most of the talking, otherwise you're doing it wrong. Shut up and ask more questions.

Chances are, if you shut up for long enough, they'll be curious about you and want to know what you're doing. Tell them your story. Tell them about who you are, what brought you here, and why you want a job as a software engineer.

At the end of the conversation, go for the close&mdash;which, most of the time, is not to ask for a job referral. **Do not ask for a referral unless they bring it up.** Rather, ask them: &ldquo;who else do you know who'd be a good person for me to talk to?&rdquo; Tell them you want to learn more about front-end development, or cryptography, or iOS, or whatever you were asking them questions about.

You *were* asking them questions, right?

If they can't think of anyone to pass you along to, ask them if they know any other engineers anywhere you could talk to. Or anyone at all who works at another tech company you're interested in. Whatever it is, get contacts for more people to get introduced to. Every conversation should lead to at least one more contact.

Then, just keep following this chain. Schedule more coffee dates, ask more questions, get more contacts. Go through all of it without asking for any unsolicited referrals.

This might seem weird. But studies have shown that this is the most effective way to get a job. And ultimately, it's the most effective way to generate referrals outside of your network.

Why does this work?

It works because people **hate it** when you ask them for a job.

Give you a job? Why? They don't know you. Why would they give you a job? Why would they even waste their time on you?

The power of informational interviewing is that instead of making it about you, *you make it about them*. People like to talk about themselves. They like to teach others. They want to help. But they don't want to be pestered by strangers for favors.

If you keep doing this, people will see your curiosity and your genuineness. They'll believe in your story, and *they will want to refer you*. By not pressuring people to recommend you, you will make them want to do so&mdash;or, at the very least, become an ally in your journey.

The reality is, most people *can't* refer you. This is because their company might be too small to hire junior devs, or they might not need people with your skillset, or they might have overhired for the quarter, or, believe it or not, their company could just be secretly failing and not have any money.

That's okay.

If you do this enough times, someone will eventually float the idea: &ldquo;I could refer you if you want.&rdquo;

If they say this, graciously ask them if they'd be comfortable doing so. They'll then say yes. Now say &ldquo;golly gee, that would be swell.&rdquo; Then follow up with them over e-mail, thank them, and send them your resume. Congrats, you've just landed yourself a referral.

See? That wasn't so hard.

Now keep them posted on your progress through their company's pipeline. Don't hesitate to also ask them for further advice.

Oh, and, before you leave that coffee date, still ask them for more contacts. I mean it. The chain stops for no one.

### Getting the Chain Started

But how do you start the chain?

Chances are, you already have contacts in the tech industry. Even if you think you don't, you probably do. Go scour your LinkedIn, your Facebook, ask your family, talk to people you kinda knew in high school. Nothing is off limits.

Make a spreadsheet of every single person you know who works for a tech company. Mark down what company they work for, and what their role is at that company.

Then sort all of your contacts by company, and then by role. You should reach out to your most relevant contact at every single company on your list (an engineer is more relevant than someone in operations, etc).

**Reach out to every single one.**

Invite them to coffee, lunch, dinner, whatever. Always buy. Farm them for referrals and further contacts. If you have a strong network, this is likely to be the most powerful source of leads for you.

This is great, because unless you have a stellar resume (which I assume you don't because you're bothering to read this guide), referrals are going to be an order of magnitude more impactful than raw applications. This is especially true at top companies.

So keep your funnel healthy. Keep scheduling coffee dates. Keep networking, even if you're mid-way through your job search. I didn't stop meeting with people until I had about 4 offers, and even then I still reached out to people at new companies I was interested in.

### Resumes and Cover Letter

I'm not going to offer a lot of specific advice here, because there's so much to say and it's so individual to your background and experience. [Scour](https://www.resumonk.com/blog/dear-software-engineer-this-is-why-your-resume-was-rejected/) [the](https://www.resumonk.com/resume-examples/software-engineer-resume-examples/software-engineer-sample-resume-%231) [internet](https://jsonresume.org/schema/) for resources. I'd strongly recommend getting your resume reviewed by someone who knows what they're doing.

Resume short version: keep your resume to one page, always. Highlight anything that sounds kinda math-y or technical. Measure everything in terms of impact, don't just describe your responsibilities. Make your resume pretty, especially if you're claiming to be a front-end or full-stack developer. Don't use Arial or Times New Roman. A little bit of design effort will go a long way. [Never, ever have typos](http://blog.alinelerner.com/lessons-from-a-years-worth-of-hiring-data/).

Some people read cover letters, some people don't. You usually need to write one, and you'll likely end up coming up with a script that you adapt. Always personalize them&mdash;try to find some reason why you like the company's mission or find their work interesting. Keep it short, and minimize the cruft. If you need more advice, there's no shortage out there on the internet for cover letter advice.

### Job Platforms

Get on all the job hiring platforms. The first job offers I got were from [TripleByte](https://triplebyte.com), which I cannot recommend highly enough for software engineers.

Also set up a profile on [AngelList](http://angel.co), [WhiteTruffle](https://www.whitetruffle.com/), [SmartHires](https://www.smarthires.io/), and all the rest. Apply to [Hired](https://hired.com). Clean up your LinkedIn and Github profiles. Get your projects up and README'd and pretty.

Even if some of these platforms reject you or you don't get any bites, they're enormous return on investment for the time you'll spend.

### Mass Applying

Referrals and job platforms are unequivocally higher-yield strategies, but you shouldn't ignore raw applications. This is especially true if you have a strong resume, as you're likely to have a higher reply rate. Raw applications are low investment, so you might as well pump them out in your free time and maximize the number of potential bites. They are also the primary way I've seen most App Academy students get jobs, so they certainly work. But they require more volume.

I recommend most people mix in some mass applying into their strategy.

You should pre-commit to a number of companies to apply to per day.

Mass applying to companies is really mind-numbing. It's easy to lose focus. So structure your time and set goals for yourself. Apply to batches of companies in 45-minute sprints. Use [Pomodoros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) to keep yourself on point and accountable.

### Company Size

From my observations, small-medium size companies are more likely to take a chance on a raw application.

Large and prestigious companies tend to have rigid resume review processes, and are more likely to trash your resume if it's not studded with exciting phrases like &ldquo;Stanford PhD&rdquo; or &ldquo;literally a superhero.&rdquo;

Tiny companies are hit-or-miss.

Shoot for unsexy companies. You're much more likely to get an interview, and at this stage, getting interview experience under your belt is ultimately what matters.

Understand: just having your first offer matters much more than where the offer is from. Even if the offer is from a company you're not excited about, you can easily leverage it up to a company you want more. More on this later when we talk about negotiation.

### Study, study, study

This is perhaps the most important piece, and where a lot of the hustle comes in. You need to study your ass off. Your study habits are one of the chief determinants of your performance in interviews (not to mention your performance in your subsequent job).

You're trying to break into this field, so break in!

Below, I'm going to give my general advice to someone aiming for a role as a full-stack or back-end developer. If you want to get a job doing front-end development, game development, embedded systems, or anything sufficiently specialized, you should look up more specific advice for those fields.

This is the preparation that I personally used. My approach to studying has been informed by my knowledge of performance psychology and by the science of learning. But your mileage may vary.

I'm going to assume you already know how to program. If you don't at all, [read this instead as a first step](https://haseebq.com/cracking-the-coding-bootcamp-the-definitive-guide/).

I should also note that the following advice is strongly tailored toward interviews at larger, more prestigious companies. At smaller companies, your interview is less likely to consist of abstract algorithms problems. You may have to do raw coding exercises, fix a bug in production code, or build a small semi-practical system. It's also more likely you'll be asked questions about specific languages or frameworks. I ran into a few of these interviews, but only at smaller companies. Adjust your study plan accordingly.

Disclaimer: a common refrain in tech is that &ldquo;programming interviews are broken.&rdquo; I agree. I think standard tech interviews are poor predictors of software engineering ability. But like any good hacker, I designed this advice to be a reverse-engineering of the standard programming interview. Take it for what it is, and no more.

### General Study Strategy

First, a high-level roadmap.

Watch the [Princeton Coursera course on algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI) (by Robert Sedgewick), mostly up until Dijkstra's algorithm and not much more than that. Try to follow along and code as you go. You don't need to implement things in Java unless you already know Java.

Read [The Algorithm Design Manual](http://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1462241467&sr=8-1&keywords=algorithm+design+manual+skiena&tag=charity48-20) for general algorithms and data structures background. Go through most of it. (You can skip the giant appendix about specific algorithmic topics).

Buy [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Programming/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1462241515&sr=8-1&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview&tag=charity48-20). We'll be using this as a repository of coding problems and solutions.

Listen regularly to podcasts about software like [Software Engineering Daily](http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/podcast/) or [The Bike Shed](http://bikeshed.fm/). Read [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). There's a lot of stuff you won't understand, but that's okay. Just soak it in. Over time, this will give you some familiarity with modern web stacks, current trends, and how developers talk.

For system design and architecture, I recommend reading through [HiredInTech](http://www.hiredintech.com/system-design) and reading a bunch of the top blog posts on [High Scalability](http://highscalability.com/all-time-favorites/) (appears to be down at the time of posting). There's also a massive [Github repo of resources](https://github.com/checkcheckzz/system-design-interview) you can check out specifically for systems design interviews.

If you already know a programming language, do your practicing in whatever language you know best. Interviewers won't care. If you have a choice among languages, prefer expressive scripting languages like Ruby, Python, JavaScript, etc. More on this later when we talk about interview advice.

Object oriented design and code organization are very important concepts, and they'll come up in interviews. Unfortunately, there's pretty much no way to learn them other than by just writing lots of well-structured programs, and getting critiques and code reviews.

If you have no programming background at all, this is one of the places where a (good) coding bootcamp helps tremendously. They will give you a lot of experience just writing programs and being critiqued on your coding style. But there are always online communities where you can find substitutes, such as on [Stack Exchange](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/).

If you're struggling to understand a concept in a book or on Wikipedia, look up Youtube videos of people explaining it in different ways until you get it. I've found this strategy amazingly effective.

Ask human beings for help when you're struggling. If you don't know anyone, get on StackOverflow or find a good IRC channel for the language you're working in. Be a burden on others. Ask quickly and unashamedly. You have my permission.

If you're working on an algorithms problem (such as out of CTCI) and can't figure it out, spend no more than 20-30 minutes without making progress. Just go look up the answer. Contrary to popular belief, most struggling past 30 minutes is pointless.

Some people will disagree with this.

Screw those people.

That said, if you find up having to look up the answer to more than 2/3rds of problems, your problem set is too hard and you need to downgrade.

But banging your head against a wall or staring blankly at code is a waste of time. For code/algorithms problems, you very much want to maximize the density of learning per hour.

Any time you look up the answer to a coding problem, try to understand the solution. Walk through it with a debugger if it's particularly mysterious. Read multiple explanations of why it works.

Then&mdash;and this is **extremely** important&mdash;if you didn't solve the problem completely on your own, treat the problem as though you never solved it at all. Put it back into your rotation of problems. Mark it as something you need to try again from scratch. Wait at least a day, and try to solve it fresh. If you fail, rinse and repeat ad infinitum.

And finally, structure the hell out of your learning. Make a schedule. Know exactly when you're going to be working on this stuff, when you're going to take breaks, when you're going to go to lunch, etc. Build flexibility into your schedule, but have clear goals for how many hours a day you'll spend studying.

That's most of my general studying advice. Now here's the specific study guide I'd recommend.

### Programming Interview Study Guide

First and foremost, work through the Princeton algorithms course. You should follow along and implement as much as you can. Along the way, also implement all these major data structures. (Many of these are not explicitly covered in the course&mdash;implement them on your own).

* Linked List
* [Dynamic array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array), implemented with a [ring buffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer) (use a statically sized array underneath the hood)
* Hash set
* [Hash map (with chaining)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#Separate_chaining_with_linked_lists)
* Binary heap (without decrease-key; know that [Fibonacci heaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_heap) exist and know their guarantees)
* Binary search tree (doesn't need to be self-balancing; know that [self-balancing trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_binary_search_tree#Implementations) exist and know their guarantees)
* Prefix tree (a.k.a. trie)
* Suffix tree (don't worry about compression, just build a dumb version; know that [Ukkonen's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukkonen%27s_algorithm) exists and learn its guarantees)
* An object-oriented [adjacency list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list) for graphs

Know all of the time complexities for their basic operations. It helps to visually intuit them. Look at images. Draw them out on paper/whiteboard.

Once you've gotten all of those out of the way, implement this subset of the most common algorithms:

* Binary search (implement it both iteratively and recursively)
* Randomized quicksort (pay extra attention to the partition subroutine, as it's useful in a lot of places)
* Mergesort
* Breadth-first search in a graph
* Depth-first search in a graph (augment it to detect cycles)
* Tree traversals (pre-order, in-order, post-order)
* Topological sort (using [Tarjan's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#Depth-first_search))
* Dijkstra's algorithm ([without decrease-key](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9255620/why-does-dijkstras-algorithm-use-decrease-key))
* Longest common subsequence (using dynamic programming with matrices)
* Knapsack problem (also dynamic programming)

Know the time complexities and space complexities of all of these algorithms ([cheat-sheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)). Know the difference between [amortized, average](http://stackoverflow.com/a/7335098), and worst-case time guarantees.

Do at least one or two problems where you BFS or DFS through a matrix.

Once you finish these you should have a decent grounding in algorithms and data structures. Read through the entirety of *Algorithm Design Manual* to solidify your understanding. Implement anything that you find sufficiently interesting.

A few points of interest: learn about heap sort, but don't bother coding it. Know that it's O(1) space but practically very slow due to cache-inefficiency. Learn about quickselect and median-of-medians. Code them if you want.

Learn the basics of bit manipulation. Be able to explain what AND, OR, and XOR do. Know what a signed integer is. Know that there are 8 bits in a byte. Know what assembly is (from a high level), and get a sense of the basic operations that hardware exposes. [This awesome video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZUDEaLa5Nw) about the inner workings of the original Game Boy covers just about all you need to know.

Learn about SQL databases. Learn how to design a SQL database schema; it comes up in interviews often. Read about ACID, the CAP theorem, and BASE (you don't need to memorize the terms, just understand the concepts at a high level.) Understand why joins can become unscalable. Learn the basics of [NoSQL databases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI_g07C_Q5I).

Read about caches and cache efficiency. Know what a cache miss is. Know that reading from registers is lightning-fast, reading from the various caches is pretty fast, reading from memory is slow, and that reading from the hard disk is abysmally slow.

Read how to implement an LRU cache, and then actually write one that gets and sets in worst-case O(1) time. This is a weirdly common interview problem.

[Learn what happens when you type a URL into your browser and press enter](http://igoro.com/archive/what-really-happens-when-you-navigate-to-a-url/comment-page-3/). Be comfortable talking about DNS lookups, the request-response cycle, HTTP verbs, TCP vs UDP, and how cookies work. Shows up all the time in interviews.

Learn the standard ways to speed up a slow website. This includes a lot of things like adding database indices to optimize common queries, better caching, loading front-end assets from a CDN, cleaning up zombie listeners, etc. Also an interview classic, pretty rabbit-holey.

(These last two are obviously web development specific.)

Once you've covered those, you now have most of the grounding you need. You should be ready to start interview circuit training.

(If you already have a background in CS, I'd probably start here.)

### Interview Circuit Training

First, work through the first 3 problems on every relevant section of *Cracking the Coding Interview*. (That is, skip sections like Java or C++ if you don't know those languages, skip testing, skip concurrency unless you have experience writing concurrent programs. Do read about it though.)

Write out your solutions in code. Make sure they work. Check edge cases.

After you've written a good 30+ solutions, stop coding every single solution. By now you should have some solid coding practice, and you should be developing your high-level intuition how to determine the optimal approach to a problem. The rest is pattern recognition.

Continue working through the rest of *Cracking the Coding Interview*. But from here on out, instead of actually writing code, just write a high-level description of the algorithm you'd use to solve the problem.

Here's an example of what I mean: &ldquo;First sort the array, then repeatedly binary search through it on each subsequent query. This should take nlog(n) pre-processing and log(n) for each query.&rdquo;

That's enough detail. Once you've written your high-level solution, check it against the solution in the book. If your solution is suboptimal, write a description of the optimal solution. Make sure it makes sense to you. If it even *slightly* doesn't make sense and you're not confident you could write the code, then code it up, test for edge cases, etc.

With this workflow, you should be coding only a small percentage of the remaining problems. You should be able to work through many more problems a day now.

Make sure you have your solutions collected into files so that you can review them easily. In your solutions files, you should also have the problem statement along with any solution you have written/described.

Whenever you review them (which you should at weekly intervals), here's how you should review: read the problem statement only, decide how you'd solve the problem in your head, and then check it against the algorithm you have written down. Again, reaffirm to yourself why the correct answer is correct.

Once you make it through the entire book, spend the remainder of your study time grinding problems on [LeetCode](http://leetcode.com).

LeetCode is an online coding platform like HackerRank or CodeWars that gives you a problem statement and lets you write code against test cases.

I recommend LeetCode particularly because it has the most accurate problem set I've seen for what most algorithms interviews are like. It also has an awesome feature that it tags programming problems by companies where the problem was asked. (If the company has fewer than 2000 employees, then it's unlikely to be tagged anywhere.)

So any time you have an interview at a big company, do every single problem that company is tagged with on LeetCode. You have to pay for a subscription to see the tags, but it's worth it.

GlassDoor is also a good source of company-specific problems to grind on. (You can also try CareerCup, but their accuracy tends to be a bit more dubious.)

After all that, there's one last piece that's missing&mdash;actual interview practice. One of the chief principles of learning is *practice like performance*. That is, make the way you practice as close to the actual performance as possible. In this case, the actual performance will be standing in front of a whiteboard and getting verbally interviewed by someone.

Practice for it.

Find someone to mock-interview you in front of a whiteboard (and reciprocate for them afterward). Have them ask you questions you've never seen before. Practice all of your interviewing skills, including introducing yourself, clarifying the problem, making jokes, everything that you plan to do in a real interview. Treat it as though it's the real thing. Be willing to struggle and look stupid. Don't let yourself break character.

This is also really the only way to practice architecture-oriented interviews. Have your interviewer ask you about the request-response cycle or how you'd architect Twitter, or other standard interview favorites.

A great resource is [interviewing.io](http://interviewing.io/), which allows you to anonymously interview and get interviewed by other people and practice programming problems. They're in private beta right now, but check them out.

If you actually implement every part of this workflow, you should become an algorithms beast within a few months. Your performance on a coding interview will be comparable if not superior to the average CS graduate.

There's nothing magical about any of this. It's all just practice. All of the information you need to pass a coding interview is out there, freely available. It's up to you to put the time in.

Okay.

You're clearly awesome at algorithms now, so let's keep going.

### Staying the Path

Job searching is hard. Once you start applying to companies, you're going to get many, many rejections.

Struggling for months and getting rejected everywhere is deeply demoralizing.

It's going to feel like it's your fault. It's going to feel like something is wrong with you.

That's exactly how my job search began. The same is true for many people I know who landed awesome jobs. Almost everyone goes through this.

There are a couple stories I like to share with App Academy students.

I once worked with an App Academy student who didn't have a degree; he'd dropped out of college. He was job searching for 11 months and had submitted hundreds of applications. He was ready to completely give up on ever finding a job. But with some support and coaching, he was able to get his first offer at a startup. After some negotiating, that offer ended up being the second highest offer any student has ever received in App Academy history.

Another student I worked with had a similar story. 11 months of nothing but rejections after hundreds of applications. After getting some support, he finally received his first and only offer, and it was from Uber. He's still working there.

The moral of this story is: hang in there. Keep grinding. Remember that it's a numbers game. Keep putting yourself out there, and most importantly, keep taking care of yourself.

The simple stuff is important. It'll sound stupid, but focus on self-care before anything else in the job search.

Do things that de-stress you, whether that be meditation, taking baths, playing video games, whatever. Spend time with friends. Eat good, real food.

Make sure you're sleeping. The marginal hour spent sleeping is almost always more useful than the marginal hour spent working.

Get regular exercise, even if you don't want to and hate everything about it. Countless studies have shown that exercise is basically a panacea. It boosts personal well-being more than any other psychological intervention, including anti-depressants.

Depression will creep up on you.

If it does, notice that it's there. Talk to people about it. Don't be ashamed. Fight it actively. Exercise and Vitamin D are your allies. Spend time outside, in the sun. See a professional if you need it.

But your best defense is structuring your time. Religiously schedule yourself. Know what you should be doing everyday.

In many ways, freedom is your enemy. Let structure be your shelter.

### Mindset

I used to work as a mental coach for professional poker players, as well as other folks in high-stakes professions. A lot of that work has informed my approach to job searching.

Here's my advice on mindset.

First and foremost, treat everything as a learning experience. By that I mean, don't ever go into a phone screen or an onsite interview hoping for a job. Don't hope for anything at all. Just go there to learn, to mess up, to try things out and see what this whole interviewing thing is all about.

I'd almost say&mdash;imagine someone else was invited to this interview, and you're merely their doppelganger. You get to be a fly on the wall, try things out, but you don't really care whether they get hired or not. You're just doing it because it's interesting. And why not get more experience interviewing?

Treat every interview like this. Stop caring about the outcome. Don't hope to get hired at all, just go in there and learn.

This approach will have tremendously beneficial effects for you as a candidate. You won't be so damn nervous or terrified. You'll be less attached to the outcome and won't be crushed if you don't get the job. (Almost never does a candidate pass their first couple interviews, so you should expect that anyway.) And it makes the entire process more fun and easier to actually learn from.

The second big piece of advice is: continually set goals for yourself. But only set goals that are completely in your control.

For example, a goal like &ldquo;I want to have a job offer by January 20th&rdquo; is a terrible goal. It's not up to you. How would you even know if you're making incremental progress toward this? You'll either have a job before then or you won't.

Instead, choose goals about your own behavior. A goal like &ldquo;I want to apply to 4 jobs every weekday,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I want to ask 4 people for coffee dates every week&rdquo; are completely in your control and easy to measure.

The third and final piece of advice is on how to frame your job search. Here's a little parable I used to tell my students.

### Your Number

Imagine that somewhere, in God's Database, is a number. That number is the number of days you're going to have to work your ass off until you find a job.

Everyone has their own number in God's database. Even you.

Let's call your number N.

Every day you spend seriously job searching decrements that N by 1. You don't know what that N is of course. And you'll never know what N is until you finally get your first offer. (Assume God [sanitizes his inputs against SQL injections](https://xkcd.com/327/).)

You don't get to choose your N. Many things affect the size of your N&mdash;your experience, your education, your network, systemic biases in the industry, and some randomness. A shitload of randomness, actually.

Other people will have smaller Ns than you, even though they're not as skilled as you are. That's okay.

Ignore other people. They have it easier, and that's fine. But your N is already decided, and your only job is to whittle that N down.

So treat every day as progress. Whether you get rejected from a company, whether you screw up an interview, whether you get inexplicably lowballed, it doesn't matter. That N is getting lower and lower, and your interviewing skills are getting better and better. Be confident. You're getting closer.

Every single day is progress.

And, lastly&hellip;

### Keep Having Fun

This is really important.

Keep making things. Keep working on projects. Find things that excite you. Learn new technologies, frameworks, algorithms, languages. When someone asks you &ldquo;what are you working on lately?&rdquo; you should have a good answer&mdash;one that excites you.

Work on things that are actually fun. It'll keep you sharp, motivated, and happy.

You're breaking into this industry because you want to program, right?

So keep programming!

----

<h2 id="part2">Part 2: The Interview Process</h2>

Okay. You did all of part 1 and you've got interviews lined up. Great. Now what?

 I'm going to reiterate this again: approach every interview as a learning experience. Stop caring whether you'll get the job or not. The first few times, you'll almost certainly bomb. It's okay. Expect that and roll with it.

Interviewing is a skill, and not a particularly mysterious one. Trust that the more times you do it and the more deliberately you analyze your mistakes, the better you'll get at it.

Don't worry about getting a job. Each interview probably won't be the one that leads to a job. That's okay. Just learn and have fun. You'll perform much better that way.

### The Basics

So your interview is coming up.

If you are uncertain about anything in particular, know that you can ask your recruiter or point of contact at the company. You can ask them things like: What sort of problems will be on the interview? Anything specific I should review? Can I use Python? Will there be any pair programming? Should I bring my own laptop for coding? Will I be able to Google documentation during the interview?

These are all totally fine questions. Nobody will care at all if you ask. I've seen many people agonize over questions like these. Just ask.

Some basics:

At a tech startup in the Bay, dress nicely, but casual. Something like a sweater or button-up and jeans works well. In more conservative markets, wear a dress shirt and slacks. If you're not sure, ask your recruiter. This is in no way a taboo question.

They'll often offer you something to drink. Take it if you want it. Use their bathroom. Do whatever you can to make yourself relaxed.

When you meet your interviewer, say hello, introduce yourself. Relax. Try to remember their name. (No big deal if you don't.)

There's always some ritual to beginning an interview. It's not too complicated.

Your interviewer will walk in the room. Smile. Tell her your name. Shake hands confidently. Look her in the eye.

Adopt relaxed body language. Lean back in your chair. Try not to fidget&mdash;just clasp your hands together if you can't help it.

You're completely fine. This interview is just for practice anyway. Don't analyze yourself. No, it's not weird that your arms are dangling like that.

Ask your interviewer what team she's on and what she's been working on lately. This will get the conversation flowing.

If you're nervous, it's okay to tell them that. If you're eager to get started, it's also okay to tell them that.

### Talking About Yourself

When it comes to talking about yourself, most tech interviews are incredibly formulaic.

Almost every question you'll be asked will be a permutation of one of these four:

* What's your story / walk me through your resume / why'd you leave your last job? (these are essentially the same question)
* Why us?
* Tell me about a challenging bug you faced and how you solved it.
* Tell me about an interesting project you worked on.

The first question is particularly important. Essentially, they want to hear your personal narrative. Your answer will strongly influence their perception of you.

This really just comes down to storytelling. Consider yourself a character in a story, and structure the story with a beginning, middle, and end. There should be inflection points, characterization, and easy to understand motivations. Keep it as short as possible, while preserving color and what makes you interesting. Try not to be negative. Frame your story around seeking challenge and wanting to better yourself, rather than rejecting or disliking things.

You will tell this narrative again and again. If you interview enough, eventually it will congeal into a script. The best way to improve at it is to literally practice it out loud and listen to a recording of it. Also try to get feedback from someone whose judgment you trust, and ask them to be as ruthlessly critical as possible.

For the remaining three questions, you should have have pre-crafted answers. If you're at a loss for stories, it may help to sit down and just brainstorm every relevant story you can remember (for example, every bug you remember working on), and then narrow it down from a larger list.

It's hard to practice this effectively in a vacuum, so this is a good thing to work with someone else on.

Once you've answered all your interviewer's soft questions, they may ask you if you have questions for them. Tell them you'll save your questions until the end of the interview. This will give you more time to for the actual programming part, which is the majority of where you'll be evaluated.

Now let's look at advice for the actual programming interview. This is going to be very whiteboarding-specific, but much of the advice applies to coding on a machine as well.

### How to Approach an Interview Problem

Before you answer any (non-trivial) question, always, always, always repeat back the question in your own words. Make sure you understand exactly what they're asking.

Expect that 10% of the time, you will misunderstand what they're actually asking. If that's the case, when you repeat back the question, they'll clarify. But if you misunderstand and jump straight to working on the wrong problem, they won't correct you for a while.

This is because if you start doing things that make no sense, your interviewer is usually just going to assume that you're incompetent.

This is okay. Your interviewer has a hard job, because most people are incompetent, and it's their job to interview incompetent people.

Thus, if they see you initially do something stupid, they will not charitably assume that you're a smart person who is just having a bad day. That's fine; you'll gradually gain credibility over the course of the interview. But it's important to be mindful of this initial dynamic.

Thus, you should be as explicit as possible in all of your communication. Spell things out in nauseating detail. This will both eliminate any potential miscommunication between you and your interviewer, and will also quickly convince them that you are not incompetent. This is surprisingly important.

Okay, let's move on.

For any non-trivial question, I almost always start by working through a small-medium sized example on the whiteboard. This again confirms that I understand the problem and develops my intuition for how to solve it. It's also worth throwing in some edge cases here to give yourself a sense for why the problem is tricky.

Don't ever jump straight to coding. Even if you think you know the answer, don't jump straight to coding. First, explain your approach in the abstract. If there are problems with your approach, your interviewer will often point them out here; by jumping straight in, your interviewer is more likely to let you hang yourself.

Once you begin mentally working through the problem, try to keep talking. Don't stop moving your mouth. Do your best to let the interviewer know everything that you're thinking at all times. No matter how small or stupid or uncertain the step you're taking in your head, just say it out loud. If you need time to think, say &ldquo;give me a moment to think about this.&rdquo; Then recount the results of your thinking, even if it was unfruitful.

Engineering interviews are as much about communication and thought process as they are about results. You can absolutely pass an interview on communication alone, even if you don't get the optimal answer.

Look at your interviewer. Engage with them. Ask them questions. Make a joke. Don't ask for help, ever. And don't give up.

Don't ever, ever give up. As long as they don't give up on you, you don't give up on yourself. Keep pushing, trying different things, and if you can't think of anywhere productive to go, just explain why everything you can think of won't work.

You'll get way more help, way more leeway, and way more empathy from your interviewer if you follow this advice.

If an efficient solution doesn't immediately jump out at you, go ahead and describe the brute force solution to the problem. You'll almost always get credit for something if you at least enumerate a correct but inefficient solution. You don't have to necessarily code it (depends if they ask you to). It's usually enough to just describe how it works. Then say, &ldquo;So that solves the problem in exponential time. But it's definitely not optimal. Let me see if I can find a more efficient approach.&rdquo; This will also help you grapple with the problem, and may give you a flash of insight on how to solve it efficiently.

A good heuristic for finding a brute-force solution is asking yourself: what's the algorithm that my brain uses to try to solve this problem if I wanted to solve it by hand?

Don't be afraid of looking stupid. It's okay to be wrong. It's okay to ask questions if you don't know what something means. Take it in stride and laugh about it. At almost all of the interviews where I received an offer, I botched at least one question. Don't let it ruffle you.

That said, if you think you know what something means but you're not 100% sure, trust your intuition. You'll usually be right. If you're not, it's okay to be corrected.

### Correcting your Interviewer

Sometimes you might think your interviewer is wrong about something.

Your interviewer will definitely be sometimes wrong. But it's much, much, much more likely that you'll be the one who's wrong. Think about it: you're stressed out of your mind and coding for dear life, while your interviewer is sitting in a chair and watching the hundredth person this year struggle to solve their favorite pet problem.

As a default, always defer to your interviewer and assume that you are mistaken. Never get defensive. Figure out why you're wrong. If you are in fact right, you should be able to prove it methodically.

Okay, so you've talked everything to death, now you're ready to write code. First, say: &ldquo;Would you like me to code this up?&rdquo;

If your interviewer has any final misgivings about your approach, this gives them an opportunity to stop you. They may also sometimes stop you if your algorithm is acceptable but they want you to find a more optimal approach.

But usually they'll say yes. So let's start writing code.

### Writing Code

Just kidding. You're not ready to code yet.

Before you write anything, first verbally verify your assumptions about the input. May I assume I never get negative inputs? May I assume these are all 64-bit integers? May I assume everything in this input string is ASCII-encoded? May I assume that my input is a hash map, formatted like so? Should I raise an error for an invalid input? How should this function behave if the input is a float?

Some of the time, your interviewer will be satisfied with this attention to detail and will allow you to hand-wave some error handling for invalid inputs. But if you don't mention it at all, they might later ask you &ldquo;ah, but what if you get a negative integer?&rdquo; Then you'll have to erase something and squeeze in a line for error handling and waste more time.

You're almost ready to code now. Announce the language you're going to write this in. You should strongly prefer a dynamically typed language with a rich standard library like Ruby or Python. Choosing a language like Java or C++ will only handicap you in how long it takes to express the same algorithm. You will not be graded on how hardcore of a programmer you are, only on whether you solved the problem in the allotted time.

Now is also the time to mention if there are any special data structures or libraries you need. It's totally cool to say &ldquo;May I assume that I have a prefix tree?&rdquo; even if you don't know of a prefix tree library in your language. It's okay to just declare the API as you go: &ldquo;I'm going to assume this heap has a .pop_min method.&rdquo;

And now it's time to code.

Always start at the top left corner of the board. Board management is surprisingly important in whiteboarding interviews. Erase stuff that's in your way and give yourself as much room as possible for the code.

More board management advice: don't close blocks (whether curly braces or *if* blocks) until you actually get to them. Closing them early will make things messy if you have to then squeeze in unexpected lines of code or do a lot of erasing.

As a general habit, add plenty of white space around lines. It's very, very common to have to add extra lines somewhere in a function. The more breathing room you leave, the easier that will be.

If you don't remember the exact name of a method, your interviewer won't care most of the time. Don't stress about it. Just come up with a reasonably close-enough name for it. If they ask what it does, just say: &ldquo;I could be mistaken about the name here, but this method creates an inverted version of a hash map so the unique values now point to their keys.&rdquo; Most interviewers will be satisfied with that.

Name your variables descriptively, but keep them short. It's going to suck to write long variable names repeatedly without autocomplete.

As you're writing, abstract away as much logic as you can into helper functions. This is a tremendously useful whiteboarding optimization.

Just invoke the helper functions as you go and don't feel the need to write their declarations immediately. Just say: &ldquo;I'll write this function afterward, but this just returns a hash table mapping each character in the string to its frequency.&rdquo;

Go ahead and keep working through your main function, and worry about the helpers later. This will keep you in your flow and will make it easier to read and reason about your code.

After you finish and establish the characteristics of your primary function's logic, oftentimes your interviewer will trust that you can write some of the helpers and won't want to watch you code them.

Just say: &ldquo;so this helper function does [blah blah blah]. Do you want me to write this as well?&rdquo; If they say yes, go ahead and write all your helper functions out. But this at least gives them the chance to say no. This optimization alone ended up saving me a lot of time across my interviews.

Finally, once you've finished all of the code, review everything. Just say &ldquo;okay, let me review this now.&rdquo; Read your code from top to bottom and ensure it makes sense. Follow it as though you had a debugger, actually tracing the path and transformations of an input. Fix any obvious mistakes. Then start inspecting for edge cases.

Most common edge cases: the input is null/empty, the input is 0 or size 0, the input is 1 or size 1, or the input contains duplicates. Try to suss out the assumptions you're making and see how they could be violated.

Once you're satisfied that your solution accounts for edge cases, then and only then turn to your interviewer and announce &ldquo;I believe this solves the problem.&rdquo; Make it clear that you believe you're done.

Now go ahead and analyze the algorithm. Announce the time complexity and space complexity of your solution. Talk about any tradeoffs you might be able to make. &ldquo;If you wanted to take O(n^3) time, then you could just memoize all the answers and return them in O(1) time for subsequent queries. But that comes at a big up-front time and space cost.&rdquo;

### Assorted Heuristics

This is kind of dumb, but I thought I'd include this because people seem to find it helpful.

If you're blanking during an interview, try these rules of thumb, roughly in order of usefulness:

1. Try hash maps.
2. If your problem fundamentally breaks down to searching for something, consider binary search.
3. Try sorting your input.
4. Can you break the problem down into sub-problems? Does solving the problem for size (N â€“ 1) make solving it for size N any easier? If so, try to solve recursively and/or with dynamic programming.
5. If you have a lot of strings, try putting them in a prefix tree.
6. Any time you repeatedly have to take the min or max of a dynamic collection, think heaps. (If you don't need to insert random elements, prefer a sorted array.)

Okay, so the interview is finally over. Now it's time to ask your interviewer questions. This part, too, is surprisingly important.

### Grill Your Interviewers

A common trope people throw around is &ldquo;you're interviewing them as much as they're interviewing you.&rdquo; I say if that's true, then put them through the goddamn wringer.

Ask them why they decided to join the company. Ask them what they think the company could improve at. Ask them about a time that they messed up and how it was handled. Ask them how they see themselves growing at this company in the next few years. Ask them what they wish someone would have told them before they joined. Ask them if they ever think about leaving, and if they were to leave, where they would go.

To be clear, these are not necessarily questions about the company. They are questions *about your interviewer*.

I advocate grilling your interviewer for a few reasons:

* Your interviewer is likely representative of the people you'll be working with if you join. You should learn as much as possible about the kind of people who work here.
* It's going to give you a lot more insight into the company than any generic question will.
* It gives you some momentum in the interview. Instead of constantly being on the defensive, by asking tough questions, you get some time to breathe while your interviewer reacts to your questions.
* It's also just more interesting!

That said, you will probably have some burning questions you actually want to ask your specific interviewer, like &ldquo;How did you get into data engineering?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What are your feelings on the company's transition toward service-oriented architecture?&rdquo;

That leads me to my second piece of advice when it comes to grilling interviewers.

Most of the time you won't have snappy, specific questions to ask. So memorize a set of questions and ask them again and again. Not just for different companies&mdash;literally ask successive interviewers at the same company the exact same thing.

Why?

Because for one, interviewers usually solicit questions at the end of an interview. By then there's a good chance you'll be psychologically drained and won't feel like coming up with novel, incisive questions.

(Never, ever, ever say &ldquo;I have no questions.&rdquo; Be interested!)

Second, interviewers don't compare notes on which questions a candidate asked them. So if you have a good set of questions, nobody at the company will know you asked the same questions.

Third, even if they did, they wouldn't care. Good questions are still good questions, and it's worthwhile to hear different people's answers to the same good question. I've learned a lot about different companies' dynamics this way.

### Be Excited

This is the final point I want to make, and it applies to your entire interview process.

Be excited about the company. It's trite, but it makes a huge difference. Be excited to interview. Be excited to learn about what your interviewer does and the prospect of getting to work with them. Tell them how much you like the people you met and that you dig the culture.

Interviewing is surprisingly like dating. Your interviewer is disproportionately more likely to be excited about you if you're excited about them. That positivity will make them more want to work with you, and even go to bat for you when it comes decision time.

Not only that, but excitement is a signal that you actually want to do the job they're hiring you for, and that you're going to work your ass off to do it well. If your interview performance was anywhere near the edge, your excitement may end up pushing you over the finish line.

You'll likely be interviewing at different companies, but you should always talk about what makes this company unique and captivating. If you're not sure, just ask your interviewers&mdash;what makes them love working here? You can then reflect back that answer.

At the same time, you don't want to appear desperate. I liked using the phrase &ldquo;looking for good mutual fit.&rdquo; You want to be discriminating, but you also want to seem winnable if they make you the right offer. If you seem outright disinterested in the company, then they probably won't want to make you an offer even if you pass their technical bar.

Companies do vary significantly in culture. But a lot of &ldquo;culture fit&rdquo; really just comes down to a simple question: would your interviewers actually want to be your colleague?

It's much easier for them to say yes if you sound excited. So make it easy for them.

title: The Myth of the Feel Player
tags: [poker]
image: moustache_hbndgf.jpg
---

There is a vague and shadowy mythology surrounding the Feel Player. He is a genius of mysterious origins. No one can explain how or why he is good at poker&mdash;not even the Feel Player himself. He is like a mathematical prodigy hailing from a tiny, illiterate village in India, or a low-born squire who pulls a mythical sword from its pedestal. He is a fluke, an exception. He is not supposed to be great, yet somehow he is.

Perhaps it is his impossibility that so excites us. Or perhaps it is the dream that he offers&mdash;that we, too, could be great like him. By telling ourselves the story of the Feel Player, we drop our business cards into an imaginary lottery. What, in the end, could be more democratic, more reassuring, more feel-good than the possibility of the Feel Player?

I am here to assure you, gentle reader, that the notion of a Feel Player is a myth.

In this article, we will examine the concept of a Feel Player, what it can tell us about cognition and unconscious competence, how Feel Players evolve (or don't), and why the concept of the Feel Player can be so detrimental to students of poker.

First, let's try to begin, unlike the Feel Player, unsensationally&mdash;what, properly defined, is this mysterious player?

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VfCSx5641U4">[video]</div>

## What is a Feel Player?

The hallmark of the Feel Player is in the way he justifies his plays. When you ask a Feel Player why he made a bluff, he'll answer, &ldquo;it felt right.&rdquo; When you ask him why he folded the second-nuts, he'll say, &ldquo;I felt like he had it.&rdquo; The origins of his answers are a mystery. Where the rest of us invoke combinatorials, betting logics and notes we've taken, the Feel Player invokes the god in his head.

But somehow&mdash;awesomely&mdash;the god in his head is usually right.

There are many poker players who have, for me, embodied the myth of the Feel Player. Personally, I have always seen Ilari Sahamies (Ziigmund) as the foremost exemplar of this phenomenon. Of course, there are many others. And while I have seen many Feel Players come and go, few have lasted the test of time.

There is a common belief is that Feel Players have a different and unique style of thinking. I.e., some players are analytical and theory-heavy, whereas others are intuitive and feel-heavy. &ldquo;Feel&rdquo; is seen as merely a thinking style, like the difference between auditory and visual learning.

&ldquo;Feel&rdquo;, then, is shorthand for intuition&mdash;pure unconscious competence. We've talked about this concept before in previous chapters, but let's look at it in a little more detail.

## Feel and Consciousness

As previously stated, there are four phases of learning in the process of mastering any skill:

1. unconscious incompetence (inattentively being bad)
2. conscious incompetence (attentively being bad)
3. conscious competence (attentively being good)
4. unconscious competence (inattentively being good)

In a simple task, you can progress uniformly from one stage to the next. But poker is an extremely complex game. Instead of thinking of poker as a single skill to be optimized from stages one to four, we should think of ability in poker as comprising *many* different skills&mdash;innumerably many&mdash;each of which is at a different stage in these phases of learning. Because poker is so intricate and incorporates so many different situations and types of reasoning, even the best players in the world will have some parts of their game that have not passed on to the stage of unconscious competence.

Consider **&ldquo;autopilot&rdquo;**. In poker, what we call autopilot is another way of referring to the entirety of your unconscious competence&mdash;your poker &ldquo;muscle memory,&rdquo; so to speak. When you are autopiloting, you are essentially restricted to only your poker skills that are unconsciously mastered&mdash;skills in the fourth stage of mastery. Everything that is not mastered to that level (that is, skills in which you are only consciously competent) will be suddenly missing from your game. So if, when you autopilot, your flop checkraising game vanishes, this tells you that your flop checkraising game is still not yet mastered to the level of unconscious competence. Although autopiloting is often seen as a bad thing, it is invaluable for elucidating which parts of your game are completely automatic&mdash;and, by implication, which parts are not. So when we are *not* autopiloting&mdash;when we are playing our **A-game**&mdash;there is a thread of conscious chatter that's running through our heads. This conscious thread is what gives us access to all of our consciously competent poker skills. The goal, then, is *not* to remove all of the chatter from your mind. This is somewhat unlike other activities, such as juggling or dancing, in which the goal is to &ldquo;get out of your head&rdquo; and &ldquo;just be in the moment.&rdquo; The chatter we experience when playing good poker is essential for invoking the skills in which we have only conscious competence.

The neurological difference between conscious and unconscious processes is not well understood, but experiments have demonstrated that the difference is real and crucial to managing performance. Consider, for example, driving your car to work in the morning, compared to driving your car on the motorway in a thunderstorm. On a normal day you drive very inattentively, perhaps listening to music, or talking to a passenger. But during a thunderstorm you probably turn the music down, lean forward in your seat, and are fully focused on the task. By fully attending to your driving, you recruit all of the subtlety and attention you can to your handling of the car. Things like fine handling, reactionary decision-making, and adjusting your speed to weather and visibility conditions are skills that most drivers *don't* have unconsciously mastered. We intuitively recognize this, and adjust our concentration levels according to the needs (and dangers) of the task at hand.

But perhaps you might argue that poker is a very mental game&mdash;it's not a physical activity like playing tennis or driving a car. How is it that such a mental game can be automated into our mental muscle memory, such that we don't even have to think about it? One process that explains this is chunking**.** Chunking is the process by which larger and larger patterns of information are condensed or &ldquo;chunked&rdquo; into single mental units. A good example of this is in the assessment of starting hands. The first time you ever played no-limit Hold'em, perhaps you looked at a hand like A7o, and processed it as &ldquo;I have an ace and a seven.&rdquo; Perhaps you considered how each of those cards could facilitate hitting a pair&mdash;a pair of 7s, or a pair of aces, and maybe you figured this to be pretty good. But now, as an experienced poker player who's been dealt thousands of A7's, you treat A7o as not two separate cards, but one distinct &ldquo;chunk&rdquo; of a hand. You think very fluidly and quickly about how A7o does against other chunked hole cards&mdash;A5, AJ, 78, etc.

The more we play poker, the more we are able to chunk bigger and more complex patterns of information into single units. As you continue to gain experience, you will start to chunk flops&mdash;such that Js8s7c will become a flop that you will play so many times, you will no longer analyze it card-by-card, but will see it as one discrete thing. And when the turn comes down 2d, a blank, you will not have to analyze that card separately either, because you know exactly how you're supposed to play with your JTo on Js8s7c+low blank. Once something is chunked, it no longer needs to be consciously analyzed, and hand processing speed increases exponentially. You're not thinking anymore &ldquo;what do I beat and what don't I beat on this board? How many hand combos are ahead of me?&rdquo; but instead, you just unconsciously &ldquo;sense&rdquo; the relative strength of your hand on this board, and play it accordingly. Once a skill becomes unconsciously competent, it is almost always chunked to a high degree. And because chunking requires a great depth of experience, the only way to reach this level of unconscious competence is by putting in thousands of hours and consciously analyzing them so many times that the analysis becomes crystallized in your chunking. Thus, that spot can eventually be dealt with as a single unconscious unit.

So when I ask you, &ldquo;why do you think A83r is a bad board to checkraise?&rdquo; you might not have an immediate answer&mdash;perhaps, for you, you just know this intuitively. It's part of your chunked sense of A83r; you &ldquo;feel&rdquo; it. But if you take a minute to think about it, you can probably retrospectively explain&mdash;&ldquo;well, if I checkraise that board I'm repping very few hands, most Axs I have will just check/call, and he has more big aces if he's raised preflop,&rdquo; and so on.

We all have some of our decisions relegated to &ldquo;feel,&rdquo; but most of us can still reproduce the theory needed to derive them again if needed. Yet according to the popular mythology, the Feel Player cannot do this.

## The Evolution of the Feel Player

So how could such a thing as a Feel Player ever arise? How could someone who doesn't theoretically analyze their hands ever become good at poker?

It's not as unlikely as you might think.

First, let us remember that poker is a **stochastic** game&mdash;that is to say, it's non-deterministic. Poker is stochastic in that it gives *partially random* feedback to your plays. E.g., if you make a *good* checkraise, your feedback might still be negative (the checkraise fails and you get punished) 30% of the time. Not only that, but there's second-level stochasticity&mdash;the checkraise might be good against 80% of players who've given off the same reads your opponent has, and bad against 20%, so even if you've made a bad checkraise against *this* player, one of the 20%, it might be good on average. Add stuff like getting sucked out and coolers, and you can see how poker gives chaotic and unreliable feedback.

But the idea we have is that the Feel Player is *purely responding**to feedback*. He is simply listening to what poker is telling him&mdash;little *yes*'s and *no*'s&mdash;and like someone learning to balance on one foot, he gradually gets better and better, with his body continually nudging him in the right direction. Perhaps this seems a little farfetched to you. Isn't poker too messy for a player like that to ever get good?

Let me provide you with a hypothetical Monte Carlo simulation. Imagine a group of 1,000,000 &ldquo;theory&rdquo; players, and one of 1,000,000 Feel Players. The theory players are, obviously, those who use poker theory to negotiate the game, whereas the Feel Players are learning purely from poker's stochastic feedback. Of course, a lot of those theory players are going to fail; maybe they're not smart enough, or they're too tilty, or just unlucky&mdash;but let's say that only 30% of them succeed as poker players. That gives us 300,000 surviving theory players. For Feel Players, on the other hand, *tons* of them are going to fail&mdash;poker is so random and their learning is so undirected, the vast majority of them will drop off like flies. But given the sheer numbers and the fact that poker might, in its random feedback, nudge some of those players into really good habits, let's say that 0.5% of them succeed. That gives us 5,000 successful Feel Players.

That's a ratio of 1:60 for Feel Players to theory players. That's a pretty lopsided ratio. But it's enough for most people to have run into many of them, and for a couple Feel Players to be prominent among the top 300 players in the world. But the &ldquo;Feel Player&rdquo; seems like a prominent phenomenon; surely there are more than 1:60, you might say.

In fact, Feel Players are overwhelmingly rare at the highest levels&mdash;we just tend to notice them a lot more. It's a sort of availability bias; they're mentally overrepresented. Theory players are everywhere. They're boring and mechanical. But Feel Players are sensational, rare, and fascinating, so we pay more attention to them. We hang on their every word, we watch them in games, and we root for them. Why? Perhaps because they are like us. Feel Players take crazy risks. They tilt. They make plays no one would ordinarily make. Just the idea of being a Feel Player, of thumbing your nose at the meticulous and boring process of poker theorizing&mdash;this is an exciting attitude in and of itself. The Feel Player appears to show us that anyone can win at poker. It doesn't take a genius, or having spent thousands of hours studying the game, or the ability to do GTO simulations or combinatorial calculations. So we follow him. We tell his story. We, in a sense, create the myth of the Feel Player.

## The Luck of the Draw

Now think, how many Feel Players do you really know of? Make a mental list. And of those, how many *are you really sure* are Feel Players, and not just players whose poker theory you don't really know much about? I'd be surprised if you knew of more than five who are still successful.

A Monte Carlo simulation can account for the existence of Feel Players. But this doesn't mean that one should take them seriously. As with any tall tale, the point isn't whether or not it actually happened. The fact is, being a Feel Player is not a reliable way to become good at poker. It's not a learning style, or a way of being. We are better off thinking of Feel Players, rather than as geniuses or heroes, as simply really, really lucky.

It's strange, I know, to call someone who is highly skilled &ldquo;lucky.&rdquo; We reserve that word generally for people who are ostensibly bad. But in fact, if you are looking at the top 0.1% of Feel Players&mdash;the ones who are successful&mdash;their getting conditioned by poker in the exact right way to produce good habits was purely a matter of luck. It was out of their hands. Even though they may now be good, solid, consistent cash game players, they still may have been just as lucky as a first-time fish who binks a bracelet, depending on the EV and unlikelihood of those events. Feel Players have no control over their development. They don't &ldquo;choose&rdquo; to get good. They may *happen* to become good, but if you took 100 simulations of their life, with all of the decisions that they made held constant, they would succeed in only one, whereas a theory player might succeed in 20 of them.

And that is also why Feel Players as a race are going extinct. You don't hear as much about them now as you used to. This is because Feel Players in general have very short lifespans. After all, if your conditioning and learning was mostly random, what makes you think it's going to continue to keep up with evolving games? In that sense, Feel Players are much like comets. They may burn brightly for a time, and that draws our eye to them, but they go out just as fast and foolishly as they arrived. This is not to mention that the chance of a Feel Player reaching the highest levels is becoming more and more unlikely, as poker continues to get harder and more players are employing complex strategies guided by game theory and exploitation. Strategies that you could've stumbled into three years ago and taken a run at high stakes with are now not enough to break even in $2/$4 games.

Poker is changing. The fact that you're reading this article probably means that you're on the right side of that change. It was merely 10 years ago that basic poker conversations we have nowadays would've been scoffed at as reductionistic, nonsensical, or &ldquo;not what the game is about.&rdquo;

Don't get me wrong. I'm not suggesting that intuition is not important, or that &ldquo;feel&rdquo; doesn't play a role in most of our decisions. It absolutely does. There are many things that our unconscious minds are better at processing than our conscious minds will ever be. Theory can only do so much; it is slow, lumbering, and we often have no time to work through the full calculations in a hand before we must make a decision. Further, there are games like PLO, which can become so complex that it's impossible to do EV simulations in many flop scenarios. We are always navigating poker unconsciously, and often &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; out the terrain with our guts before our brains. But we must also remember that, as poker players, we are tasked with the responsibility of doing *everything we possibly can* to become good. Poker, rake, and randomness are all working against us. Nothing is in our favor. So we must enlist every tool at our disposal&mdash;theory being perhaps the strongest. All theory players use feel; without it, they would be uselessly slow. But properly oriented, theory is like the charioteer, directing the raw and wild power of feel.

One of the greatest benefits of theory, after all, is its ability to reduce the stochasticity of poker feedback. Without theory, you might be conditioned not to make that checkraise again&mdash;but with a solid understanding of theory, you may realize that even though this hand gave you a *no*, solid theory will reassure you that it was really a wider *yes* in the long run. Thus, you don't swallow the randomness and noise that poker is feeding you, and instead you shape your game closer to the real mechanics of poker. Feel is like a wild horse, dragging you every which way, and it is up to theory to tame it and keep yourself on course. Thus without theory, your learning is at the mercy of far more chaos (not to mention cognitive biases).

In reality, there are probably no true Feel Players at high stakes anymore. The binary I initially presented is a bit of a fantasy&mdash;rather than theory versus feel, it's really &ldquo;theory and feel,&rdquo; in constant orbit of one another. In reality, every serious, modern-day poker player has *some* idea of theory that's guiding his play. Some, like Ilari perhaps, just have relatively less compared to their peers. Inevitably, these things are hard to quantify, and in truth, a lot of it is probably just perception. Perhaps Ilari is a theory player, and just doesn't seem that way&mdash;or hides it. I would never know. But whoever is or isn't a feel player is beside the point. The point is. feel is not a learning style. Feel is ubiquitous, and necessary for every poker player, and always has been. But it's a cop-out. It's the luck of the draw. It is not a reliable way to become good.

So you know the [first 6 rules](https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/). You've maneuvered through the initial offer conversation, you've lined up counteroffers from other companies, and now it's time to move into the actual negotiating.

Naturally, this is the part where everything goes horribly wrong.

But worry not. Stick with me, and I'm going to make you into a superhuman negotiator. (Or at least an eccentric billionaire negotiator, which is sometimes better?)

Seriously though. In this article I'm going to deep dive on the whole negotiating process, and discuss the final 4 rules on how to negotiate a job offer.

Right. Let's start from the top.

What does it take to be a good negotiator?

Most people think negotiating well is just looking the other person in the eye, appearing confident, and asking for tons of money. But being a good negotiator is a lot more subtle than that.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7hYKw-hL6OM/">[video]</div>

## What Good Negotiators Sound Like

You probably have a friend or family member who's infamous for refusing to take no for an answer. The kind of person who will march into a department store and bullheadedly argue with the management until they get a purchase refunded.

This person seems like they often get what they want. They make you cringe, but perhaps you should try to be more like them.

Rest assured, this person is actually a terrible negotiator. They're good at being difficult and causing a scene, which can sometimes convince a waitress or shift manager to appease them. But this style of negotiating will get you nowhere when negotiating with a business partner (that is, an employer).

A good negotiator is empathetic and collaborative. They don't try to control you or issue ultimatums. Rather, they try to think creatively about how to fulfill both your and their needs.

So when you think of negotiating a job offer, don't imagine haggling over a used car. Think more like negotiating dinner plans with a group of friends, and you'll fare much better.

## Slicing up the cake

Another important difference between good and bad negotiators is that bad negotiators tend to think of a negotiation as a zero-sum game.

Imagine we're negotiating over a cake. In a zero-sum negotiation if I get one more slice, you get one less. Any gain I make comes at your expense.

This seems obviously true with cake, right? So what makes a job negotiation any different?

Ah, but it's not actually true for cake. What if I hate corner pieces and you love them? What if I really like the cherries? What if I prefer to scrape off some of the frosting, but you love extra frosting? What if I'm full and you're starving, but you'll agree to treat me to my favorite cake next time?

Of course, when I posed the question I didn't mention anything about cherries or my feelings on corner pieces. It might seem like I just made shit up.

But this is exactly what good negotiators do. They bend the rules. They question assumptions and ask unexpected questions. They dig to find the core what everyone values and looks for creative ways to widen the terrain of negotiation.

While you were thinking about how to haggle over slices, I'm thinking about how to give both of us more than just half of a cake.

Different parties in a negotiation almost always have different value functions. We may value the *same* things&mdash;we both care about cake, after all. But we we don't value them in exactly the same way, so there's probably a way to give each of us more of what we want.

Most people go into a job negotiation thinking they need to stubbornly haggle over salary like slices of cake. They don't ever stop to ask&mdash;hey, what do I actually value? Why do I value it? What does the company value? Why do they value that?

There are many dimensions in a job negotiation: salary, signing bonus, stock, a year-end or performance bonus, commuter benefits, relocation expenses, equipment, an educational stipend, a childcare stipend, extra vacation time, a later start date, getting a dedicated hour a day to work out or study or meditate or play solitaire. You could choose which team you're assigned to, what your first project will be, what technologies you'll be working with, and sometimes even choose your title.

Maybe you're a frosting person, and the company is more into cherries. You never know if you don't ask.

Hold onto this mindset.

Okay.

Let's pick up the negotiation where we left off. All the offers are in, and recruiters are eagerly awaiting for you to get the ball rolling.

Let's start negotiating.

## Phone vs Email

Your first decision is whether you're going to negotiate over the phone or keep it over e-mail.

Talking on the phone not only signals confidence, but more importantly, it allows you to build a strong relationship with your recruiter.

Talking on the phone enables bantering, telling jokes, and building connection. You want your recruiter to like you, understand you, empathize with you, and want you to succeed. Likewise, you want to care about your recruiter and understand what's motivating them.

The best deals get made between friends. It's hard to make friends over e-mail.

However, if you don't have confidence in your negotiation skills, you should try to push the negotiation to e-mail. Written, asynchronous communication will give you more time to strategize and make it easier to say uncomfortable things without being pressured by a recruiter.

That said, recruiters will always prefer to get you on the phone. It's essentially their home turf. They're also well aware that negotiating is easier over e-mail, and they have little interest in making it easier on you. They'll often be vague about the offer over e-mail and only offer to discuss specific details on the phone.

If you want to stick to email, you have to push back against this. There's no secret to it: just be honest and ask for what you want.

Tell them:

> Hi recruiter, I hope your day is treating you well!
>
> Re: your previous e-mail, I'd prefer to discuss the details of the offer over e-mail. I sometimes get nervous during important phone calls, so discussing the offer over e-mail helps me to keep a clear head and communicate more clearly. I hope this is okay with you. :)

No bullshit, no huff-puffery. Just telling the truth and asking for what you want.

There's tremendous power in honesty and directness. Take advantage of it.

(Also, note how I wrote &ldquo;discuss the details of the offer&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;negotiate.&rdquo; Never describe what you're doing as negotiating&mdash;that sounds immediately adversarial and haggley. Describe it instead as a discussion, and they're less likely to recoil.)

## Having Alternatives

I mentioned before how essential it is to have multiple offers. I'll reiterate again&mdash;it's very, very valuable to have multiple offers.

With other offers on the table, if your negotiation doesn't work out, they know you'll just accept another offer. Your negotiating position suddenly becomes a lot more credible because they know you're willing to walk away.

This effect is strengthened if you get an offer from a prestigious company. And the effect goes through the roof if you have an offer from a company's primary competitor (now they'll really want to poach you from the big bad competitor-corp).

Some of this behavior is stupid tribalism. And some part of it is rational in trying to deprive competitors of talent. Either way, take advantage of it, and be tactical in which companies you aim for.

But what if you don't manage to get any other offers? Does all the negotiating just go out the window?

Not at all. What's important here is not actually having other offers. More specifically, it's in having strong alternatives. Which is why **Rule #6 of negotiating is: have alternatives.**

A negotiation needs stakes. If there were no risk and you knew for sure the other side would sign a contract, what incentive would you have to offer them anything more?

Your alternatives are what give a negotiation its stakes. By signaling your alternatives, you allow your interlocutor to develop a mental model of when and why you'll walk away from the negotiation. Your alternatives also have an anchoring effect on how much the other side thinks you're objectively worth.

In negotiation literature, your best alternative is often referred to as your BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement). Basically, it's what you'd do if you walked away.

I like the term BATNA a lot, mostly because it sounds like a gadget Batman would lob at bad guys.

So what's your BATNA if you don't have other offers? Do you even have one?

Of course you do. Your best alternative might be &ldquo;interview at more companies&rdquo; or &ldquo;go to grad school&rdquo; or &ldquo;stay at your current job&rdquo; or &ldquo;go on sabbatical in Morocco for a few months&rdquo; (as it was for a friend of mine who was deliberating between joining a startup and gallivanting through North Africa).

The point is, you don't need to have another offer to have a strong BATNA. *Your BATNA's strength comes from 1) how strong the other side perceives it to be, and 2) how strong you perceive it to be.*

If your recruiter thinks that going to grad school is an awesome thing to do, then they'll see you as having a very strong alternative, and the stakes of the negotiation will be raised.

But even if they think grad school is ridiculous, if you convince them that you'd be totally happy to go to grad school, then the burden is on them to make this deal more attractive to you than going to grad school.

Thus, *you need to communicate your BATNA*. This doesn't need to be ham-fisted, but you need to make it a background to the negotiation. (Note: usually whenever you signal your BATNA, you should also re-emphasize your interest in reaching an agreement).

Examples:

> I've received another offer from [OTHER CORP] that's very compelling on salary, but I really love the mission of [YOUR COMPANY] and think that it would overall be a better fit for me.
>
> I'm also considering going back to grad school and getting a Master's degree in Postmodern Haberdashery. I'm excited about [YOUR COMPANY] though and would love to join the team, but the package has to make sense if I'm going to forego a life of ironic hatmaking.

Note: one of the biggest mistakes I see here is from people who are currently working. If you already have a job, staying where you are is often your BATNA.

This means if you tell your interlocutor that you hate your job, then they know your BATNA sucks, and have no incentive to negotiate with you (on top of potentially thinking that you're a negative person). Always emphasize the pros of your current company, your seniority, your impact, and whatever else you like about where you currently work.

*You should make your decision seem genuinely close for it to be a strong BATNA.*

## What a Job Negotiation Means to an Employer

I've kept saying that to be an effective negotiator you need to understand the other side. So let's take a look at what it's like to negotiate as an employer. (I'm going to have to use the tech industry in my examples here; the details will differ by industry.)

First, we have to rewind and understand what brought us to this offer in the first place. What kind of resources have they spent so far in trying to fill this position?

* Writing and posting a job description on all appropriate channels ($300)
* Reviewing ~100 or more resumes ($1250)
* About 15% of those resumes need to be phone screened, so roughly 15 phone screens ($2250)
* Around 75% of those initial phone screens warrant a technical screen, so roughly 11 technical screens ($9000)
* About 30% pass through to an on-site, so roughly 3 onsites. These onsites require the coordination of 6-7 employees ($10800)
* Finally, they make one offer. The recruiter (and potentially the executive staff) need to spend time on the phone with the offeree convincing and negotiating. ($900)

<p class="note">Numbers nabbed from <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-average-cost-of-recruiting-an-engineer-in-Silicon-Valley/answer/Rick-Brownlow?srid=tvlO">here</a>.</p>

All-in-all this process took about 45 days from start to finish.

Now say you end up turning down their offer. They've spent over $24,000 just extending this single offer to you (to say nothing of opportunity costs), and now they'll essentially have to start over from scratch.

This is what a company faces if you turn them down.

Realize what a gauntlet they've been through!

Realize how important it is that you're the one!

Out of the droves and droves who've shown up on their doorstep, *you're* the one they want. They want to usher you into their tribe. They went through so much crap to get you here, and now they've found you.

And you're worried that if you negotiate, they'll take it away?

Further yet, understand that salary is only one part of the cost of employing you. An employer also has to pay for your benefits, your equipment, space, utilities, other random expenses, and employment taxes on top of all of that. All-in, [your actual salary often comprises less than 50% of the total cost of employing you](http://web.mit.edu/e-club/hadzima/pdf/how-much-does-an-employee-cost.pdf).

(Which means they expect that your value to the company, in terms of the revenue you'll generate, to be more than 2x your salary. If they didn't believe that, they wouldn't be hiring you at all.)

So, this is all to say: everything is stacked in your favor. It doesn't feel that way, but it absolutely is.

Realize that when you are agonizing over whether to ask for another few thousand dollars, what they're doing is praying with bated breath that you'll sign the offer.

If you don't sign the offer, they lose. Losing a good candidate sucks. No one wants to believe that their company isn't worth working for.

They want to win. They will pay to win.

And yet, you might worry: &ldquo;but if end up negotiating more, won't they have higher expectations? Won't my boss end up hating me for negotiating?&rdquo;

**No, and no.**

It's your role that will determine your performance expectations, not how much you negotiated. Making 5k more or less in salary doesn't matter at all. Your manager will literally just not care about this.

Remember how expensive it is to even employ you in the first place! Nobody's going to fire you because you're performing 5K worse than they expected you to; the cost of firing you and hiring someone else is a lot more than 5K to begin with.

And no, your boss won't hate you now. And in fact, at most big companies the person you're negotiating with won't even be your boss. Recruiting and management are totally separate departments, completely abstracted from one another. And even if you're at a startup, trust me that your boss is used to negotiating with candidates and doesn't put nearly as much significance in it as you do.

In short: negotiating is easier and more normal than you think, and companies are completely willing to negotiate with you. If your intuition tells you otherwise, trust that your mental model is wrong.

## How to Give the First Number

In [part 1](https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/), I mentioned how valuable it is not to have to give the first number. But there are times when you can't avoid it. In that case, there are ways to give the first number without giving the first number.

If a company asks you &ldquo;what are your salary expectations?&rdquo; you might say:

> I don't have any particular numbers in mind. I'm more interested in learning whether this will be a good mutual fit. If it is, I'm open to exploring any offer so long as it's competitive.

Sounds good. But they push back,

> I understand that, but we need to have a clear idea of what you think is competitive. I need to know whether it's worth going through the interview process. We're a young startup, so I need to make sure we're on the same page as far as compensation.

That's a strong push. But you can still push back.

> I completely hear you, and I agree it's important that we're on the same page. I really have no particular numbers in my head, it all depends on the fit and the composition of the offer. Once we decide we want to work together, I think that's the best time to figure out a compensation package that makes sense.

Most employers will relent here. But there's a small chance they push further:

> Okay, look, you're being difficult. Let's not waste each other's time. What's an offer that you'd be willing to take?

This is a decision point. They're trying to take away your negotiating power and pin you to a premature decision.

That said, you probably will have to say a number at this point, or risk damaging the trust in this relationship. (They *are* making a valid point that startups can't offer the same kind of cash as large companies, nor should you expect them to. They might be sensing that you're not aware of this.)

But you can give a number here without actually giving a number.

> Well, okay. I know that the average software engineer in Silicon Valley makes roughly 120K a year salary. So I think that's a good place to start.

Notice what I did here. I didn't actually answer the question &ldquo;what's an offer you'd be willing to take,&rdquo; I merely anchored the conversation around the fulcrum of &ldquo;the average software engineer salary.&rdquo;

So if you're forced to give a number, do so by appealing to an objective metric, such as an industry average (or your current salary). And make it clear that you're merely starting the negotiation there, not ending it.

## How to Ask for More

Say an offer is out there, and now you want to improve it. As always, be direct and ask for what you want. Here are generally the steps you should take.

First, reiterate your interest in the company. This is as simple as:

> I'm really excited about the problems you guys are working on at Evil Corp&hellip;

Now frame why you're asking for more. There are two choices here: you can say that you're on the fence and that an improvement might convince you, or you can go stronger and say that you're outright dissatisfied with the offer. Which approach you choose depends on how much leverage you have, how weak the offer is relative to your BATNA, and whether you have other offers (the weaker your negotiating position, generally the more tentative you should be).

Either way, be unfailingly polite.

If you're dissatisfied with the offer, you might say something like:

> I appreciate the work you guys put into constructing this offer. But there were a couple things I was unsatisfied with.

If you want to be more reserved, you can say something like:

> The offer you guys extended was strong. Right now my decision is basically between you and [XYZ CORP]. It's a genuinely difficult decision for me, but there are a couple of dimensions where, if this offer improved, it would be much more compelling.

Don't just say something like:

> Thanks for the offer. Here are some ways I think it could improve.

This makes you sound like an ass. Be polite, and if you want to strengthen the offer, tell them clearly how you feel about it. This builds trust and conveys seriousness.

Let's say you want to raise the salary. Now that you have a specific ask, it's time to employ **rule #7: proclaim reasons for everything.**

We all implicitly know the catch-22 of negotiation: if you say you want more salary, you'll sound greedy. And no one likes greedy people, right? So why would they want to give more money to a greedy person?

I suspect this is the primary reason why so many candidates recoil from negotiating. They don't want to *feel* greedy. It goes against all of their social conditioning. And yet, there are some situations in which most people would be totally fine negotiating.

Specifically, *when they have to.*

If you *had* to raise your salary or you wouldn't be able to afford rent, or if you had to negotiate health insurance to cover a medical condition, you'd negotiate without a twinge of regret. The difference? That you have a *reason* for what you're requesting.

It's kind of a brain-hack, both for yourself and for your negotiating partner. Just stating a reason&mdash;any reason&mdash;makes your request feel human and important. It's not you being greedy, it's you trying to fulfill your goals.

The more unobjectionable and sympathetic your reason, the better. If it's medical expenses, or paying off student loans, or taking care of family, you'll bring tears to their eyes. I told employers that I was earning-to-give, so since I was donating 33% of my income to charity, I had negotiate aggressively to leave myself enough to live off.

But honestly, even if your reason is inane and unimpressive, it will still carry this effect.

Just saying &ldquo;can you improve the salary?&rdquo; sounds like you're boringly motivated by money. But if you say &ldquo;I really want to buy a house within the next year; what can we do to improve the salary?&rdquo; this suddenly seems a lot more legitimate.

If they turn down your request now, they're implicitly telling you &ldquo;no Jennifer, you can't buy your house. I guess you don't deserve one.&rdquo; No one wants to do that. They want to be the one who says &ldquo;Alright Jennifer, I talked with the director and I made it happen. You're getting that new house!&rdquo;

Of course, it goes without saying that the reason you want money is so that you can spend it on things. What do they think you're going to use it for, toilet paper?

I know. It's stupid. It's really stupid, but it works.

Just go with it, state a reason for everything, and you'll find recruiters more willing to become your advocate.

## Assert your Value

One effective move you can make in a negotiation, especially after an ask, is to emphasize the unique value you'll be bringing to the company. Example:

> Blah blah blah, I want X, Y, and Z.
>
> I know that you guys are looking for someone to build out your Android team. I believe I bring a lot of experience leading a team of Android developers and I'm confident that I'll be able to bring your mobile offerings up to parity with your competitors.
>
> Let me know your thoughts.

Be confident without boasting or trying to hold yourself specific metrics (unless you're supremely confident). Whatever you assert should be something you've touched on earlier in your discussions, but it's okay to repeat it now as a gentle reminder. It reminds them of the carrot and shows that you're still excited to add value.

This is not appropriate in every negotiation, especially for very junior positions, where it's harder to differentiate yourself. But later in your career (or for more specialized/consulting roles) this can be a really valuable nudge.

## What to Ask For

This brings me to **rule #8: be motivated by more than just money.** Note, this is not code for &ldquo;if you seem like you're motivated by more than just money, you'll get more money.&rdquo;

There is no bigger turn-off to a company than somebody who only cares about money. This is something you're not going to be able to fake.

*Actually be motivated by other things.* You should be motivated by money too of course, but it should be one among many dimensions you're optimizing for. How much training you get, what your first project will be, which team you join, or even who your mentor will be&mdash;these are all things you can and should negotiate.

Among these factors, salary is perhaps the least important.

What do you really value? Be creative. Don't try to haggle over slices of cake when there's so much more on the table.

Of course, to negotiate well you need to understand the other side's preferences. You want to make the deal better for *both of you.* That's why **rule #9 is: understand what the company values.**

How do you figure this out? Well, there are a few good rules of thumb.

First, salary is almost always the hardest thing to give, for a few reasons.

1. It must be paid year after year, so it becomes part of a company's long-term burn rate.
2. It is almost always the thing that people gossip about, so paying someone significantly more salary can cause unrest.
3. It tends to be the most tightly constrained by pay bands, especially at large companies.

So if you want more financial compensation, you should think about structuring as much of it as possible outside of salary. A signing bonus, for example, is easier to give than salary. A signing bonus has the advantage of only needing to be paid once, it gets the candidate excited about joining (because everyone likes wads of cash), and it's generally not as public.

Remember that you can always get salary raises as you continue to work at the company, but there's only one point at which you can get a signing bonus.

The easiest thing for a company to give though is stock (if the company offers stock). Companies like giving stock because it invests you in the company and aligns interests. It also shifts some of the risk from the company over to you and burns less cash.

If you are genuinely risk-neutral or early in your career, then you should generally try to assume as much stock as possible. If you aggressively trade cash for stock, you can end up with a higher expected value offer (albeit with higher risk).

## A Brief Primer on Equity

You can skip this section if you're already pretty familiar with how equity works. I'm going to speaking to the totally uninitiated here, because too many people get swindled when it comes to valuing stock.

First, understand there are two completely different classes of companies: public companies and private companies. If the company is public (i.e., it has IPOed and is listed on the stock market), then its stock is as good as cash. You will usually be granted RSUs (Restricted Stock Units), which are just shares like you can purchase on the stock market. Once these shares vest (that is, are released to you), you can turn around and sell them on the stock market. This is how they turn into money.

If the company is private, then things get a lot more complicated. For private companies, most of the time they will not actually issue you stock grants. Usually, they will issue you stock options. An option is a pre-agreed right to purchase shares of stock at a frozen price.

It's important to note that when you want to leave a company, if you have options, your life becomes really complicated. You may have to pay a bunch of money to actually exercise your option (that is, buy your pre-agreed upon stock at the previous frozen price, or risk losing it), with no way to actually sell it yet. The only way to truly liquidate your options is when the company IPOs or is acquired. And many companies don't ever do either.

Thus, options are very risky. It's easier to get screwed by options, especially on tax implications. For a lot more information, see [this post](http://a16z.com/2016/08/24/options-ownership/) by Scott Kupor of a16z.

## Equity Shenanigans

Many companies will try to play mindgames with you when it comes to equity. Several companies pulled these on me.

A common one is presenting the total value of the stock grant rather than the annualized value, despite the the stock not vesting evenly, or vesting over 5 years instead of the standard 4.

But the most egregious thing that companies will do is tell you absurd stories about the value of their stock. They'll say: &ldquo;okay, we're worth this much now, but at the rate we're growing we're going to be worth 10X that in a year. So really, the value of your options is many millions of dollars!&rdquo;

To not mince words: this is cynically dishonest bullshit. Don't buy it even for a second. I got this a few times, and the only reason I didn't walk away from the offer immediately was because it was always a recruiter pulling this crap. If it was a manager I would've turned down the offer outright.

Here's why this is infuriatingly stuptags: [a company's valuation is determined by investors. These investors see the financials and the growth rate of the company, and invest at a price that **reflects the current growth rate of the company.** In other words, they invested at a valuation that already took their 10x growth rate into account. Investors are not idiots. And unless you (or your recruiter) think you have privileged information or insight that the company's investors don't, you should probably take the investors' word for it.

(Not to mention a company's nominal valuation is almost always inflated due to preferred shares, debt, and survivorship bias, but let's ignore that for now.)

So if a company gives you this hock of crap, fire back and tell them thank you, but you'll be considering the stock at the same valuation their investors valued it at.

I mean, be nice. But don't let them try to strong-arm you into accepting this garbage.

A job is not a suicide pact. Choose a company that is judicious and transparent, and you'll be much more likely to find yourself respected and taken care of.

## Other Things You Can Ask For

Because I'd be remiss if I didn't point out a few other things.

Relocation expenses often come out of separate budgets at big companies, so this is generally very easy to get.

Look for creative benefits that would be particularly valuable to you. Maybe it's covering your commuter expenses, asking for dedicated volunteer or learning time, getting sponsored for conferences, or even charity donation matching.

Don't assume anything's off the table until you've tried bringing it up.

That said, don't throw the entire kitchen sink at them. A negotiation can quickly become cumbersome for an employer if you bring up a litany of changes. Keep the changeset as pithy as you can.

## Negotiating Jiu Jitsu

Recruiters love trying to trick you into ending the negotiation early. They're going to do this relentlessly. Don't fault them for it&mdash;I suspect they can't help themselves.

Just keep breaking out of their shenanigans, and don't let yourself be pressured into ending a negotiation until you're actually ready to make a final decision. This is especially grave if you have multiple offers, and you let one company pressure you into canceling the others. Companies succeed in doing this all the time, so I want to equip you with the skills to jiu jitsu out of these techniques.

Here are two situations you can break out of. (These are both real situations that happened to me during my negotiations, though the numbers and details are invented.)

### Situation 1:

I ask for a 10K increase in signing bonus. The company gets back to me and says,

> That's really tough for us to do. I'm going to try, I think you're worth it, but I can't really go to my boss and fight for you unless she knows you're going to sign. Are you going to sign if I get you that 10K?

You should be thinking: ah, this person is trying to force me to a decision point and take away my negotiating power.

I respond:

> Okay, so what I'm hearing is that you'll have to expend some personal reputation to get me a 10K bonus. If you end up going to bat for me, are you confident you'll be able to get that 10K?

They respond:

>I think I can, it just comes down to you Haseeb. If you're serious about joining us, then I'll go fight for you. But I need to know for sure you'll sign.

Great. Time to Jiu Jitsu.

> That makes sense. Unfortunately I can't commit to signing yet; I'm not yet at the stage where I can make a final decision. Like I told you before, this weekend I'm going to sit down with my family and talk things over with them. Choosing the company I'm going to spend the next few years at is a commitment I take really seriously, and so I want to be sure I'm making a well-considered decision.

> But since you're confident that you can get an extra 10K, let's do this instead: in my mind, I'll pretend this offer is [X + 10K] and as I'm considering my final decision, that's where I'll value it. I know it's tough for you to go and get that from your boss, so I don't want you to do that until I'm certain I'm going to sign.

They then vaguely recant and promptly get approval for the 10K bonus.

### Situation 2:

I ask for a 20% increase in stock package. The hiring manager, knowing that I'm negotiating with other companies, then fires back:

> I want to get this stock package for you. And I know I can, we've got the budget. But before I do that, I need your word on something.

> What's that?

> I need you to give me your word that if I improve your offer, you're not going to just turn around and take our counter-offer to [COMPETITOR_COMPANY] to improve your offer with them.

You should be thinking: so basically they're asking me not to negotiate. Cute.

> Let me see if I understand what you're saying. You are willing to improve my offer, but only if I agree that I won't tell [COMPETITOR] what you're offering me. Is that correct?

> Well no, I can't legally do that. What I mean is&hellip;what I mean is, look. I like you. But if I improve your offer and you just take our offer to [COMPETITOR], you'll be violating my trust.

> Okay, let me be sure I understand you here. If you give me this offer and I tell [COMPETITOR], I will be violating the trust under which you're granting me this improved offer. Is that correct?

> Uhh&hellip;Look. How about this. In my mind, I'm going to go get you this stock package okay? And in my head, I'm going to do it with the assumption that you're the kind of person I think you are, and you're going to consider our offer in its own right and not just shop it around. Fair enough?

I nod. He gets the improved offer. I continue to negotiate. Antics averted.

(In case you're wondering, if he had said &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; I would have turned down the proposal.)

## The Path to Signing

It's not enough to just continually ask for stuff. Companies need to sense that you're actually moving toward a final decision, and not just playing games with them.

Your goal in a negotiation is not to be difficult or elusive. True, you should assert your value and carefully consider your options, but you can do so in a way that's respectful and considerate toward the companies you're talking to.

Don't go dark on people. Be open and communicative. I keep saying be honest and I mean it&mdash;be honest.

Aside: I keep talking about honesty, and you might protest that this is antithetical to my earlier rule of &ldquo;protect information.&rdquo; It's not. True, you should protect information that might weaken your negotiating position, but you should be as communicative as possible about everything else (which is most things).

Negotiating is all about relationship, and communication is the bedrock of any relationship.

This brings me to the **the final rule: be winnable.** This is more than just giving the company the impression that you like them (which you continually should). But more so that you must give any company you're talking to a clear path on how to win you. Don't bullshit them or play stupid games. Be clear and unequivocal with your preferences and timeline.

If there is nothing that a company could do to sign you, or you don't actually want to work for them, then don't negotiate with them. Period.

Don't waste their time or play games for your own purposes. Even if the company isn't your dream company, you must be able to imagine at least some package they could offer you that would make you sign. If not, politely turn them down.

It costs each company money to interview you and to negotiate with you. I didn't negotiate with every company I received an offer from, but if there was one key mistake I made in my job search, it was that I still negotiated with too many (in large part because I didn't think my job search would be successful).

## Making the Final Decision

Okay, it's decision time.

(Yes, you do have to make one.)

Three things to keep in mind here:

1. Be clear about your deadline.
2. Assert your deadline continually.
3. Use your final decision as your trump card.

When you start negotiating you don't have to be clear about your timeline because you probably don't have one yet. But once you get into intermediary stages, you should set for yourself a deadline on which you'll sign. It can be for an arbitrary reason (or no reason at all), but just pre-committing to a deadline will allow you to negotiate more clearly and powerfully.

&ldquo;A weekend with the family.&rdquo; I found works nicely, as it has the added benefit of roping other decision makers in. Then when companies push you to end negotiations early, you can re-assert this deadline.

Companies should all be totally aware of when you're going to make your decision. This will raise the stakes and galvanize negotiations as the deadline approaches.

This deadline also lets you defer your decision while still improving offers. Your narrative should basically be &ldquo;I want to see the strongest offer your company can muster. Then I will go into my cave, meditate for 10 days, and when I emerge I will have decided in my heart which company to join.&rdquo; This gives you enormous power to avoid any on-the-spot decision points or premature promises.

Eventually, deadline day will come. Try to make this a business day (say, a Friday or a Monday) so that you can communicate with recruiters during this day. If a hail mary is going to happen, it'll happen here.

Even if there's only one company in the running, you should always *always* wait until the last day to sign your offer. Yes, even if you're certain you're going to sign and even if it's your dream job. I've seen many scenarios in which offers spontaneously improved as deadlines approached, or a fallen player gets up and presents you the holy grail in the 11th hour. Either way, there's no harm.

Finally, your trump card. Save this for the very end. Your trump card is these words: &ldquo;If you can do X, I will sign.&rdquo; Note, this is NOT &ldquo;If you give me X, the offer will be more compelling blah blah blah.&rdquo; Fuck that. It's time to make a promise.

Every company that's still on the table, let them know what it would take to sign you (unless there's nothing they could do). And when you make the final ask, don't forget reason-giving, even if it's the same reason as before!

> Hi Joel, I've been thinking it over and it's genuinely a really tough decision for me. I loved everyone at [COMPANY] but the one thing that makes it hard for me is the salary. As you know I'm trying to pay off my student loans so salary is really important to me right now. If you can improve the salary by 10K a year, then I'll be totally ready to sign.

With luck, they meet you half-way. Or, with a little more luck, they'll meet you all the way.

And just because I know someone will ask&mdash;yes, once say you're going to sign, you should always sign. Never go back on your word. It's a small world, people talk, and these kind of things will come back to haunt you. (More importantly, never go back on your word because you're the kind of person who never goes back on their word.)

Tell all of the other parties that you've made your final decision. Thank them for the negotiation. If you did it well, they'll usually thank you back, tell you to keep in touch, and to reach out again in a couple years next time you're on the market.

And that's it. You did it! Congratulations! You're still alive, right?

&hellip;You're not moving.

Well, that's fine. It's time toÂ celebrate your new job, you beautiful fool! (Drinks are on you.)

If you got some value out of this article, share it with a friend who'd benefit from it. Or better yet, [follow me on Twitter and I can be your friend](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?original_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fhaseebq.com%2F%3Fp%3D2393%26preview%3Dtrue&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&region=follow_link&screen_name=hosseeb&tw_p=followbutton).

There's a lot more in the works.

Until next time,]

title: 10 Principles I Want to Live By

---

I just came home from a vow of silence at a meditation center in northern California. It's a strange feeling coming back to city life after five days of silent meditation.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*W3bSf7ni68rbzw8Wy_tJTg.jpeg)

Looking around at puffing joggers, Christmas wreaths, eager couples waiting outside restaurants, the stop and start of traffic&mdash;it's almost too much for my senses.

The last time I took a vow of silence was 5 years ago. It lasted ten days. I had just walked away from my career as a poker player then. I was lost, confused. I was angry at myself. Entering the veil of silence, I expected to come out the other side with answers.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LXZVHL32G3g">[video]</div>

It was probably the hardest ten days of my life. But when I got to the other side, I emerged with only more questions.

This time feels different. Despite the dark of the winter solstice, I return from my vow of silence with unexpected clarity.

I decided that after I got home, I would write a letter to myself. This is that letter.

These last two years have been a cyclone of change. I've [pledged myself to earning-to-give](https://haseebq.com/why-ive-decided-to-devote-my-career-to-earning-to-give/), I've picked up my life and migrated to San Francisco, I've [shouldered my way into the tech industry](https://haseebq.com/farewell-app-academy-hello-airbnb-part-i/). Now I am a full-time software engineer.

I've been moving so fast, so much has obviously shifted. Yet internally, I still have this old image of myself. I've forgotten to even ask myself&mdash;what do I value now? How has it changed?

I wanted to create a document that I can look back on, to remind myself of my principles. If times are ever tough or I'm feeling stranded, that this letter can be a lodestone to guide me.

Call it a personal manifesto.

Usually when I write blog posts, I write them for other people. This post will be an exception&mdash;I am writing this first and foremost for myself. Nevertheless, I hope that this posts inspires your reflection, and that you might consider how these principles might be useful to you too.

## 1. LiveÂ simply.

You already have everything you need.

Simplify. Give things away. Turn down offers for more. Know that you are complete and you don't need more things to live a good life.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*SxUjpFIsHW7t7Iv2k3Nqqw.jpeg)

What a pleasure it is to pack up your life into a few bags and embark on a new life! Allow yourself to do that, again, and again, and again.

Of course, there's no shame in having things. But whatever you have, consider it all borrowed&mdash;and when it must be returned, do it with joy.

## 2. You will always haveÂ haters. Ignore them.

If you are passionate, if you are strange, if you defy what most people assume are the rules, you will court haters.

That's fine. Let them hate if that's what they need. Their hate will make you more resilient.

But most of all, you should be thankful that they showed up. Because if they didn't, it would be a sure sign what you were doing was not important.

> You have enemies? Good. That means you've stood up for something, sometime in yourÂ life. <div class="source">Winston Churchill</div>

## 3. Fight quietly for the things thatÂ matter.

Whether it be the people you love, or the causes that matter to you&mdash;do good work. Be humble. Fight hard, and fight with everything you've got.

Attention or fame can be pleasurable, sometimes even useful. But more often than not, it's a distraction from the real work.

## 4. Give yourselfÂ up.

It's not about you. It's about something bigger than you.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2ZlJC9xDCKWjUDj8ufheqA.jpeg)

Give. Contribute. Not just money, or time, but your identity. Make your life about more than just you.

> Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and preciousÂ life? <div class="source">Mary Oliver, &ldquo;The SummerÂ Day&rdquo;</div>

## 5. SeekÂ mastery.

Get better.

Work harder.

Practice, study, fumble.

Do this all your life.

Call it passion.

## 6. Be forever aÂ student.

There will always be people who are better, stronger, wiser than you.

When you don't know something, proclaim it out loud. Feverishly seek the answers. Wear out your knees with humbleness. Never let ignorance or shame deter you, because the desire to learn is always noble.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qBuMPCuhUBhdTr2HAmv34g.jpeg)

Go searching for your teachers, and don't give up until you find them.

## 7. Cultivate virtue&mdash;by force, if you haveÂ to.

You are a coward. You are fearful, you are lazy, you are selfish. Only once you know this can you begin the work of cultivating virtue.

You are principally what you do. So pledge. Show up. Keep coming back. And when you are too afraid to stay, sometimes you must lock yourself in the room and throw away the key.

## 8. You will find your ownÂ way.

Your life, your path, your failures and successes will not look like other people's. Though you will read many books and hear many stories, for better or for worse, their blueprints will not apply to you.

That's fine. You'll do great things, and in your own way. You will forge a path that no one will expect&mdash;not even you.

That's okay. Trust that your path, strange though it will seem, is right for you.

## 9. Build your wings on the wayÂ down.

Be smart, be calculated, be careful. But when opportunity arises, steel your nerves and take the leap. If you don't see any risks worth taking, you're not paying attention.

It's okay if you don't know what you're doing&mdash;trust that you'll learn before you hit the floor. And if you crash: brush yourself off, forgive your errors, and try again. This is the only way progress has ever happened.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5a5ovIzCTvdRlNeWns4iuA.jpeg)

## 10. Stay hungry, stayÂ foolish.

You are a little bit crazy. The world needs people like you&mdash;reckless, steaming, hapless dreamers.

So don't give it up. Keep asking for too much. Hunger for the world and everything in it, and don't slow down, no matter what people say.

> Forget safety. Live where you fear toÂ live.

> Destroy your reputation. Be notorious.

title: 2016 donations and some thoughts on the \"MuslimÂ Ban\"
tags: [effective altruism, personal]

---

I was originally planning to write this post reflecting on 2016 and my year-end donations (I know, better late than never). But given the political climate in the U.S. right now, I'm feeling pretty shaken. I don't usually write about politics, but I decided I needed to share a few thoughts.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c9stBEAGF4I">[video]</div>

First, donations.

[Note: for those who don't know my background; I am an effective altruist, and I earn-to-give. This means I entered into the tech industry so I could donate 33% of my pre-tax income to high-impact charities every year. I also blog openly about it.]

I first started earning-to-give when I landed my first job in the tech industry in June 2015. [In 2015 I donated a total of **$21,200**](https://haseebq.com/my-first-year-earning-to-give-a-retrospective/).

In 2016, my donations totaled **$50,600**. My finances this year were little more complicated, but that was my best estimate of 33% of my pre-tax income. (That income does not include RSUs; whenever I can liquidate them, I will also donate 33% of their value.)

Below are the organizations I donated to and why.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LqhZqp3zTN9D6CJsnoSPSQ.png)

## The Against Malaria Foundation

*Donation: $12,650 (25%)*

[The Against Malaria Foundation](https://www.againstmalaria.com/) distributes low-cost anti-mosquito bednets in parts of Africa that are ravaged by malaria. AMF has been repeatedly ranked by Givewell as the dollar-for-dollar most impactful charity in the world.

It's important to make speculative and high-risk altruistic investments. But there is some straightforward value in just rewarding and spreading the word about organizations that rock at saving lives (and in the worst case, to have no doubt that one's donations are having real positive impact). I also donated to them in 2015, and good chance I'll donate again in 2017.

![](http://cvox.imgix.net/images/campaign_11046/583756b782eb1_55d0e028cfa8836684be9b40a670736b.png?ixjsv=2.2.3&w=310)

## .impact

*Donation: $12,650 (25%)*

[.impact](http://dotimpact.im/) is a grassroots EA organization that maintains a lot of Effective Altruism's infrastructure, including the [EA Forum](http://effective-altruism.com/) (which I highly recommend). One of their most exciting projects is LEAN (Local Effective Altruism Network), which helps to seed and support university EA organizations. I also donated to them in 2015.

Young people have already shown that in many ways they are going to be the primary vector for change in this world. And as those young people come into power, I'd love to see more of them thinking rigorously about how to do good.Â 

In short, I think influencing more young people to think critically about effectiveness is one of our best levers for ensuring a positive future.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_IkNmLi8VpyThIYZCUNdMA.png)

## 80,000 Hours

*Donation: $25,300 (50%)*

My largest donation this year was to [80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/) (80K). 80K is an organization that advises young people on how to do the most good with their careers. They analyze different career paths, balancing career capital with altruistic aims.

80K actually strongly affected my own trajectory when I was considering career pursuits. Reading through their career guide on tech entrepreneurship influenced my original decision to enter into the tech industry.

[80K has had had impressive growth and has done a lot of good for influencing more students on the path to altruistic lives](https://80000hours.org/2016/12/annual-review-dec-2016/). There's a big talent gap in effective altruism right now, and 80K seems like the best investment for filling that gap. I'm excited to see what they can do in 2017.

So that wraps up my donations. Now I'd like to do what I normally never do, and say a few words about the political climate in the U.S.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LeEPFvCBl6u638r_dsvViA.png)

## Authoritarianism, walls, and the &ldquo;MuslimÂ Ban&rdquo;

Far more capable minds than mine have spilled enough ink on this topic, so I'm going to keep my words brief.

Things are moving faster than anyone expected. But history has seen this before. **Our environment is likely to change fast, and unpredictably.**

Keep your eyes open. Be vigilant. Know your power and use it wisely, and where you have none, stay safe.

It's a scary and saddening time. History books will struggle to make sense of this. And when we are old, we will look back and talk with shame about the barbarism that America, for a time, succumbed to.

But I am optimistic. When I see the protests happening across the U.S. and around the world, the international condemnation of these regressive and protectionist policies, when I see the power and fury of a culture founded on inclusion and love&mdash;it gives me confidence.

The world is changing. Though we may have stumbled, we are going to take two steps forward.

I, for one, am going to keep fighting in my own way.Â 

I hope you do the same.

title: The Time I Had to Crack My Own RedditÂ Password
tags: [personal, programming]
image: hackers.jpg
---

**I have no self-control.**

Luckily, I know this about myself. This allows me to consciously engineer my life so that despite having the emotional maturity of a heroin-addicted lab rat, I'm occasionally able to get things done.

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/gOH54eiriYIwM/giphy.gif">
<div class="caption">Mm, a waste of time!</div>

I waste a lot of time on Reddit. If I want to procrastinate on something, I'll often open a new tab and dive down a Reddit-hole. But sometimes one needs to turn on the blinders and dial down distractions. 2015 was one of these times&mdash;I was singularly focused on improving as a programmer, and Redditing was becoming a liability.

I needed an abstinence plan.

So it occurred to me: how about I lock myself out of my account?Â 

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zI-riJZiY7s">[video]</div>

## Here's what I did:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*8Zpw3ipnu92ehqA_6T-o8w.gif)

I set a random password on my account. Then I asked a friend to e-mail me this password on a certain date. With that, I'd have a foolproof way to lock myself out of Reddit. (Also changed the e-mail for password recovery to cover all the bases.)

This should have worked.

Unfortunately it turns out, friends are very susceptible to social engineering. The technical terminology for this is that they are &ldquo;nice to you&rdquo; and will give you back your password if you &ldquo;beg them.&rdquo;

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/uB6rsQFg5yPzW/giphy.gif)

After a few rounds of this failure mode, I needed a more robust solution. A little Google searching, and I came across this:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*iMtDCzvNYVF9UOeiIbU7Ww.png)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*7QCLp-4HnnDwgj1FSnRstw.png)
<div class="caption">(Looks legit.)</div>

Perfect&mdash;an automated, friend-less solution! (I'd alienated most of them by now, so that was a big selling point.)

A bit sketchy looking, but hey, any port in a storm.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TOUIDOIRHiVySUWt46n3mw.gif)

For a while I set this up this routine&mdash;during the week I'd e-mail myself my password, on the weekends I'd receive the password, load up on internet junk food, and then lock myself out again once the week began. It worked quite well from what I remember.

Eventually I got so busy with programming stuff, I completely forgot about it.

## Cut to two yearsÂ later.

I'm now gainfully employed at Airbnb. And Airbnb, it so happens, has a large test suite. This means waiting, and waiting of course means internet rabbit holes.

I decide to scrounge up my old account and find my Reddit password.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sAr_MYJtJVkNq6uHiVQxtQ.gif)

Oh. *Oh. Oh shit.*

I didn't remember doing this, but I must have gotten so fed up with myself that **I locked myself out until 2018**. I also set it to &ldquo;hide,&rdquo; so I couldn't view the contents of the e-mail until it's sent.

What do I do? Do I just have to create a new Reddit account and start from scratch? But that's *so much work.*

I could write in to LetterMeLater and explain that I didn't mean to do this. But they would probably take a while to get back to me. We've already established I'm wildly impatient. Plus this site doesn't look like it has a support team. Not to mention it would be an embarrassing e-mail exchange. I started brainstorming elaborate explanations involving dead relatives about why I needed access to the e-mailâ€¦

All of my options were messy. I was walking home that night from the office pondering my predicament, when suddenly it hit me.

**The search bar.**

I pulled up the app on my mobile phone and tried it:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DvLUtm_ZGOaTGKy1bOuyYQ.gif)

Hmm.

Okay. So it's indexing the subject for sure. What about the body?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*esw6gkV0G-M1JKaPAqipLA.gif)

I try a few letters, and voila. It's definitely got the body indexed. Remember: the body consisted entirely of my password.

*Essentially, I've been given an interface to perform substring queries.* By entering in a string into the search bar, the search results will confirm whether my password contains this substring.

**We're in business.**

I hurry into my apartment, drop my bag, and pull out my laptop.

Algorithms problem: you are given a function `substring?(str)`, which returns true or false depending on whether a password contains any given substring. *Given this function, write an algorithm that can deduce the hidden password.*

## The Algorithm

So let's think about this. A few things I know about my password: I know it was a long string with some random characters, probably something along the lines of `asgoihej2409g`. I *probably* didn't include any upper-case characters (and Reddit doesn't enforce that as a password constraint) so let's assume for now that I didn't&mdash;in case I did, we can just expand the search space later if the initial algorithm fails.

We also have a subject line as part of the string we're querying. And we know the subject is &ldquo;password&rdquo;.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XvaVCyWtSdqKSz59HKnNDw.png)

Let's pretend the body is 6 characters long. So we've got six slots of characters, some of which may appear in the subject line, some of which certainly don't. So if we take all of the characters that aren't in the subject and try searching for each of them, we know for sure we'll hit a unique letter that's in the password. Think like a game of Wheel of Fortune.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LOzh--_Ujutrh_OKhjfNaw.png)

We keep trying letters one by one until we hit a match for something that's not in our subject line. Say we hit it.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fdoVAq3t5naQ5G9yARr0RA.png)

Once I've found my first letter, I don't actually know where in this string I am. But I know I can start building out a bigger substring by appending different characters to the end of this until I hit another substring match.

We'll potentially have to iterate through every character in our alphabet to find it. Any of those characters could be correct, so on average it'll hit somewhere around the middle, so given an alphabet of size `A`, it should average out to `A/2` guesses per letter (let's assume the subject is small and there are no repeating patterns of 2+ characters).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GJ5xKZzTe0F5un-Iz11pXg.png)

I'll keep building this substring until it eventually hits the end and no characters can extend it further.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*E9ri3Rf8LBPxUTjgs5BvPQ.png)

But that's not enough&mdash;most likely, there will be a prefix to the string that I missed, because I started in a random place. Easy enough: all I have to do is now repeat the process, except going backwards.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*F_n0WGRP_8RJdFtR-v0b1g.png)

Once the process terminates, I should be able to reconstruct the password. In total, I'll need to figure out `L` characters (where `L` is the length), and need to expend on average `A/2` guesses per character (where `A` is the alphabet size), so total guesses = `A/2 \* L`.

To be precise, I also have to add another `2A` to the number of guesses for ascertaining that the string has terminated on each end. So the total is `A/2 \* L + 2A`, which we can factor as `A(L/2 + 2)`.

Let's assume we have 20 characters in our password, and an alphabet consisting of `a-z` (26) and `0â€“9` (10), so a total alphabet size of 36. So we're looking at an average of `36 \* (20/2 + 2) = 36 \* 12 = 432` iterations.

Damn.

This is actually doable.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/119cVU19ICcAKc/giphy.gif)

## The Implementation

First things first: I need to write a client that can programmatically query the search box. This will serve as my substring oracle. Obviously this site has no API, so I'll need to scrape the website directly.

Looks like the URL format for searching is just a simple query string, `www.lettermelater.com/account.php?**qe=#{query_here}**`. That's easy enough.

Let's start writing this script. I'm going to use the Faraday gem for making web requests, since it has a simple interface that I know well.

I'll start by making an API class.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/b34b7e50009ca20511abaf9e4c7e2aab.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/b34b7e50009ca20511abaf9e4c7e2aab).</noscript>

Of course, we don't expect this to work yet, as our script won't be authenticated into any account. As we can see, the response returns a 302 redirect with an error message provided in the cookie.

```
[10] pry(main)> Api.get("foo")
=> #<:response:0x007fc01a5716d8>
...
{"date"=>"Tue, 04 Apr 2017 15:35:07 GMT",
"server"=>"Apache",
"x-powered-by"=>"PHP/5.2.17",
"set-cookie"=>"msg_error=You+must+be+signed+in+to+see+this+page.",
"location"=>".?pg=account.php",
"content-length"=>"0",
"connection"=>"close",
"content-type"=>"text/html; charset=utf-8"},
status=302></:response:0x007fc01a5716d8>
```

So how do we sign in? We need to send in our [cookies](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17769011/how-does-cookie-based-authentication-work) in the header, of course. Using Chrome inspector we can trivially grab them.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*PSxZtW4wppyzRXMdBWgGWw.gif)

(Not going to show my real cookie here, obviously. Interestingly, looks like it's storing `user_id` client-side which is always a great sign.)

Through process of elimination, I realize that it needs both `code` and `user_id` to authenticate me&hellip;sigh.

So I add these to the script. (This is a fake cookie, just for illustration.)

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/8eaaf329895f3dc64a069b7f2c0a0197.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/8eaaf329895f3dc64a069b7f2c0a0197).</noscript>

```
[29] pry(main)> Api.get("foo")
=> "\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN\"\"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd\">\n<html>\n<head>\n\t<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />\n\t<meta name=\"Description\" content=\"LetterMeLater.com allows you to send emails to anyone, with the ability to have them sent at any future date and time you choose.\" />\n\t<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"schedule email, recurring, repeating, delayed, text messaging, delivery, later, future, reminder, date, time, capsule\" />\n\t<title>LetterMeLater.com â€” Account Information</title>â€¦
[30] pry(main)> _.include?("Haseeb")
=> true
```

It's got my name in there, so we're definitely logged in!

We've got the scraping down, now we just have to parse the result. Luckily, this pretty easy&mdash;we know it's a hit if the e-mail result shows up on the page, so we just need to look for any string that's unique when the result is present. The string &ldquo;password&rdquo; appears nowhere else, so that will do just nicely.=op

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*cZT37Ji9j8sm8dobFpiAWQ.png)

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/4db364c7432730e4f432c3ea3dcac9bc.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/4db364c7432730e4f432c3ea3dcac9bc).</noscript>

That's all we need for our API class. We can now do substring queries entirely in Ruby.

```
[31] pry(main)> Api.include?('password')
=> true
[32] pry(main)> Api.include?('f')
=> false
[33] pry(main)> Api.include?('g')
=> true
```

Now that we know that works, let's stub out the API while we develop our algorithm. Making HTTP requests is going to be really slow and we might trigger some rate-limiting as we're experimenting. If we assume our API is correct, once we get the rest of the algorithm working, everything should just work once we swap the real API back in.

So here's the stubbed API, with a random secret string:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/07630885b15348da15c92835860d5415.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/07630885b15348da15c92835860d5415).</noscript>

We'll inject the stubbed API into the class while we're testing. Then for the final run, we'll use the real API to query for the real password.

So let's get started with this class. From a high level, recalling my algorithm diagram, it goes in three steps:

1. First, find the first letter that's not in the subject but exists in the password. This is our starting off point.
2. Build those letters forward until we fall off the end of the string.
3. Build that substring backwards until we hit the beginning of the string.

Then we're done!

Let's start with initialization. We'll inject the API, and other than that we just need to initialize the current password chunk to be an empty string.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/4cb8aa0c850c6584a584dc76f975dc2f.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/4cb8aa0c850c6584a584dc76f975dc2f).</noscript>

Now let's write three methods, following the steps we outlined.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/ba8b2e06bf9727afe3d10696c786d663.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/ba8b2e06bf9727afe3d10696c786d663).</noscript>

Perfect. Now the rest of the implementation can take place in private methods.

For finding the first letter, we need to iterate over each character in the alphabet that's not contained in the subject. To construct this alphabet, we're going to use `a-z` and `0â€“9`. Ruby allows us to do this pretty easily with ranges:

```
ALPHABET = (('a'..'z').to_a + ('0'..'9').to_a).shuffle
```

I prefer to shuffle this to remove any bias in the password's letter distribution. This will make our algorithm query `A/2` times on average per character, even if the password is non-randomly distributed.

We also want to set the subject as a constant:

```
SUBJECT = 'password'
```

That's all the setup we need. Now time to write `find_starting_letter`. This needs to iterate through each candidate letter (in the alphabet but not in the subject) until it finds a match.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/32224d08a3c1350dc849521618b0b0ac.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/32224d08a3c1350dc849521618b0b0ac).</noscript>

In testing, looks like this works perfectly:

```
PasswordCracker.new(ApiStub).send(:find_starting_letter!) # => 'f'
```

Now for the heavy lifting.

I'm going to do this recursively, because it makes the structure very elegant.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/3d6ea350690f47790fe8f13b729a00e1.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/3d6ea350690f47790fe8f13b729a00e1).</noscript>

The code is surprisingly straightforward. Let's see if it works with our stub API.

```
[63] pry(main)> PasswordCracker.new(ApiStub).crack!
f
fj
fjp
fjpe
fjpef
fjpefo
fjpefoj
fjpefoj4
fjpefoj49
fjpefoj490
fjpefoj490r
fjpefoj490rj
fjpefoj490rjg
fjpefoj490rjgs
fjpefoj490rjgsd
=> "fjpefoj490rjgsd"
```

Awesome. We've got a suffix, now just to build backward and complete the string. This should look very similar.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/e8fb85d9a9681906e4a0511b1ebfc137.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/e8fb85d9a9681906e4a0511b1ebfc137).</noscript>

In fact, there's only two lines of difference here: how we construct the `guess`, and the name of the recursive call. There's an obvious refactoring here, so let's do it.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/a6f3a62bb3ae96442d6fe13288e3739b.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/a6f3a62bb3ae96442d6fe13288e3739b).</noscript>

Now these other calls simply reduce to:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/192d898aaaff1fed314008f232aaa3cb.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/192d898aaaff1fed314008f232aaa3cb).</noscript>

And let's see how it works in action:

```

And now&hellip;the magic moment. Let's swap the stub with the real API and see what happens.

### The Moment ofÂ Truth

Cross your fingers&hellip;

```
PasswordCracker.new(Api).crack!
```

<div class="caption">(Sped upÂ 3x)</div>

Boom. 443 iterations.

Tried it out on Reddit, and login was successful.

Wow.

It&hellip;actually worked.

Recall our original formula for the number of iterations: `A(N/2 + 2)`. The true password was 22 characters, so our formula would estimate `36 \* (22/2 + 2) = 36 \* 13 = 468` iterations. Our real password took 443 iterations, so our estimate was within 5% of the observed runtime.

**Math.**

**It works.**

Embarrassing support e-mail averted. Reddit rabbit-holing restored. It's now confirmed: programming is, indeed, magic.

(The downside is I am now going to have to find a new technique to lock myself out of my accounts.)

And with that, I'm gonna get back to my internet rabbit-holes. Thanks for reading, and share this if you enjoyed it!

title: Blockchain: the revolution we're not ready for

---

Imagine you didn't need to trust a stranger to make a deal with them. Imagine you didn't need to trust your bank to deposit your money there. Imagine you didn't need to trust your government to know it was being just and fair.

What would happen?

**It would change the world.**

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k3Zb_4ZOM7M"></div>

This is precisely the promise of blockchains.

Cryptocurrencies, which are built on blockchains, are all over the press these days, mostly because of the high prices, volatility, and sensational narratives surrounding debacles like [Mt. Gox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox) and [The Silk Road](https://www.wired.com/2015/04/silk-road-1/).

But there's something much bigger going on than just digital currencies.

While the mainstream media has been busy speculating about prices and black market intrigues, they've missed the fact that beneath it all, cryptographers had quietly invented an entirely new set of technological primitives.

Blockchains (and the consensus protocols that support them) were invented as a result of cyberpunks trying to solve a bold problem: how to create digital, untraceable money. By combining cryptography, game theory, economics, and computer science, they managed to create an entirely new set of tools for building decentralized systems.

But what they created will change much more than just how we exchange money. It's going to change the entire world. And hardly anyone seems to notice.

Edward Witten, the famous physicist, once said of string theory that it was <q>a part of 21st century physics that fell by chance into the 20th century.</q> In other words, the physics community was not ready for string theory.

**Blockchain is a 22nd century technology that fell by chance into the early 21st century.**

It's painfully obvious that we're not ready for it.

## What is a blockchain?

At its core, a blockchain is a surprisingly simple and elegant data structure. It's basically just a linked list with one important augmentationâ€”each block contains a [cryptographic hash](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) of the previous block. This creates an effectively unalterable chain of blocks and their fingerprints, stretching back to the original block.

![Blockchain](http://i.imgur.com/Ymhi8jq.png)

If everyone in your system replicates this linked list (and verifies its legitimacy by repeating the cryptographic hash functions), it will implement a slow and somewhat crude distributed database that's resistant to tampering.

And that's a blockchain. Doesn't sound that amazing, does it?

Of course, to actually build a functional protocol, you need a lot more than thatâ€”you'll need authentication (public/private key cryptography), a consensus mechanism (Nakamoto consensus via proof-of-work or various kinds of proof-of-stake), space and time optimizations (Merkle trees and Merkle proofs), and a bunch of fancy peer-to-peer networking stuff. But that's a subject for another, more technical blog post.

The point is this: **blockchains are a genuinely new tool for organizing complex systems**. And we are only beginning to understand how to integrate them into the real world.

## The promise of blockchains
If everyone works off the same blockchain, and everyone openly shares what the current state of the blockchain is, and it's computationally intractable to tamper with it, and everyone agrees on rules of how new data is committed&hellip; then suddenly everything changes.

Suddenly you can build completely decentralized systems that require no trust among participants. So long as enough actors in the system follow the rules of the protocol (in the most primitive case, at least 50% of them are good), then you can imbue the system with provable security guarantees. Conspiracies or bad actors can't censor or vandalize the system.

You can even engineer the right incentives straight into the protocol, and then have every actor in the system enforce them.

Using blockchains, a lot of massive coordination problems simply disappear. Conundrums that plague global financial infrastructure, voting, international remittances, insurance policies, custodial records, and even government corruption can simply be designed out of existence.

By creating the right system with the right guarantees, you can fix bad incentives. You can eliminate corrupt middle-men and rent-seekers. You can create whole new societies that can coordinate better, more transparently, and more efficiently than ever before considered possible.

**It's really hard for most people to grasp the significance of this.**

I'll put it this way: if John Locke knew about blockchains, it undoubtedly would've compelled him to write a third treatise on government. It would've been a revolutionary idea in how to coordinate a society.

## The future of the future
Most people I know right now in Silicon Valley are focused on deep learning and AI as the most promising technological revolution. And I share their enthusiasm! Deep learning is going to upend industries and give us new capabilities that we only imagined in high science fiction.

But blockchainâ€”blockchain is going to upend entire societies. It's going to enable new kinds of governance systems that were before only the daydreams of utopians and philosophers.

And yet, when you look at the cryptocurrency world right now, you're not necessarily going to recognize that.

Most of what's going on right now falls into two categories.

The first are the crypto-anarchists and hackers who are building low-level protocols. They're racing to build what will become the decentralized TCP/IP stack for future builders.

The second category are the profiteers who trying to make a quick buck off the unaware and the optimistic.

Unfortunately, this second category is getting most of the attention.

## The tower of Blockchain
![tower of Babel](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Pieter_Bruegel_the_Elder_-_The_Tower_of_Babel_%28Vienna%29_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/1200px-Pieter_Bruegel_the_Elder_-_The_Tower_of_Babel_%28Vienna%29_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg)
Imagine stumbling across the world wide web in 1995, browsing through dinky fan sites catering to eccentrics, and thinking: "Hah. Wow. This weird little ecosystem is going to be really important someday."

That was blockchain a few years ago. In other words, blockchain has safely crossed the Angelfire chasm.

Now that it has proven its first glimmer of usefulness, the next act is inevitable.

You may have heard about the [ICO mania](https://medium.com/blockchannel/understanding-the-ethereum-ico-token-hype-429481278f45), or the recent rallies of [the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/). The wise and the wily have taken notice and have realized blockchain's tremendous potential. And they've already made and lost fortunes speculating on the potential future of cryptocurrencies.

![Crypto prices](http://i.imgur.com/OlfsjU9.png)

It's unfortunate that right now, blockchain-as-speculation is dominating most people's attention. The signal is getting drowned in the noise.

But that's to be expected. We've seen this before.

When people first realized the extraordinary potential of the internet, tons of money was pumped into random dot coms. Anticipating mass adoption and astronomical value creation, speculation fed speculation, [until the frenzy finally crashed in 2001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble).

What's going on right now is comparable. There will eventually be a comedown.

But when the dust is cleared, like after the dot com crash, those who were seriousâ€”the Microsofts, the Amazons, the Googlesâ€”will have to come in and do the graceless work of building the future.

There's much work to do.

I recently left my job at Airbnb. I was working on payments fraud for a little over a year. It was fascinating and impactful workâ€”Airbnb is an awesome companyâ€”and I left on good terms. But the more I've been learning about crypto and blockchains, the more I'm convinced that this stuff is going to change the world.

And that's why I'm going to be working on the blockchain. (And probably keep blogging about it!)

For now, thanks for reading.

title: A hacker stole $31M of Etherâ€”how it happened and what it means for Ethereum
tags: [blockchain, programming]
image: /content/images/2017/07/blockchain.png
---

Yesterday, a hacker pulled off the second biggest heist in the history of digital currencies.

Around 12:00 PST, an unknown attacker exploited a critical flaw in the Parity multi-signature wallet on the Ethereum network, draining three massive wallets of over $31,000,000 worth of Ether in a matter of minutes. Given a couple more hours, the hacker could've made off with over $180,000,000 from vulnerable wallets.

But someone stopped them.

![Hacker](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*l0L_X-wFPpb3YHJ0Oqxp_Q.png)

Having sounded the alarm bells, a group of benevolent white-hat hackers from the Ethereum community rapidly organized. They analyzed the attack and realized that there was no way to reverse the thefts, yet many more wallets were vulnerable. Time was of the essence, so they saw only one available option: **hack the remaining wallets before the attacker did.**

By exploiting the same vulnerability, the white-hats [hacked all of the remaining at-risk wallets](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1dba1131000664b884a1ba238464159892252d3a) and drained their accounts, effectively preventing the attacker from reaching any of the remaining $150,000,000.

*Yes, you read that right.*

To prevent the hacker from robbing any more banks, the white-hats wrote software to rob all of the remaining banks in the world. Once the money was safely stolen, they began the process of returning the funds to their respective account holders. The people who had their money saved by this heroic feat are now in the process of retrieving their funds.

It's an extraordinary story, and it has significant implications for the world of cryptocurrencies.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MNIOdEWdqvI">[video]</div>

**It's important to understand that this exploit was not a vulnerability in Ethereum or in Parity itself.** Rather, it was a vulnerability in the default smart contract code that the Parity client gives the user for deploying multi-signature wallets.

This is all pretty complicated, so to make the details of this clear for everyone, this post is broken into three parts:

1. **What exactly happened?** An explanation of Ethereum, smart contracts, and multi-signature wallets.
2. **How did they do it?** A technical explanation of the attack (specifically for programmers).
3. **What now?** The attack's implications about the future and security of smart contracts.

If you are familiar with Ethereum and the crypto world, you can skip to the second section.

## 1. What exactly happened?

There are three building blocks to this story: **Ethereum**, **smart contracts**, and **digital wallets**.

![Ethereum](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*J_yJEaeQXUZ_Wk2w5sQXuQ.png)

**[Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/)** is a digital currency invented in 2013â€”a full 4 years after the release of Bitcoin. It has since grown to be the second largest digital currency in the world by market capâ€”$20 billion to Bitcoin's $40 billion.

Like all cryptocurrencies, Ethereum is a descendant of the Bitcoin protocol and improves on Bitcoin's design. But don't be fooled: though it is a digital currency like Bitcoin, Ethereum is much more powerful.

While Bitcoin uses its blockchain to implement a ledger of monetary transactions, Ethereum uses its blockchain to record state transitions in a gigantic distributed computer. Ethereum's corresponding digital currency, `ether` is essentially a side effect of powering this massive computer.

To put it another way, *Ethereum is literally a computer that spans the entire world*. Anyone who runs the Ethereum software on their computer is participating in the operations of this world-computer, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Because the EVM was designed to be [Turing-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) (ignoring gas limits), it can do almost anything that can be expressed in a computer program.

Let me be emphatic: *this is crazy shit*. The crypto world is ebullient about the potential of Ethereum, which has seen its value skyrocket in the last 6 months.

![Ethereum price chart](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*cGo4ezL9EPH_jGqsj3QS_Q.png)

The developer community has rallied behind it, and there's a lot of excitement about what can be built on top of the EVMâ€”and this brings us to smart contracts.

**Smart contracts** are simply computer programs that run on the EVM. In many ways they are like normal contracts, except they don't need lawyers or judges to interpret them. Instead, they are compiled to bytecode and interpreted unambiguously by the EVM. With these programs, you can (among other things) programmatically transfer digital currency based solely on the rules of the contract code.

Of course, there are things normal contracts do that smart contracts can'tâ€”smart contracts can't easily interact with things that aren't on the blockchain. But smart contracts can also do things that normal contracts can't, such as enforce a set of rules entirely through unbreakable cryptography.

This leads us to the notion of **wallets**. In the world of digital currencies, wallets are how you store your assets. You gain access to your wallet using essentially a secret password, also known as your private key ([simplified a bit](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/asymmetric-cryptography)). There are many different types of wallets that confer different security properties, such as withdrawal limits. One of the most popular types is the multi-signature wallet.

In a multi-signature wallet, there are several private keys that can unlock the wallet, but just one key is not enough to unlock it. If your multi-signature wallet has 3 keys, for example, you can specify that at least 2 of the 3 keys must be provided to successfully unlock it. This means that if you, your father, and your mother are each signatories on this wallet, even if a criminal hacked your mother and stole her private key, they could still not access your funds. This leads to much stronger security guarantees, so multi-sigs are a standard in wallet security.

This is the type of wallet the hacker attacked.

So what went wrong? Did they break the private keys? Did they use a quantum computer, or some kind of cutting-edge factoring algorithm?

Nope, all the cryptography was sound. The exploit was almost laughably simple: they found a programmer-introduced bug in the code that let them re-initialize the wallet, almost like restoring it to factory settings. Once they did that, they were free to set themselves as the new owners, and then walk out with everything.

## 2. How did this happen?

What follows is a technical explanation of exactly what happened. If you're not a developer, you can skip to the next section, as this is going to be programming-heavy.

Ethereum has a fairly unique programming model. On Ethereum, you write code by publishing contracts (which you can think of as objects), and transactions are executed by calling methods on these objects to mutate their state.

In order to run code on Ethereum, you need to first deploy the contract (the deployment is itself a transaction), which costs a small amount of Ether. You then need to call methods on the contract to interact with it, which costs more Ether. As you can imagine, this incentivizes a programmer to optimize their code, both to minimize transactions and minimize computation costs.

One way to reduce costs is to use libraries. By making your contract call out to a shared library that was deployed at a previous time, you don't have to re-deploy any shared code. In Ethereum, keeping your code DRY will directly save you money.

The default multi-sig wallet in Parity did exactly this. It held a reference to a shared external library which contained wallet initialization logic. This shared library is referenced by the public key of the library contract.

```javascript
// FIELDS
address constant _walletLibrary = 0xa657491c1e7f16adb39b9b60e87bbb8d93988bc3;
```

The library is called in several places, via an EVM instruction called `DELEGATECALL`, which does the following: for whatever method that calls `DELEGATECALL`, it will call the same method on the contract you're delegating to, but using the context of the current contract. It's essentially like a `super` call, except without the inheritance part. (The equivalent in JavaScript would be `OtherClass.functionName.apply(this, args)`.)

Here's an example of this in their multi-sig wallet: the `isOwner` method just delegates to the shared wallet library's `isOwner` method, using the current contract's state.

```javascript
function isOwner(address _addr) constant returns (bool) {
  return _walletLibrary.delegatecall(msg.data);
}
```

This is innocent enough. The multi-sig wallet itself contained all of the right permission checks, and they were sure to rigorously enforce authorization on all sensitive actions related to the wallet's state.

But they made one critical mistake.

Solidity allows you to define a "fallback method". This is the method that gets called when there's no method that matches a given method name. You define it by not giving it a name:

```javascript
function() {
  // do stuff here for all unknown methods
}
```

The Parity team decided to let any unknown method that sent Ether to the contract just default to depositing the sent Ether.

```javascript
function() payable {
  // payable is just a keyword that means this method can receive/pay Ether

  if (msg.value > 0) {
    // just being sent some cash?
    Deposit(msg.sender, msg.value);
  }
  throw;
}
```

But they took it a step further, and herein was their critical mistake. Below is the *actual code that was attacked*.

```javascript
function() payable {
  // just being sent some cash?
  if (msg.value > 0)
    Deposit(msg.sender, msg.value);
  else if (msg.data.length > 0)
    _walletLibrary.delegatecall(msg.data);
}
```

Basically:

* If the method name is not defined on this contract...
* And there's no ether being sent in the transaction...
* And there is some data in the message payload...

Then it will call the exact same method if it's defined in `_walletLibrary`, but in the context of this contract.

Using this, the attacker called a method called `initWallet()`, which was not defined on the multisig contract *but was* defined in the shared wallet library:

```javascript
function initWallet(address[] _owners, uint _required, uint _daylimit) {
  initDaylimit(_daylimit);
  initMultiowned(_owners, _required);
}
```

Which calls the `initMultiowned` method...

```javascript
function initMultiowned(address[] _owners, uint _required) {
  m_numOwners = _owners.length + 1;
  m_owners[1] = uint(msg.sender);
  m_ownerIndex[uint(msg.sender)] = 1;
  for (uint i = 0; i < _owners.length; ++i)
  {
    m_owners[2 + i] = uint(_owners[i]);
    m_ownerIndex[uint(_owners[i])] = 2 + i;
  }
  m_required = _required;
}
```

Do you see what just happened there? The attacker essentially **reinitialized the contract** by delegating through the library method, overwriting the owners on the original contract. They and whatever array of owners they supply as arguments will be the new owners.

Given that they now control the entire wallet, they can trivially extract the remainder of the balance. And that's precisely what they did.

The initWallet: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x707aabc2f24d756480330b75fb4890ef6b8a26ce0554ec80e3d8ab105e63db07

The transfer:
https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9654a93939e98ce84f09038b9855b099da38863b3c2e0e04fd59a540de1cb1e5

So what was ultimately the vulnerability? You could argue there were two. First, the `initWallet` and `initMultiowned` in the wallet library were not marked as `internal` (this is like a `private` method, which would prevent this delegated call), and those methods did not check that the wallet wasn't already initialized. Either check would've made this hack impossible.

The second vulnerability was the raw `delegateCall`. You can think of this as equivalent to a raw `eval` statement, running on a user-supplied string. In an attempt to be succinct, this contract used metaprogramming to proxy potential method calls to an underlying library. The safer approach here would be to whitelist specific methods that the user is allowed to call.

The trouble, of course, is that this is more expensive in gas costs (since it has to evaluate more conditionals). But when it comes to security, we probably have to get over this concern when writing smart contracts that move massive amounts of money.

*So that was the attack.*

It was a clever catch, but once you point it out, it seems almost elementary. The attacker then jumped on this vulnerability for three of the largest wallets they could findâ€”but judging from the transaction times, they were doing this entirely manually. The white-hat group was doing this at scale using scripts, and that's why they were able to beat the attacker to the punch. Given this, it's unlikely that the attacker was very sophisticated in how they planned their attack.

You might ask the question thoughâ€”why don't they just roll back this hack, like they did with the [DAO hack](https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/the-dao-the-hack-the-soft-fork-and-the-hard-fork/)?

Unfortunately that's not really possible. The DAO hack was unique in that when the attacker drained the DAO into a child DAO, the funds were frozen for many days inside a smart contract before they could be released to the attacker.

This prevented any of the stolen funds from going into circulation, so the stolen Ether was effectively siloed. This gave the Ethereum community plenty of time to conduct a public quorum about how to deal with the attack.

In this attack, the attacker immediately stole the funds and could start spending them. A hard fork would be impracticalâ€“what do you do about all of the transactions that occur downstream? What about the people who innocently traded assets with the attacker? Once the ether they've stolen gets laundered and enters general circulation, it's like counterfeit bills circulating in the economyâ€”it's easy to stop when it's all in one briefcase, but once everyone's potentially holding a counterfeit bill, you can't really turn back the clock anymore.

So the transaction won't get reversed. The $31M loss stands. It's a costly, but necessary lesson.

So what should we take away from this?

## 3. What does this attack mean for Ethereum?

There are several important takeaways here.

**First, remember, this was not a flaw in Ethereum or in smart contracts in general. Rather, it was a developer error in a particular contract.**

So who were the crackpot developers who wrote this? They should've known better, right?

[The developers here](https://blog.parity.io/the-multi-sig-hack-a-postmortem/) were a cross-collaboration between the Ethereum foundation (literally the creators of Ethereum), the Parity core team, and members of the open-source community. It underwent extensive peer review. This is basically the highest standard of programming that exists in the Ethereum ecosystem.

These developers were human. They made a mistake. And so did the reviewers who audited this code.

I've read some comments on Reddit and HackerNews along the lines of: "What an obvious mistake! How was it even possible they missed this?" (Ignoring that the "obvious" vulnerability was introduced in January and only now discovered.)

When I see responses like this, I know the people commenting are not professional developers. For a serious developer, the reaction is instead: *damn, that was a dumb mistake. I'm glad I wasn't the one who made it.*

Mistakes of this sort are **routinely** made in programming. All programs carry the risk of developer error. We have to throw off the mindset of "if they were just more careful, this wouldn't have happened." At a certain scale, carefulness is not enough.

As programs scale to non-trivial complexity, you have to start taking it as a *given* that programs are probably not correct. No amount of human diligence or testing is sufficient to prevent all possible bugs. Even organizations like Google or NASA make programming mistakes, despite the extreme rigor they apply to their most critical code.

We would do well to take a page from site reliability practices at companies like Google and Airbnb. Whenever there's a production bug or outage, they do a postmortem analysis and distribute it within the company. In these postmortems, there is always a principle of *never blaming individuals*.

Blaming mistakes on individuals is pointless, because all programmers, no matter how experienced, have a nonzero likelihood of making a mistake. Instead, the purpose of a postmortem is to identify what in the process allowed that mistake to get deployed.

The problem was not that the developer forgot to add `internal` to the wallet library, or that they did a raw `delegateCall` without checking what method was being called.

**The problem is that their programming toolchain allowed them to make these mistakes.**

As the smart contract ecosystem evolves, it has to evolve in the direction of making these mistakes harder, and that means making contracts secure by default.

This leads me to my next point.

**Strength is a weakness** when it comes to programming languages. The stronger and more expressive a programming language is, the more complex its code becomes. Solidity is a very complex language, modeled to resemble Java.

*Complexity is the enemy of security*. Complex programs are more difficult to reason about and harder to identify edge cases for. I think that languages like [Viper](https://github.com/ethereum/viper) (maintained by Vitalik Buterin) are a promising step in this direction. Viper includes by default basic security mechanisms, such as bounded looping constructs, no integer overflows, and prevents other basic bugs that developers shouldn't have to reason about.

The less the language lets you do, the easier it is to analyze and prove properties of a contract. Security is hard because the only way to prove a positive statement like "this contract is secure" is to disprove every possible attack vector: "this contract cannot be re-initialized," "its funds cannot be accessed except by the owners," etc. The fewer possible attack vectors you have to consider, the easier it is to develop a secure contract.

A simpler programming model also allows things like [formal verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification) and automatic test generation. These are areas under active research, but just as smart contracts have incorporated cutting-edge cryptography, they also should start incorporating the leading edge of programming language design.

There is a bigger lesson here too.

Most of the programmers who are getting into this space, myself included, come from a web development background, and the blockchain toolchain is designed to be familiar for web developers. Solidity has achieved tremendous adoption in the developer community because of its familiarity to other forms of programming. In a way, this may end up being its downfall.

The problem is, **blockchain programming is fundamentally different from web development**.

Let me explain.

Before the age of the client-server web model, most programming was done for packaged consumer software or on embedded systems. This was before the day of automatic software updates. In these programs, a shipped product was finalâ€”you released one form of your software every 6 months, and if there was a bug, that bug would have to stand until the next release. Because of this longer development cycle, all software releases were rigorously tested under all conceivable circumstances.

Web development is far more forgiving. When you push bad code to a web server, it's not a big deal if there's a critical mistakeâ€”you can just roll back the code, or roll forward with a fix, and all is well because you control the server. Or if the worst happens and there's an active breach or a data leak, you can always stop the bleeding by shutting off your servers and disconnecting yourself from the network.

*These two development models are fundamentally different.* It's only out of something like web development that you can get the motto "move fast and break things."

Most programmers today are trained on the web development model. Unfortunately, the blockchain security model is more akin to the older model.

In blockchain, code is intrinsically unrevertible. Once you deploy a bad smart contract, anyone is free to attack it as long and hard as they can, and there's no way to take it back if they get to it first. Unless you build intelligent security mechanisms into your contracts, if there's a bug or successful attack, there's no way to shut off your servers and fix the mistake. Being on Ethereum by definition means *everyone* owns your server.

A common saying in cybersecurity is "attack is always easier than defense." Blockchain sharply multiplies this imbalance. It's far easier to attack because you have access to the code of every contract, know how much money is in it, and can take as long as you want to try to attack it. And once your attack is successful, you can potentially steal *all of the money* in the contract.

Imagine that you were deploying software for vending machines. But instead of a bug allowing you to simply steal candy from one machine, the bug allowed you to simultaneously steal candy from every machine in the world that employed this software. Yeah, that's how blockchain works.

In the case of a successful attack, defense is extremely difficult. The white-hats in the Parity hack demonstrated how limited their defense options wereâ€”there was no way to secure or dismantle the contracts, or even to hack back the stolen money; all they could do was hack the remaining vulnerable contracts before the attacker did.

This might seem to spell a dark future.

*But I don't think this is a death knell for blockchain programming.* Rather, it confirms what everyone already knows: this ecosystem is young and immature. It's going to take a lot of work to develop the training and discipline to treat smart contracts the way that banks treat their ATM software. But we're going to have to get there for blockchain to be successful in the long run.

This means not just programmers maturing and getting more training. It also means developing tools and languages that make all of this easier, and give us rigorous guarantees about our code.

It's still early. Ethereum is a work in progress, and it's changing rapidly. You should not treat Ethereum as a bank or as a replacement for financial infrastructure. And certainly you should not store any money in a [hot wallet](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hot_wallet) that you're not comfortable losing.

But despite all that, I still think Ethereum is going to win in the long run. And here's why: **the developer community in Ethereum is what makes it so powerful**.

Ethereum will not live or die because of the money in it. It will live or die based on the developers who are fighting for it.

The league of white-hats who came together and defended the vulnerable wallets didn't do it for money. They did it because they believe in this ecosystem. They want Ethereum to thrive. They want to see their vision of the future come true. And after all the speculation and the profiteering, it's ultimately these people who are going to usher the community into its future. They are fundamentally why Ethereum will win in the long runâ€”or if they abandon Ethereum, their abandonment will be why it loses.

This attack is important. It will shake people up. It will force the community to take a long, hard look at security best practices. It will force developers to treat smart contract programming with far more rigor than they currently do.

But this attack hasn't shaken the strength of the builders who are working on this stuff. So in that sense it's a temporary setback.

In the end, attacks like this are good for the community to grow up. They call you to your senses and force you to keep your eyes open. It hurts, and the press will likely make a mess of the story. But every wound makes the community stronger, and gets us closer to really deeply understanding the technology of blockchainâ€”both its dangers, and its amazing potential.

P.S. If youâ€™re a dev and you want to learn more about smart contract security, [this is a really good resource](https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices#known-attacks).

*Errata: This article originally said that Gavin Wood was the developer of the contract, which is incorrect. Gavin is the founder of Parity and pushed the fix to the contract, but was not the original developer. It also originally claimed that $77M additional funds were vulnerable, but this doesnâ€™t count all of the ERC20 (ICO) tokens that were vulnerable. The total amount is actually $150,000,000+ if you include all ERC20 tokens. As of the time of writing this (July 21st 4PM EST), the total value of the assets saved by the white-hats was $179,704,659.*

&ldquo;Poker theory&rdquo; is inherently seductive. In a game full of chaos and uncertainty, poker theory beckons to us, promising comprehensibility and control. But while theory is powerful, it is not a panacea. That's not to say that theory in and of itself is flawed&mdash;rather, that *we* are.

Human beings are only boundedly rational. We are merely approximations of logical thinkers. And yet, we often take it for granted that in any situation, theory will show us a path to the answer.

In this article, we will analyze the limits of poker logic. First, we will look at the nature of heuristics and the function it plays in our cognition. Then we will begin to trace the boundaries of poker language, establish the difference between narrative and discrete poker logic, and lastly, deconstruct the way that poker arguments work in the real world.

It is critically important that we are attentive to our language, and the way we use concepts to guide our decisions. There is a temptation to think about theory in poker the same way one thinks of theory in physics, or some other hard science. By the end of this article, I will demonstrate that theory, for the most part, serves a profoundly weaker (and ultimately different) function in poker.

## The Power of Heuristics

Most of our play in poker is unconscious. This is true even when we are playing our A-games.

We have spoken before of playing on &ldquo;autopilot,&rdquo; as though autopilot is a deviation from your normal poker game. To be more exact, autopilot is more like the *skeleton* of your normal game. Your &ldquo;autopilot&rdquo;&mdash;that is, your unconsciously competent skillset&mdash;is always running in the background when you're playing poker. It's just that when you're on your A-game, there's a lot of conscious activity buzzing on the topmost layer. But your unconscious autopilot is always running beneath it; that remains constant, even when you're playing really well.

Our attention, then, is with that topmost layer&mdash;what is filled into the skeleton when we are consciously thinking about our play. Several things change when we are playing well, including our employment of skills that we haven't unconsciously mastered, frequently accompanied by an increase in patience, but that's not what we're going to focus on now. Instead, we want to look at the stream of internal dialogue that is running through our head.

The chief characteristic of poker theory is that it is mediated through language. So any engagement with poker theory will almost always be processed through our conscious brain. (To be more exact, it is mediated by symbols, including mathematical and linguistic ones).

When we are on our A-game, we are constantly invoking **heuristics**. A heuristic is, to put it simply, a kind of rule of thumb. It is a not-quite-perfect-but-good-enough script that we follow and usually gives us good results. A practical (albeit rather specific) heuristic would be something like, &ldquo;don't check-raise bluff a board like A49r, just float it,&rdquo; or &ldquo;never c-bet air on QT7s,&rdquo; or something more general, such as &ldquo;in a SA/WB situation, try to minimize the pot size.&rdquo; A heuristic is not a mental breakdown of a hand&mdash;it is merely a prefabricated rule to help you get to the answer to a hand that you don't know on an unconscious level.

How do we know when we're using a heuristic, rather than &ldquo;just making plays&rdquo;? After all, we are constantly making good decisions in poker when autopiloting. Most of those decisions are purely unconscious. The mark of using a heuristic rather than merely using our poker perception is that there will usually be some conscious, linguistic thinking involved. If the phrase &ldquo;SA/WB&rdquo; pops into your head, or &ldquo;draw-heavy,&rdquo; or whatever mental language that you happen to use to describe these situations&mdash;this is an indicator that you're invoking a heuristic. They don't always have to be explicitly linguistic; they may be merely symbolic. But for the most part, if you're paying attention, it's easy to spot when you're using a heuristic.

Heuristics are ubiquitous in how we play poker. For every spot where we haven't achieved unconscious mastery, it would take impractically long for us to fully process every scenario and figure out the best play. Heuristics are, in a sense, pre-formulated, simplified rules that help us quickly process many of these situations and approximate the best answer. They work pretty well most of the time. But because they are so widespread, we must be very attentive to how we use them. Bad, unexamined heuristics are often the source of some of our most consistent mistakes.

For example, one heuristic I inattentively used for a long time related to overbets. Whenever a good player overbet, I almost always assumed they were valuebetting. If you asked me why I assumed this, I likely would've cited the language that went along with my heuristic: &ldquo;an overbet is a risky and unpredictable bet, so people usually make it when they're sure of their hand.&rdquo;

Now, certainly, this qualifies as a rationale. It is poker-logical, so to speak. But it's important to note that I wasn't *thinking this through* every time I folded to an overbet. I was simply consulting this heuristic that I had and applying it (or, after long enough, not even remembering the heuristic and simply unconsciously folding to overbets because I perceived them as strong). Consulting a heuristic is a mental shortcut; it simplifies the processing of a hand to conserve our mental energy, which is always limited when playing a long session, multi-tabling, or battling a difficult opponent. But such a lack of reflection makes heuristics an easy place to solidify bad play. In reality, good players *were* overbetting me with bluffs, but because my heuristic was so entrenched, it took me some time to realize this and discard it.

Every player has some of his consistent mistakes and biases embedded into his arsenal of heuristics. This is why creativity and defying your mental walls are so important: in order to break your suboptimal heuristics (which are usually quite old and deeply ingrained), you must go over them with a magnifying glass, to *really* see them for what they are, and then to systematically challenge them. To become a great poker player, you must constantly put your heuristics under assault, and replace old heuristics with newer and sturdier ones.

## Not all Theory is Created Equal

We might say that heuristics are prefabricated molds of theory. They are not theory in and of themselves; heuristics are static. We don't &ldquo;do&rdquo; heuristics, we merely remember them. But they usually derive from theory in some way. So now let's turn to theory itself.

There are two fundamental types of theory. The first is **discrete theory**. Discrete theory is the type of theory that you likely think about when you imagine poker theory. It is discrete, mathematical, and involves things like delineating hand ranges, combinatorials, GTO analysis, breakdowns of stats, and so on. It's the type of thing you do in PokerEV or PokerStove. It involves math, modeling, and explicit assumptions.

Contrary to the popular image, discrete theory is a miniscule part of the poker theory that we actually use.

By far, the largest chunk of poker theory we use is not discrete. It is rather what I call **narrative theory**. Narrative theory is *not* mathematical, but descriptive. It tells a story. It is not scientific, logical, or deterministic&mdash;it is literary. A narrative does not outline all of its assumptions or convert a hand into an analytical model. Instead, it uses established conventions to tell a narrative that leads toward the answer. Narrative theory lies somewhere between heuristic and discrete theory. And it is, by far, the most commonly used type of theory. I would conjecture that almost all of the theoretical thinking that we engage in is narrative. And yet, few acknowledge its role in shaping our approach to poker.

It is comforting to pretend that all theory is equally robust. But if it is true that the vast majority of poker thinking is narrative rather than discrete, then our faith in the comprehensibility of poker is unearned. It suggests that the vast majority of poker theory (and our understanding of this game) is *not* necessarily scientific, logical, or deterministic. Poker becomes more an art than a science. And that is a deeply uncomfortable thought for those who want to believe in the chess game of poker.

## The Arc of Narrative Theory

Take this nugget of theory, taken from an actual explanation of a poker hand (the context is unimportant): &ldquo;His range here is weak, and he just lost a couple big pots, so this is a good spot to bluff.&rdquo; This seems on its face like valid reasoning, doesn't it? This is a very typical example of what is going through our heads when we're thinking about poker&mdash;and this is also very typical narrative theory.

Narrative theory has a few hallmarks:

- It is not immediately&mdash;or sometimes everâ€“falsifiable. That is, it's difficult to point out a single fact that proves any narrative to be incorrect.
- It tends not to explicitly state the assumptions and variables on which it hinges.
- It tends to be much more concise than discrete theory.

To discretely analyze a spot involves complex math, the mapping of assumptions and forking paths through a hand. Narrative theory collapses these complexities. And, as it turns out, that is precisely where its strength lies.

Let's go back to that original explanation. &ldquo;His range here is weak, and he just lost a couple big pots, so this is a good spot to bluff.&rdquo; But let's say that perhaps the opponent knows his range is weak, and thus will be calling more. Or, what if losing big pots is going to make him more call-y? These are two possible counter-narratives that would directly challenge this one. The question is this: how do we decide between them? There are no numbers to compare, nothing to multiply or divide, no pot odds to analyze. How do we decide between the first narrative: &ldquo;villains who just lost big pots tend to call more,&rdquo; and &ldquo;villains who just lost big pots tend to give up more&rdquo;? In a very real way, both of these are valid. If the line of reasoning went, instead: &ldquo;his range here is weak, but he knows that and he just lost a couple big pots, so he's likely to call down light here,&rdquo; this story would also sound rather convincing, wouldn't it?

It can be infuriating, but such ambiguity is inherent to the nature of narrative theory. The strength of narrative theory is its ability to transform a hand into a story&mdash;a simplified narrative that efficiently organizes and condenses the information in a hand. Imagine if we laid out all of the assumptions behind something like &ldquo;I'm going to slowplay my set here because a raise would look too strong.&rdquo; We'd have to first say what his range is going into this hand, what our range is, how we think he'll perceive a turn flat, the likelihood that he'll bluff or valuebet any given river card, how he is going to react to a turn raise, and so on and so forth. Really, when it comes down to it, actually *breaking down* a hand is enormously complex. It involves a lot of paperwork. Narrative theory is, in a sense, a kind of deferral. A form of shorthand.

Behind narrative theory lies the claim, &ldquo;there is some discrete theory that justifies this. I don't have it on me, and I can't show it to you now, but it exists somewhere.&rdquo; Actually doing that discrete theory during a poker hand would be prohibitively taxing, in terms of mental processing and of time. We can't discretely analyze every hand we play. So we must take shortcuts. Narrative theory is the only practical way that we, as human beings, can efficiently organize and recall our knowledge of poker theory.

But how do we actually *generate* a thread of narrative theory?

Narrative theory is composed of building blocks, which we might call **poker memes**. Things like &ldquo;checking back for pot control,&rdquo; or &ldquo;maximizing stack-to-pot ratio,&rdquo; or &ldquo;extracting max value,&rdquo; or &ldquo;betting to induce a bluff.&rdquo; These memes describe interpretations of events in a hand which we, poker theory users, view as valid. That is, these are things that really happen in a hand&mdash;they have a discrete theoretical basis. That does not mean that they happened in *this particular hand you're describing*, but we all agree those are things that happen. They are valid memes. Here are some (usually) invalid memes: &ldquo;I raised for information,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I bet because he was challenging me,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I folded because the hand might be tricky.&rdquo; We don't consider these reasons to be grounded in discrete theory, so we dismiss them. As you can imagine, the language of valid narrative theory has changed as poker has evolved.

Thus, narrative theory is a social phenomenon. It is created by the community of poker players who want to talk about poker, and it is through the poker community that we regulate what is valid narrative theory and what is not. They have a genetic quality&mdash;generally, very strong players (especially vocal ones who make videos or talk openly about their poker thinking) create new memes and foreclose less useful ones, and most other players tend to follow their example. Thus, changes in narrative theory disseminate through the poker community, *not through poker itself*, not through playing or changes in gameplay, but in *social and linguistic changes* that are amplified by prominent community members.

Narrative theory is, in a way, much more interesting and organic than discrete theory. Discrete theory should be the same for two people a world apart, even if they're in totally different player pools. But narrative theory is always different. It is fluid and changing. It adapts to the needs and worldviews of its users. Reading a forum thread from top players just five or six years ago reveals just how much narrative theory has changed in recent years.

For my own part, one realization that came to me later on in my poker career was this: one of the most valuable things that is communicated through poker videos (and the reason why they're invaluable for learning) is that they are so good at teaching narrative theory. In fact, most of what I think I gave away in all of the videos I was making was not actually my poker strategy, or the individual plays I made. I think the usefulness of my videos lay, instead, in *how* I talked about poker. Think about it. There are some videos that discretely analyze situations in hands, break things down into math and PokerEV and so on, but really, they are the minority&mdash;the majority of videos see a hand, quickly give a narrative explanation, and then move on.

Of course, once you start to see this, your instinct might be to think that you're getting ripped off. Discrete theory is what you really want, isn't it? On the contrary. One of the most powerful things we learn from videos is *how better to apply narrative theory*.

Narrative theory is much more important than discrete theory when it comes to regulating our play because we rarely have the time to apply discrete theory during an actual hand! If 95% of our play is regulated by narrative theory, then simply being able to listen to other people's narrative theory, examining and regurgitating their language, and internalizing the *rules* with which they combine and chain together memes, we learn to become better at narrative theory. If Phil Galfond checks back top pair on a flop, his breaking down the math and discretely analyzing the hand is, actually, of little value. But what is immensely valuable is learning the memes, the rules of narrative theory that Phil Galfond is applying, and learning to apply them yourself. It is a curious thing&mdash;you take a bad player, teach him to simply *talk* about poker better, and he suddenly becomes a better player.

Narrative theory is not deterministic. By learning the language of a better player, such as a coach or a videomaker, you won't necessarily play like him. But listening to and engaging with such a coach may teach you how to tell stories like him&mdash;a concept known in psychology as **scaffolding**. Your coach's style of narrative theory emphasizes the a particular hierarchy of concepts&mdash;embedded within his language is his idea of what concepts are most important in a hand, which things to look for first, and which patterns should trigger which responses. In the same way our parents engage in scaffolding to teach us how to tell stories as children (e.g., &ldquo;and why did Billy do that? How did that make you feel? And then what did you do?&rdquo;), getting coaching and watching videos guides us toward constructing good poker narratives in much the same way.

It would be incorrect to claim, however, that narrative theory is *all* that we're doing when we're playing poker. There is also some discrete theory involved, especially as your game improves to a high level. Estimating pot odds, analyzing how to optimize against a given hand (given certain assumptions about his play), logical hand-elimination to narrow down his range, or even holistically strategizing on how to allocate your hand range in a certain spot&mdash;these things may well fall under the purview of discrete theory, which strong players are continually applying during their play. But no matter what level you're at, narrative theory is always the dominant mode of theory we employ in poker hands. There is simply no other method as efficient at encoding the large swathes of information contained in poker. Narrative theory is, in a very real sense, the human answer to complexity.

## Arguing over Stories

So let's say that you begrudgingly accept the validity of narrative theory as I've presented it. Okay, you say, maybe this is how it works. So what?

I've been very steadfast in claiming that narrative theory has many advantages, and is essential to our ability to parse the complexity of poker. But, of course, narrative theory has its drawbacks.

Inherent to its nature, narrative theory cannot be logically argued. There are some narrative disputes that can be resolved verbally, such as demonstrating two inconsistent memes were strung together, breaking the rules of narrativity. For example, there might be a narrative that includes both &ldquo;he couldn't've had a draw on the flop, because he loves to checkraise them&rdquo; and &ldquo;on the river he never bluffs big, so he had to have hit his draw.&rdquo; The rules of narrative theory disallow this combination, and others. Inconsistencies like this, however, are not terribly common once you reach a certain level of mastery over poker theory.

More often, when people are arguing about a poker narrative, it is not resolved by the narratives themselves. After all, narratives are incommensurate&mdash;they cannot be evaluated objectively, and each participant believes their own narrative (it should be no surprise that when we share hands, we always label ourselves the hero and our opponent the villain).When such disputes arise, they are often resolved by an appeal to authority&mdash;the players will go to a third party, another trusted poker player, to decide which narrative is best aligned with authority.

In fact, once you start seeing this phenomenon, you will start seeing it everywhere&mdash;especially in poker forums. What is a typical strategy thread, after all? An opening poster shows a hand, and then every subsequent poster takes a shot at communicating their own narrative of what's going on in the hand. This should seem like chaos, and yet usually when we read such a thread, we have an idea of which narrative &ldquo;won.&rdquo; How do we decide that?

There are three ways. First, if there is no consensus, we tend to ally ourselves with the narrative that most closely resembles our own. Second, if there is a consensus, then we choose the narrative that is most popular with the best players (which is a sign of fitness). This is often the way that narrative theory works. We observe a narrative somewhere in the wild, and from the fact that it's alive and well&mdash;by the evolutionary principle&mdash;we assume it must be strategically fit.

This is the basis of what I call **ecological learning.** There are three fundamental modes of learning in poker: learning through theory, learning via experience, and learning through observing others&mdash;ecological learning. Through this type of learning, you learn from &ldquo;what's out there&rdquo; or &ldquo;what people are doing&rdquo; (under the presumption that weak strategies would be culled out from the population). Thus, through ecological learning, popularity is an effective measure of a theory's fitness. Going back to the forum thread&mdash;the third possibility is that a poker authority weighs in to choose among these narratives, or possibly offer his own (which, if he does, we take as an even stronger sign of fitness). Let's say, for example, that Sauce or Jungleman weighs in. If they say something like &ldquo;this is a definite fold,&rdquo; this doesn't really qualify as narrative theory, it's simply a stand-in for a statement like this: &ldquo;this is a fold, and I've done (either explicitly or intuitively) the data analysis that tells me on average, folding is better than calling/raising.&rdquo; But if they offer their own explanation of the hand, then their narrative inevitably becomes the dominant one that later posters accept.

Rarely are these things decided by application of discrete theory, comparing mathematical models of the hands and assumptions and so on. Really, once you look at it this way, the art of poker argument can seem almost simplistic.

As a student of poker, if you were anything like I was, you will get into many arguments about poker. When you find something you disagree with, or which doesn't seem to make sense to you, it is good to challenge it. Debating poker theory will nourish your mind. But, especially as a developing player, you should be wary of arguments that begin and end in narrative theory.

At its core, all of narrative theory carries with it an implied warranty. The warranty is: &ldquo;somewhere out there, someone did some discrete theory to prove this works.&rdquo; Usually, this warranty goes unquestioned. But if you are engaged in a debate about poker, it is time for you to call this out. When someone makes a narrative claim that you deeply disagree with&mdash;challenge them to prove it. Don't accept it at their word! Or, if you have good reason to trust their authority, then take the time to prove it to yourself. As much as I've been stressing narrative theory as essential to our development, the ability to do discrete theory is important as well. Especially now, as poker evolves and games get more and more rigorous, the precision in strategy that can be captured by narrative theory is often not enough.

To reach the highest levels, you must gain a mastery of both discrete and narrative theory. And the only way to do that is to practice them. Learn how to run simulations. Learn how to use PokerEV, or StoxEV. If you don't know how to run basic programs like PokerStove, or how to do fold equity calculations, or how to calculate a GTO river strategy&mdash;learn them. Knowledge of discrete theory only bolsters your narrative theory, and helps you to know which structures in your poker game are sound, and which are more suspect.

Discrete analysis is the bedrock of theory, always. In the end, narrative theory is merely a stand-in, and so you must be willing to not only call others out when their stories don't add up, but also to scrutinize the concepts you employ in your own game. Narrative theory is merely the roadmap we sketch atop the true terrain of discrete theory.

But there are some situations which, no matter how hard we try, are insuperably complex, and cannot be broken down by discrete theory. PLO has many such situations. When you have a pair and a mediocre draw on a flop, is it better to lead out, or check/call? Is it better to flat it in a 3-bet pot, or raise the flop? What if stacks are deep? All of these variables will certainly affect the answer&mdash;but we don't know *how*. We have no idea where any of the cut-offs are for these variables, because PLO is such a combinatorially complex game, which makes mapping out a decision tree effectively impossible.

I remember once getting into a very tricky PLO flop situation. I couldn't figure out how to analyze the hand, so I took it to a number of world-class PLO players I knew. To my surprise, I kept getting different answers from anyone on the best way to play it&mdash;on the flop, one of the earliest streets, it baffled me that there could be so much disagreement! I was frustrated, but also fascinated. In reality, nobody who I took the hand to could actually break down the hand either&mdash;mathematically, it would be overwhelmingly complex to even try. The only way to defend a particular way of playing the hand was narratively. Essentially, I realized I was being told two different stories&mdash;and the only way I could decide between them was to pick one and go with it.Even with all its complications and imperfections, we need narrative theory. Although it can seem hopelessly convoluted at times, we have no alternative but to engage in the circus of narrativity, debate, and reason-giving. You must embrace the way that poker works. Only then can you navigate the world as it is, and develop your skills as a poker player.

You could say that, in a sense, it's incidental that math can model poker. After all, you can mathematically model the physics behind tennis, but physics has little to do with the process of learning tennis. I suspect that the same is largely true of poker. Most of the learning that we do in poker has little to do with the chess match. What we are playing is something vague and large, it is played in large strokes of thoughts, it is not transmitted through equations and proofs, but through stories and emulation. If poker couldn't be modeled by mathematics, then storytelling would be all we'd have to make sense of the game. Perhaps that's closer to reality than we think.

In the end, poker theory tells us about a lot more than just poker. It tells us about ourselves, the way our minds work, and the way that we interact with other members of our community. In the next article, we are going to look at this latter phenomenon, with an eye toward the practical. What kind of relationship should we have with the poker community? Poker is an intensely isolating and isolated profession, and yet, we would be helpless without a community of peers to guide our learning in the right direction. In the next article, I will discuss the poker community, and how to successfully develop and foster a poker network, and how to stay sane in a less-than-sane culture.

When [the story of how I landed a job at Airbnb](https://haseebq.com/farewell-app-academy-hello-airbnb-part-i/) went viral, I was surprised at how infatuated people were with my negotiations. Media stories portrayed me as some kind of master negotiator&mdash;a wily ex-poker-player who was able to con the tech giants into a lucrative job offer.

This is silly. It's silly for a lot of reasons, but one of the main ones is that in reality, my negotiation skills are nothing special. There are lots of job candidates who are better negotiators than I, to speak nothing of recruiters and other professional negotiators.

It just so happens that most people don't negotiate at all, or if they do, they just negotiate just enough to satisfy themselves that they did.

Worse yet, most of the advice out there on negotiation is borderline useless. Almost anything you read on the subject will be a vague and long-winded exhortation to &ldquo;make sure you negotiate&rdquo; and &ldquo;never say the first number.&rdquo; Beyond those two morsels of advice, you're pretty much on your own.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v1xrgXHfrFo/">[video]</div>

I thought to myself: why is there so little actionable advice out there about negotiation? I suspect it's because deep down, many people believe that negotiation is inexplicable, that it's something some people can do and others can't, and that there's no real way to break it down so anyone can learn it.

I say that's bullshit. Negotiation is a skill that can be learned just like any other, and I don't believe it's particularly elusive or hard to understand. So I'm going to try to explain how anyone can do it.

Three caveats.

First: I'm not an expert. There are people who really are experts at this, and when my advice contradicts theirs, you should assume I'm wrong.

Second: negotiation is tricky to generalize about because it's deeply intertwined with social dynamics and power. The appropriate advice for an Asian male in Silicon Valley may not be appropriate for a black woman in Birmingham, Alabama. Racial, sexual, and political dynamics accompany you to the negotiating table.

At the same time, I want to caution against overemphasizing these factors. Being afraid to negotiate out of fear of discrimination can often be just as deleterious as discrimination itself.

Ceteris paribus, negotiate aggressively.

Third: I'm the first to admit that negotiation is stupid. It's a practice that inherently benefits those who are good at it, and is an absurd axis on which to reward people. But it's a reality of our economic system. And like most collective action problems, we're probably not going to be able to abolish it any time soon. In which case, you might as well improve at it.

So here's my guide to negotiation. It's going to be split into two parts: this first part will be about conceptualizing the negotiating process, about how to begin the process and set yourself up for maximal success. The second part will be advice on the actual back-and-forth portion of negotiating and how to ask for what you want.

Let's take it from the top.

## What it means to &ldquo;get a job&rdquo;

In our culture we call entering the employment market &ldquo;trying to get a job.&rdquo; This is an unfortunate turn of phrase. &ldquo;Getting a job&rdquo; implies that jobs are a resource out in the world, and you're attempting to secure one of these resources. But that's completely backwards. What you are actually doing is selling your labor, and a company is bidding for it.

**Employment is just striking a mutual deal in the labor market.**

Like any market, the labor market only functions well if it's competitive. This is the only way to ensure fair and equitable pricing. Imagine you were a farmer selling watermelons. Would you just sell your watermelons to the first buyer who agreed to purchase them? Or would you survey the marketplace of buyers, see the best price (and business partner) you could get, and then make an informed decision on which buyer to sell to?

And yet, when people talk about the labor market, they think &ldquo;oh, a company wants to *give me a job*! What a relief!&rdquo; As though having a job were in itself some special privilege for which a company is the gatekeeper.

Dispel yourself of this mindset.

A job is just a deal. It is a deal between you and a company to exchange labor for money (and other things you value).

This might sound like an abstract point, but you should absolutely approach negotiation from this perspective.

## The role of negotiation

Negotiating is a natural and expected part of the process of trying to make a deal. It's also a signal of competence and seriousness. Companies generally respect candidates who negotiate, and most highly attractive candidates negotiate (if for no other reason, because they often have too many options to choose from).

At the risk of spouting truisms: always, always negotiate. Doesn't matter how good or bad you think you are. You never damage a relationship by negotiating.

In all my time as an instructor at App Academy, out of hundreds of offers negotiated, only once or twice were offers ever rescinded in negotiations. It basically never happens. And when it does, usually the candidate was being an unconscionable asshole, or the company was imploding and needed an excuse to rescind the offer.

You might think to yourself: &ldquo;*well, I don't want to set high expectations, and the offer is already generous, so I ought to just take it.*&ldquo;

**No. Negotiate.**

Or maybe: &ldquo;*I don't want to start off on the wrong foot and look greedy with my future employer.*&ldquo;

**No. Negotiate.**

&ldquo;*But this company is small and&mdash;*&ldquo;

**No. Shut up. Negotiate.**

We'll talk more in the next section about why a lot of these objections are bullshit, and fundamentally misapprehend the dynamics of hiring. But for now, just trust me that you should always negotiate.

## The ten rules of negotiating

I've tried to boil down negotiation to ten rules. The rules, in order of appearance, are:

1. Get everything in writing
2. Always keep the door open
3. Information is power
4. Always be positive
5. Don't be the decision maker
6. Have alternatives
7. Proclaim reasons for everything
8. Be motivated by more than just money
9. Understand what they value
10. Be winnable

We'll only get through some of these in this blog post, and the rest will appear in the second part. But I'll explain each rule as we get to it.

So let's start from the top and try to walk through a negotiation process from the very beginning. For most, that starts when you receive an offer.

## The offer conversation

You've just received the phone call: your interview went well, and after much deliberation they decided they like you. They want to make you an offer. Congratulations!

Don't get too excited though. The fun is just getting started.

Thank your recruiter. Sound excited&mdash;hopefully this won't be hard. Before jumping into details, try to ask for specific feedback on your interview performance. If they give it to you, this will help you gauge how much they want you, as well as tell you things you can improve on in your next interview(s).

Now time to explore the offer.

**Rule #1 of negotiating: have everything in writing.**

Eventually, they'll give you information about the offer. Write it all down. Doesn't matter if they're going to send you a written version later, **write everything down**. Even if there are things that are not directly monetary, if they relate to the job, write them down. If they tell you &ldquo;we're working on porting the front-end to Angular,&rdquo; write that down. If they say they have 20 employees, write that down. You want as much information as you can. You'll forget a lot of this stuff, and it's going to be important in informing your final decision.

Depending on the company, they'll also tell you about the equity package. We'll look more specifically at equity in part II, but be sure to write everything down.

The rule from here on out is that everything significant you discuss will have some kind of a paper trail. Often, the company won't even send you an official offer letter until a deal is finalized. So it falls to you to confirm all of the important details in subsequent e-mails.

So yadda yadda, lots of details, writing stuff down, oh there's a joke, time to laugh. Now the recruiter is done talking and you're done asking all of your questions.

Your recruiter will now say something along the lines of &ldquo;*so what do you think?*&ldquo;

This seems innocuous, but your reply here is critical, because there's a lot you can say to weaken your position. This is your first decision point.

A decision point is a moment in the negotiation where your interlocutor wants to compel you to make a decision. If they succeed in tying you to a position, they will close the door on further negotiating. Of course &ldquo;what do you think?&rdquo; is a subtle prod. But it is the beginning of many attempts to get you to make a premature commitment.

**This leads to rule #2 of negotiating: always keep the door open.** Never give up your negotiating power until you're absolutely ready to make an informed, deliberate final decision.

This means your job is to traverse as many of these decision points as possible without giving up the power to continue negotiating. Very frequently, your interlocutor will try to trick you into making a decision, or tie you to a decision you didn't commit to. You must keep verbally jiu-jitsu-ing out of these antics until you're actually ready to make your final decision.

## Protecting information

There's an uncomfortable silence by now, and their &ldquo;*what do you think?*&rdquo; is hanging in the air.

If you say &ldquo;*yes, that sounds amazing, when do I start?*&rdquo; you implicitly accept the offer and completely close the door on the negotiation. This is your recruiter's number one favorite thing to hear. It stands to reason you probably shouldn't do this.

But their second favorite thing to hear you say is &ldquo;*can you do 90K instead of 85K?*&rdquo; This also closes the door, but for a different and more subtle reason. And it's the number one reason why most people suck at negotiation.

**Rule #3 of negotiating: information is power.** To protect your power in the negotiation, you must protect information as much as possible.

A company doesn't give you insight into what it's thinking. It doesn't tell you its price range, how much it paid the previous candidate with your experience, or anything like that. It intentionally obfuscates those things. But it wants you not to do the same.

A company wants to be like a bidder in a secret auction. But unlike the other bidders, it wants to know exactly how high all of the other bids are. It then openly intends to exploit that knowledge, often by bidding one cent more than the second highest bid.

Yeah, no. Screw that. It's a silent auction, and to keep it that way, you must protect information.

In many situations, the only reason why you have any negotiating power at all is because the employer doesn't actually know what you're thinking. They might not know how good your other offers are, or how much you were making in your last job, or how you weigh salary vs equity, or even how rational you are as a decision-maker. Bottom line, you want them to be uncertain on exactly what it would take to sign you.

When you say &ldquo;*can you do 90K instead of 85K,*&rdquo; you've told them exactly what it will take to make you sign. The sheet's pulled back, the secret auction is up, and they're going to bid 90K (or more likely, 87K). And they know there's almost no risk in doing so, because you'll probably accept.

What if you were the kind of person who wouldn't even consider an offer below 110K? Or the kind of person who wouldn't consider an offer below 120K? If you were, you wouldn't ask for 90K, and if they offered it as conciliation, you'd tell them to stop wasting your time.

By staying silent, *they don't actually know which of those kinds of people you are.* In their mind, you could be any of the three.

A corollary of this rule is that you should not reveal to companies what you're currently making. There are some exceptions, but as a rule you should assume this. If you must divulge what you're making, you should be liberal in noting the total value of your package (incorporate bonuses, unvested stock, nearness to promotion etc.), and always mention it in a context like &ldquo;*[XYZ] is what I'm currently making, and I'm definitely looking for a step up in my career for my next role.*&ldquo;

Companies will ask about your current compensation at different stages in the process&mdash;some before they ever interview you, some after they decide to make you an offer. But be mindful of this, and protect information.

So given this offer, don't ask for more money or equity or anything of the sort. Don't comment on any specific details of the offer except to clarify them.

Give away nothing. Retain your power.

Say instead: &ldquo;*Yeah, [COMPANY_NAME] sounds great! I really thought this was a good fit, and I'm glad that you guys agree. Right now I'm talking with a few other companies so I can't speak to the specific details of the offer until I'm done with the process and get closer to making a decision. But I'm sure we'll be able to find a package that we're both happy with, because I really would love to be a part of the team.*&ldquo;

Think like the watermelon farmer. This offer is just is the first businessman who's stopped by your watermelon patch, glanced over your crops, and announced &ldquo;I'll take all of these right now for $2 a melon.&rdquo;

Cool. It's a big market, and you're patient&mdash;you're a farmer after all. Just smile and tell them you'll keep their offer in mind.

And this is super important: always be unequivocally positive.

## The importance of positivity

**Staying positive is rule #4 of negotiation**. Even if the offer is shit, it's extremely important to remain positive and excited about the company. This is because *your excitement is one of your most valuable assets in a negotiation.*

A company is making you an offer because they think you'll do hard work for them if they pay you. If you lose your excitement for the company during the interview process, then they'll lose confidence that you'll actually want to work hard or stay there for a long time. Each of those makes you less attractive as an investment. Remember, you are the product! If you become less excited, then the product you're selling actually loses value.

Imagine you were negotiating with someone over buying your watermelons, but the negotiation took so long that by the time you'd reached an agreement, your watermelons had gone bad.

Companies are terrified of that. They don't want their candidates to go bad during a negotiation. Hence why they hire professional recruiters to manage the process and make sure they remain amicable. You and the recruiter share the same interest in that regard. If a company feels like you've gone bad, suddenly they're a lot less willing to pay for you.

So despite whatever is happening in the negotiation, give the company the impression that 1) you still like the company, and that 2) you're still excited to work there, even if the numbers or the money or the timing is not working out. Generally the most convincing thing to signal this is to reiterate you love the mission, the team, or the problem they're working on, and really want to see things work out.

## Don't be the decision-maker

You can wrap up the conversation now by saying:

> I'll look over some of these details and discuss it with my [FAMILY/CLOSE\\\\_FRIENDS/SIGNIFICANT\\\\_OTHER]. I'll reach out to you if I have any questions. Thanks so much for sharing the good news with me, and I'll be in touch!

So not only are you ending the conversation with the power all in your hands, but note there's another important move here: you're roping in other decision-makers.

**Rule #5 of negotiation: don't be the decision-maker.** Even if you don't particularly care what your friends/family/husband/mother thinks, by mentioning them, you're no longer the only person the recruiter needs to win over. There's no point in them trying to bully and intimidate you; the &ldquo;true decision-maker&rdquo; is beyond their reach.

This is a classic technique in customer support and remediation. It's never the person on the phone's fault, they're just some poor schmuck doing their job. It's not their decision to make. This helps to defuse tension and give them more control of the situation.

It's much harder to pressure someone if they're not the final decision-maker. So take advantage of that.

Okay!

We have our first offer. Send a follow-up e-mail confirming all of the details you discussed with your recruiter so you have a paper trail. Just say &ldquo;*just wanted to confirm I had all the details right.*&ldquo;

Groovy. Next step is to leverage this to land other offers and find the best deal we can find in the job market.

## Getting other offers

Turns out, it doesn't matter that much where your first offer is from, or even how much they're offering you. Just having an offer in hand will get the engine running.

If you're already in the pipeline with other companies (which you should be if you're doing it right), you should proactively reach out and let them know that you've just received an offer. Try to build a sense of urgency. Regardless of whether you know the expiration date, all offers expire at some point, so take advantage of that.

> Hello [PERSON],
>
> I just wanted to update you on my own process. I've just received an offer from [COMPANY] which is quite strong. That said, I'm really excited about [YOUR AMAZING COMPANY] and really want to see if we can make it work. Since my timeline is now compressed, is there anything you can do to expedite the process?

Should you specifically mention the company that gave you an offer? Depends. If it's a well-known company or a competitor, then definitely mention it. If it's a no-name or unsexy company, you should just say you received an offer. If it's expiring soon, you should mention that as well.

Either way, send out a letter like this to every single company you're talking to. No matter how hopeless or pointless you think your application is, you want to send this signal to everyone who is considering you in the market.

Second, if there are any other companies you are looking to apply to (whether through referral or cold application), or even companies at which you've already applied but haven't heard back, I would also follow up with a similar e-mail.

So why do this? Isn't this tacky, annoying, or even desperate?

None of the above. It is the oldest method in history to galvanize a marketplace&mdash;show that supplies are limited and build urgency. Demand breeds demand. Not every company will respond to this, but many will.

Isn't it stupid that companies respond to this though?

## Why companies care about other offers

[When I wrote about the story of my own job search](https://haseebq.com/farewell-app-academy-hello-airbnb-part-i/), I mentioned how having an offer from Google made companies turn around and expedite me through their funnels. Many commentators lamented at the capriciousness of these companies. If Uber or Twitch only talked to me because of Google and until then weren't willing to look at me, what did that say about their hiring processes? What legitimately are they evaluating, if anything at all?

I think this response is totally backwards. The behavior of tech companies here is actually very rational, and you would do well to understand it.

First, you must realize what a company's goal is. A company's goal is to hire someone who will become an effective employee and produce more value than their cost. How do you figure out who will do that? Well, you can't know for certain without actually hiring them, but there are a few proxies. Pedigree is the strongest signal; if they did it at other companies, they can probably do it at yours. And if someone trusted within the organization can vouch for them, that's often a strong signal as well.

But turns out, almost everything else is a weak signal. Weak in the sense that it's just not very reliable. Interviews, if you think about it, are long, sweaty, uncomfortable affairs that only glancingly resemble actual employment. They're weird and can't tell you that much about whether an individual will be a good at their job. There's no way around this. There are a few stronger signals, like bringing someone in for a week or two on a contract-to-hire position, but strong candidates won't consider this. So candidates as a whole have effectively forced companies to assume almost all of the risk in hiring.

The truth is, knowing that someone has passed your interview just doesn't say *that much* about whether they'll be a good employee. It's as though you knew nothing about a student other than their SAT score. It's just not a lot of data to go off.

Nobody has solved this problem. Not Google nor anyone else.

And this is precisely why it's rational for companies to care that you've received other offers. They care because each company knows that their own process is noisy, and the processes of most other companies are also noisy. But a candidate having multiple offers means that they have multiple weak signals in their favor. Combined, these converge into a much stronger signal than any single interview. It's like knowing that a student has a strong SAT score, and GPA, and won various scholarships. Sure, it's still possible that they're a dunce, but it's much harder for that to be true.

This is not to say that companies respond proportionally to these signals, or that they don't overvalue credentials and brands. They do. But caring about whether you have other offers and valuing you accordingly is completely rational.

So this is all to say&mdash;tell other companies that you've received offers. Give them more signal so that they know you're a valued and compelling candidate. And understand why this changes their mind about whether to interview you.

As you continue interviewing, remember to keep practicing your interview skills. The single strongest determinant of your final offer will be the number and strength of offers that you receive.

## Some advice on timing

You want to be strategic about the timing of your offers. Generally, you should try to start interviewing at larger companies earlier. Their processes are slower and their offer windows are wider (meaning they allow you more time to decide). Startups are the other way around.

Your goal should be to have as many offers overlapping at the same time as possible. This will maximize your window for negotiating.

When you receive an offer, often the first thing you should ask for is more time to make your decision. Especially in your first offer, more time is by far the most valuable thing you can ask for. It's time that enables you to activate other companies and end up with the strongest possible offer. So be prepared to fight for time.

## How to approach exploding offers

Hoo boy.

Exploding offers are offers that expire within 24-72 hours. You won't see this much at big companies, but they're becoming increasingly common among startups and mid-sized companies.

Exploding offers suck, and I share most people's disdain for this practice. But I do understand it. Exploding offers are a natural weapon for employers to combat a strong hiring market for tech workers. Companies know exactly what they're doing with exploding offers&mdash;they play on fear and limit your ability to seek out counteroffers.

In a sense, it's unsurprising that if startups have more difficulty attracting and securing talent, they'd resort to this practice. What I don't like is the dishonesty about it. Employers often justify this by saying &ldquo;*If you need more time than this, then that's a sign you're not the kind of person we're looking for.*&ldquo;

Please don't buy this crap or feel guilty over it. They're simply doing this to improve their chance of closing candidates. Needing more than three days to make a life decision isn't a sign of anything other than thoughtfulness.

So what should you do if you receive an exploding offer?

Exploding offers are anathema to your ability to effectively navigate the labor market. Thus, there is only one thing to do. Treat the offer as a non-offer unless the expiration window is widened.

In no uncertain terms, convey that if the offer is exploding, it's useless to you.

Example conversation:

> I have one big concern. You mentioned that this offer explodes in 48 hours. I'm afraid this doesn't work at all for me. There's no way that I can make a decision on this offer within a 48 hour window. I'm currently wrapping up my interview process at a few other companies, which is likely to take me another week or so. So I'm going to need more time to make an informed decision.

If they push back and say this is the best they can do, then politely reply:

> That's really unfortunate. I like [YOUR COMPANY] and was really excited about the team, but like I said, there's no way I can consider this offer. 48 hours just too unreasonable of a window. The next company I join will be a big life decision for me, and I take my commitments very seriously. I also need to consult with my [EXTERNAL\\\\_DECISION\\\\_MAKER]. There's no way that I can make a decision I'm comfortable with in this short an amount of time.

Pretty much any company will relent at this point. If they persist, don't be afraid to walk away over it. (They probably won't let that happen, and will come grab you as you're walking out the door. But if they don't, then honestly, screw 'em.)

I was given several exploding offers during my job search. And every time, I did essentially this. Every single offer immediately widened to become more reasonable, sometimes by several weeks.

I want to emphasize, lest I be misunderstood here&mdash;what I'm saying is not to just silently let an exploding offer expire, and assume that everything will be fine and they'll still hire you. They won't. For exploding offers to be a credible weapon, a company has to have a reputation of enforcing them. I'm saying explicitly call this out as an issue when they make the offer.

Don't let a company bully you into giving away your negotiating power.

## The Negotiating Mindset

Before we enter into the actual back-and-forth, I want to examine the mindset you should have as a negotiator. This applies not just to how you approach the conversation, but also to how you think about the company.

Do not fall into the trap of valuing companies solely along one dimension. That means don't just value companies based on salary, equity, or even on prestige. Those are all important dimensions, but so are cultural fit, the challenge of the work, learning potential, later career options, quality of life, growth potential, and just overall happiness. None of these inherently trump any of the other. Anyone who tells you &ldquo;just choose wherever you think you'll be happiest&rdquo; is being just as simplistic than someone who says &ldquo;just choose the one that offers the most money.&rdquo; All of these things matter, and your decision should be genuinely multi-dimensional.

Be open to being surprised as you explore different companies.

It's also important to understand that companies don't all value you along the same dimension either. That is, different companies are genuinely looking for different skills, and there are some companies at which you will be more and less valuable. Even at peer companies this is true, especially so if you have a specialized skill-set.

The more companies you talk to, the more likely you are to find a company to which you are significantly more valuable than the rest. Chances are this is where you'll be able to negotiate your strongest offer. It might surprise you which company this turns out to be; keep an open mind, and remember that a job search is a 2-sided process.

One of the most valuable things you can do for yourself in this process is to really try to understand how employers think and what motivates them. Understanding your interlocutor is extremely important in negotiation, and we'll be exploring that a lot in the next blog post.

But most of all I want to emphasize: be curious about the other side. Try to understand why employers think the way they do. Be sympathetic toward them. Care about what they want and help them try to get it. Adopting this mindset will make you a much stronger negotiator, and accordingly, a much better employee and team member.

Okay. That's as far as we're going for today. In the next blog post, I'm going to cover the last four rules of negotiation. I'll also go over the actual back-and-forth process&mdash;how to ask for what you want, how to strengthen offers, and how to dismantle the tricks that companies will try to pull on you. Also a lot more on the theory of negotiation, which I really dig.
