Poker cannot be played alone. For a game to be dealt, you must have other players to battle, to deceive, to outmaneuver, to control. And yet, every hand of poker you are ever dealt you will play alone.

No one else is in your corner. You may find sympathy in others, encouragement, words of wisdom. But you know they have no stake in your success. You are the only one who will feel your swings. Your ups and downs belong only to you.

Poker is played alone.

And yet, there exists a poker community: a collection of self-interested individuals who nevertheless teach one another, help each other grow, share ideas, feelings, stories. They sacrifice their time, their knowledge, and their EV to help one another. Why?

In this article, we will try to make sense of the poker community. First we will try to answer the question of how and why it exists. Then, more practically, we will look at advice on how best to get value out of the poker community, how to forge healthy poker connections, the value of coaching and mentorship, and how to exist sanely in the culture of gambling.

Let's begin with the first question, the one which has always fascinated me most. Perhaps the most fundamental axiom of poker is: &ldquo;always maximize EV.&rdquo; We internalize this from the beginnings of our careers. So why does something seemingly so at odds with that&mdash;the poker community, with its sharing information, helping other players&mdash;exist at all?

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NLb8jWYvYmU">[video]</div>

## Why Money Matters

The culture of poker offers us a strange system of values. First, we are meant to be dispassionate toward money in poker. They're just chips&mdash;we are supposed to be detached and objective. And yet, at the same time, we are supposed to be driven, to the point of obsession, in maximizing our EV.

If we're not supposed to care about money, how can we be monomaniacal about EV? And more importantly, why would we be?

Poker culture teaches us to protect information, to look out for ourselves, to be indifferent to up and downs. Here, the ideal human being is the ruthlessly selfish one. Poker drives us apart. After all, when you win a big pot from someone, there is no fanfare, nobody to congratulate you, no handshake at the end. Once you win a pot from someone, the only recognition you get is the new enemy you've made, sitting across the table from you.

Money is not important, we are told. Money is not the end. Then what is?

As in any other human endeavor&mdash;other people are the end. It is only through the poker culture that having a 6bb/100 winrate, or making an amazing hero call, or being the biggest winner at $2/$4 for a month becomes an accomplishment. Without other people to care about those things, they would simply be arbitrary facts. But here, they mean something. The poker culture instils us with a value system, it gives us a reason why money is important, why bb/100, and non-showdown winnings, and hero calls, and marathon sessions, and minute questions of poker theory&mdash;why they all matter. It is thus that the stories of poker are created and imbued with meaning. As humans, we need actualization, and poker culture gives us that.

This is why the poker culture *must* exist. Through it, a dry monetary gain is transformed into an accomplishment, something laudable, even noble. It is chiefly through the poker culture that your success truly matters. Your skill, your fame, your journey&mdash;in reality, they mean very little to the outside world.

Yes, you would be making money. But in a vacuum, making money means very little. Poker culture is the logos; the source of values. I contend that without the poker world, much of poker would be meaningless.

That is not to say that this is good or bad. It is simply how it is. And it is also not to say that you must derive *all* of your values from poker culture (there are some who do, and many who don't). But all of us who participate seriously in the journey of poker are in orbit of the poker culture. It's the sun that both propels us in different directions, and holds us together.

## The Value of Sharing Information

Somewhere in your education as a poker player, you learned that you have to protect information. You probably can't pinpoint where exactly you learned this. I certainly can't. It's one of those ideas that's so deeply ingrained into the culture of poker that it seems to have always existed.

Of course, you should protect information. Information is important. It's EV. Money. We realize the wisdom of this caution, and so we generally follow it. But we don't always. We *do* share information sometimes. We gush to other people about our poker ideas. We show hands instead of mucking. We discuss theory at the table. We trash talk. We post hand advice in forums and help out our friends when they have a tough spot. Really, we share information all the time.

Our desire to share information stems from our desire to commune&mdash;to participate in the poker community. In a sense, sharing information is the only way to puncture the veil between you and another human being. Those are the moments we brush our minds against others&mdash;we get to *feel* poker. After all, the game is not much fun without other people to play with.

This is not to suggest that you shouldn't protect information. It's important. You probably shouldn't show hands, you really shouldn't trash talk, and you definitely shouldn't discuss theory at the table (unless, of course, any of these are done strategically). But sharing information on the whole is very, very important. In fact, if you want to become a great poker player, it is absolutely essential, because it is the only real way to build a healthy and supportive poker network.

## How to Build a Village

When I first started playing poker, I was alone. I had no one to share my ideas with. I had no friend climbing up poker alongside me. After several months, I finally gained a companion or two, but it would always happen that, as I improved and climbed up the stakes, I continually left my poker friends behind. Almost always, I would become the best player within my circle, and would have to search for new companions who were stronger players.

I was not lucky in how I started poker. I knew none of the right people. It took me a long time to find good resources. I had no gifted companions to rise up stakes alongside me. I never won any tournaments, and could not deposit more than once. And yet, I quickly became successful. If you asked me why I think I became good at poker, I would give a few answers&mdash;obsession, competitiveness, intelligence. But really, those things alone are not enough. What truly saved me, I believe, was my ability to make connections with other poker thinkers.

That's not to suggest that I was great at it, by any means. I was 16 when I started poker, and woefully dense. But if I did not possess this skill, I suspect I would have had no chance at all of success.

It takes a village to raise a child&mdash;and to raise a poker player. You *have* to reach out to people. You *have* to find people to talk poker with. People to bounce ideas off, to learn from, to encourage you and make you feel less alone in this game. There is probably no single greater determinant of a poker player's success than with whom he talks poker.

Well, let's say you agree with all of this&mdash;but you don't really know anyone. You've learned poker on your own, you have no poker friends who are on your level. This was the position I found myself in time and time again. The task seems daunting. How do you start? How do you make your own poker network?

The answer is simple: *give*.

Find someone whose game your respect&mdash;they might be a regular in your games, a poster on a forum, a friend of a friend, whatever. Offer them something. Share information. Reveal to them what you had in a hand and what you were thinking. Tell them some of your reads. Offer your own tips that you think they'd find helpful. Offer to help them review hands, or to let them know when good games are running. There are many things you can do, even if you're an unknown player, that another poker player will appreciate.

You might think, &ldquo;why would I do that? Just give away information&mdash;especially to someone I play against? I might as well set money on fire!&rdquo; I hear protests like this sometimes, especially when I encourage solitary students to start reaching out to other players and expand their network. And almost every time, despite sounding pragmatic, this response is usually not motivated by EV. More often, it is motivated by a fear of rejection.

Try it. Just see what happens. Allow yourself to be pleasantly surprised.

But there are times when you really don't have much to offer someone. Times when they are so much better than you&mdash;and you both know it&mdash;that you have little of value to give him. In that case: compliments go a long way.

It might sound trite, but as I was rising through the ranks, I made a number of my poker connections that way. Not flattery, mind you&mdash;it does not help to be obsequious or fawning. Most poker players, especially successful ones, find that kind of attention obnoxious. There is an art to complimenting. In the end, all poker players want to feel *respected *for their accomplishments. Most of what they are looking for is not money, but esteem. So give it to them. Find a way to make them feel like they're the kind of person they want to be.

Such is the way to a poker player's heart. Deep down, we're more emotionally driven than you'd think. If you can make someone feel good about themselves&mdash;if you are honest, forthcoming about what you want, and can humbly but genuinely communicate your respect for them&mdash;there's a good chance they'll like you, and be willing to help you out.

Reach out. Make connections. No matter how smart or capable or hard-working you are, you will never become a world-class player on your own. It takes a village to raise a poker player, but unless you were born into one, it is up to you build that village.

## Coaching and Mentorship

I remember one day, when I was an up-and-coming $10/$20 and $25/$50 regular, I tilted and played a long session against a very good nosebleeds player at $50/$100. He and I had never really talked before, but in that session he completely destroyed me. It felt like every hand he knew just what to do, how to rise above me again and again, every right call and every right fold. My game felt maddeningly futile. Eventually I was down $150K&mdash;my worst losing day ever at the time&mdash;and I quit him.

But the story doesn't end there. I sat out, but I didn't leave. I started talking to him. I told him that he was the best player that I had ever played. I told him how much I admired his game. I told him that he had just given me the worst beating of my life&mdash;and I wanted desperately to know how he did it. I asked him to teach me. And he did. He became one of my coaches, and eventually, a friend.

It doesn't matter how good you are. And it doesn't matter if, right now, things are great or terrible&mdash;finding a coach is vital to growing as a poker player.

There is only so much that you can achieve through playing, reading, or watching videos. A good coach can shine light on parts of your game that you'll never otherwise be able to see. Coaching is now so ubiquitous in poker that extolling its virtues any further would be unnecessary&mdash;if you don't have a coach by now, get one. Maybe see your coach just once a week, or once every two weeks&mdash;but see someone. Always have that eye over your shoulder. No matter how good or bad things are going, you always want a second pair of hands guiding your development.

Be thoughtful with choosing a coach. Choose someone both who is a successful player and a good teacher (i.e., is intelligent, articulate, versed in theory). Bad players never make good coaches, but good players can sometimes be bad coaches. Look for people with communication skills and teaching experience. And, just as importantly, *choose a teacher whose style you like*. If they've ever made videos, written articles about poker, or whatever, be sure to research them first and make sure you feel like a good fit. Don't be afraid to ask for a consultation beforehand, just to feel your coach out.

And once you're working with a coach, be sure to prepare before your sessions! When I was a strategy coach I taught over 100 poker players, and, consistently, the students who put in time preparing learned much more in any given session. Knowing exactly what you want to ask, which hands are giving you trouble, which aspects of poker theory you need help on, or pre-recording videos against the kind of villains who bother you is great for maximizing your value as a student. And, most importantly, grill your coach. He's there for *you*. If there's something you don't fully understand or agree with, don't be afraid to argue with him or call him out. It will not only train you to better engage in poker argument and navigate theory, but it will also keep him on point and prevent him from being sloppy. Remember, coaches make mistakes too. Keep your mind engaged, and your questions sharp.

Your relationship with coaching should not just end with hiring a coach. If you want to be a great player, I recommend that you yourself start teaching. It doesn't necessarily have to be professionally, or for money at all. But actually mentoring another poker player will teach a great deal about how to articulate theory, how to understand and mold another player's mind. It also sheds light on how your own poker mind works. A student will see your ideas and your logic with beginner's eyes. He will often, merely in the process of trying to understand you, teach you something about yourself that you never knew. Teach and be taught. The two are instrumental in developing your poker mind and keeping it sharp.

Many of the greatest lessons and &ldquo;eureka!&rdquo; moments that I had as a poker player came from teaching others. It forced me to refine my thinking, to explore and defend my thought processes in a way that I would never have had to do alone. I would say that teaching a challenging and incisive student is one of the best ways to deliberately practice your poker theory skills.

## This is Water

As a poker player, the culture of poker is all around you. Its values, its ideals, its language, its attitudes, its history. You've been swimming in it since the moment you entered this world. Whether you want it or not, poker culture is your inheritance. But it is up to you to take that inheritance and make it your own. If you are to be a professional poker player, this water will be your home. So make it yours.

When I was playing, I was a very atypical poker player. I didn't really identify with poker culture. It teemed with values and attitudes that I didn't want to accept&mdash;so I didn't. Never accept any value that you do not yourself choose. If you don't want to be ruthlessly self-interested, don't be. If you don't want to be materialistic, don't be. If you don't want to be misogynistic, or to make light of degeneracy, or to be pessimistic about the goodness of people, then don't. You are free to choose.

Poker will change you, no doubt. It changes everyone who accepts it as a part of their life**.** But you must be conscious of what you won't let it change about you.

In all of the poker culture that I've observed, if I had to choose one most valuable caution I could give an upcoming player, it would be this: don't gamble. If you go down the path of a poker player, you will be constantly surrounded by gambling. Blackjack, prop bets, sportsbetting, roulette, craps. Or gambling within poker&mdash;taking enormous shots, buying huge pieces of someone that you can't afford, entering a tournament with half your roll.

That poker players gamble in casino games has always baffled me. It is, in a sense, the antithesis of poker. Poker is a game in which we repeatedly put down our money with the knowledge that, even though this hand may be random, we will win out in the long run. Casino games are the opposite&mdash;every play whittles away at your EV. Playing casino games contradicts what it means to be a poker player.

One could argue that prop bets and sportsbetting fall into different categories, being skill and knowledge-based. While this is true, I recommend against them for an important reason. Once you start prop betting or sportsbetting, it is difficult not to let your gambling extend into other arenas. It sets a mental precedent that some gambling is okay. The brain already has enough trouble regulating itself when it wants to do something.

I have seen numerous players who started with sportsbetting or prop betting, thinking they were being strategic, and who wound up having gambling take over their lives.

As poker players, we often think ourselves immune to such a thing as a gambling addiction&mdash;we're not addicted to gambling, we're running a business, we tell ourselves. This may be true for many of us. But it is unwise to tempt that boundary. We are all merely human, and gambling is very good at sneaking up on us, desensitizing us to it, and making it a part of our lives.

But, as we all know, there are many times when gambling is necessary. Sometimes the fish wants to gamble. Sometimes everyone at the table is starting to partake in sidebets, or straddling, or whatever. In this case gambling is fine&mdash;but only within the context of being *strategic within a poker game*. As long as you obey this rule, you can keep your relationship with gambling in check.

In many cases, however, we tend to think we need to gamble more than we actually do to appease the fish, or the table, or the moment. The reality is, you can elect out of a lot more than you think you can. So long as you are sociable and confident, you would be surprised how easily you can get away with a &ldquo;no thanks, I don't gamble like that,&rdquo; or a &ldquo;no thanks, I don't like to drink when I'm playing,&rdquo; etc. If you turn things down with *confidence*, remain positive and friendly, people will respect you and want to play with you. Yes, gamble when you need to, take a drink when it's necessary, but don't surrender every decision to them.

You're a professional. Treat your life with dignity&mdash;let your body be a sanctuary to your mind. It is all you have. It is your only refuge. The better you treat it, the longer you will last in the poker world.

For the next and final article, we are going to discuss the last, but most important part in what it means to be a poker player&mdash;how to live. How can you live a good and healthy life as a poker player? How should you make sense of yourself? What should your relationship with money be? How should you deal with people outside of this world? How can you find peace? How can you be happy? I won't be able to answer all of these questions for everyone, and in some sense, what I can tell you comes less from expertise than from personal perspective&mdash;but I will offer what insight I can, and hopefully, lead you closer toward your own answers. Look forward to it.

Nobody teaches us how to be poker players.

Poker culture teaches us how to slowplay, how to setmine, how to manage our bankroll. It teaches us how to think, how to talk, what is cool and what is not. We absorb these teachings eagerly. But when was it going to teach us how to *be* poker players? What to think of ourselves? How to thrive in a culture that is built on degeneracy?

If you know the lives of many professional poker players, you know this question is not too paternalistic.

Professional poker is a strange and isolating life. Nothing you have ever done before will prepare you for it.

Over my career as a poker teacher, I have taught many things. But one thing I regret never emphasizing is the importance of living well as a poker player. This will be my attempt to rectify that, and recount everything that I think every poker player ought to live by&mdash;and what I wish I had heard when I began playing poker 7 years ago.

I will discuss many things within this series of three articles, but I will begin with: first, how to structure your poker sessions, then the art of quitting, how to pace your career, the importance of keeping poker fun, and how to avoid envy and learn to be happy for others.

We will begin with practical things we can do to maximize our performance, most of which are backed by research and studies, and some of which is based upon my experience of working with poker players. I will attempt to answer the question&mdash;how should you structure your poker sessions?

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ys2gR3Ud_iA">[video]</div>

## Structuring your Poker Lifestyle

Freedom is a double-edged sword. Your freedom as a poker player means you can live almost any way you want. The downside of that freedom is that, in the modern world, a lack of responsibilities tends to move us toward unhealthy habits. As human beings, we tend to take the path of least resistance. And in the modern world, the path of least resistance is to live an unhealthy and unstructured life.

Structure is extremely important. As adept as you may think you are at playing poker at any time of day, studies show that structure and regularity are very beneficial to learning and attaining mastery. Remember, you alone are in charge of your poker playing. You must therefore self-regulate in almost every respect. It becomes much more difficult to control tilt, marathon sessions, or other forms of bad poker judgment without a defined structure to keep you in check.

Set a daily schedule for yourself. Decide when you're going to play poker, and for how long. I recommend not playing any sessions for longer than 3 hours, and taking a short break every 90 minutes. Studies show that there is a drop in performance quality and mental acuity around the 90 minute mark; taking a break and refreshing yourself, for just 5 minutes if you can, will make you much sharper throughout the entirety of your session.

If you want to play more than 3 hours a day, break it up into multiple sessions. Put enough time between them that you don't feel like the sessions bleed into each other. I.e., resist the urge to think &ldquo;I have to get even from my first session.&rdquo; Your sessions should feel independent, and putting time between them will make that easier.

Always play at the same time everyday. Plan these times out in advance. If it is difficult for you to keep to these times, try setting timers (kitchen timers are especially effective, due to their physicality). Try not to play extraneous sessions, especially not serious ones. Train your brain to think &ldquo;this is when I play poker. Only at these times.&rdquo; Allowing yourself to play sessions at other times will circumvent much of the mental conditioning you've accrued in playing during your normal sessions. That is, you'll feel more like you can &ldquo;bend your rules&rdquo; if it doesn't feel like a &ldquo;real session.&rdquo; Thus, when you break your structure, you will be much more susceptible to tilt and bad decision making. Don't take the psychological effects of your routines lightly&mdash;they will help you immensely in controlling tilt and maintaining your level of play.

Play tough matches sometimes, but not all the time. Sometimes take it slow and just play weaker players. Whenever you are playing tough matches, do so consciously and intentionally. Focus on the game. Know what you're doing and what approach you're going to be taking, what you'll be experimenting with, what you're going to try to exploit. Focus on learning.

Always review sessions, ideally on a daily basis, with a thorough review at the end of each week. Go over hands in detail. Remind yourself what you did wrong and how to change it. Don't review your session immediately after you finish it, though&mdash;your memory is too fresh, and you'll be biased toward thinking that your reads were correct. Give some time in between; the next day is usually best.

Spread out onto as many sites as you practically can. Download every program that seems vaguely useful to you (Pokerstove? PokerEV? Tiltbuster?). Don't procrastinate on getting acquainted with any of them. Every day that you hold off on trying out a potentially helpful program, or moving onto another site, you are bleeding away money. Employ every possible tool. Search for every conceivable edge. It will only make your life and poker career easier.

Choose your rituals, and stick to them. What do you do every morning when you wake up? What do you before you start your sessions? What do you do when you take breaks? Rituals allow us to divest much of our anxiety and negative emotions. Always engage in rituals of some kind before your sessions. And by ritual I don't mean they have to be spiritual. They simply have to be consistent&mdash;choose a little routine that prepares you to play, and then stick to it.

## The Art of Quitting

A great player once told me that quitting is the most important skill that a poker player can develop. The more I came to understand the life of poker, the more I realized how right he was. Almost all poker players quit too little when they're down, and too much when they're up. It is imperative that you treat quitting as a skill, and practice it mindfully. Don't *ever* be afraid to quit when you're down.

Yes, sometimes you're ahead in EV, you believe you have an edge, this player is worse than you. We've all heard such claims a thousand times before, from others and from ourselves. They are irrelevant. The best players in the world are not afraid to quit players who they think are worse than them. The skill of quitting, in fact, is *not* in quitting people who you think are better than you. Think about it&mdash;we almost always quit once we *truly believe* that we are the worse player.

The skill in quitting comes in quitting *before* you believe that you're worse. Because in every losing match you'll ever play, it will always take a certain amount of time before you reach that point of realization. Quit early. Never kick yourself for quitting (unless you're up).

It is even okay to quit fish sometimes. Some of the players I respect most have been known to quit fish. After all, 10% of the time, the people who you think are fish are not fish at all. And 1% of the time, even if they are fish, their strategies may be exploiting you, until you realize that your assumptions about their play or psychology are mistaken. This scenario is not as uncommon as you think.

As poker players, we are constantly judging our opponents. It's in our blood; it's how we differentiate the skill levels of players and how we dissect their psychology. But this instinct works against us when it comes to quitting. When we see that the structure of someone's game is incongruous or shoddily put together, we are quick to lump them into the category of &ldquo;fish.&rdquo; And, of course, if someone is a fish, then we decide we cannot quit them no matter what.

One of the best pieces of advice I've ever received as a poker player was this one: only play when you're having fun. Doesn't matter if he's a fish, doesn't matter if you're supposed to play a session today, or if you think you have to keep playing this guy&mdash;if you're not having fun, quit. No matter your structure or how many hands you want to put in, never mentally penalize yourself for a good quit.

Poker should be played. *Play*-ed! We use the word so easily that we sap it of its native meaning, but *play* should mean what it sounds like. Poker should be fun! Not only because it makes it easier, but because it makes us perform better. Being at play, *enjoying* when you're playing not only maximizes your sensitivity to learning (as we'll discuss later), but also makes you more creative, free-flowing, ready to experiment.

Poker is a game, in the end. Even if it is your passion, even if it is your livelihood, always remember that poker is a game. That is not to say that you shouldn't take it seriously&mdash;of course, you should. But if you are not enjoying it, then you should walk away until you can find a way to enjoy it again.

## Outlasting the Mountain

Although poker can often feel like a race, it's not. It is, rather, a feat of endurance. It is more about lasting than it is about being the swiftest. So make sure you last. Take your time. Build up slowly, check your footing at every step, and treat the mountain with respect.

Be sure to take days off. Play almost everyday, but not everyday. Take at least one day a week off. Don't be afraid to take days off on important life events, or days when you're simply not up to it (and never play when you're feeling mentally unwell). Having periods of rest, giving your brain time to recuperate from the stress and mental taxation is important, not only to prevent burnout and keep your brain healthy, but to allay some of the negative effects of stress, as well as consolidate learning. In any kind of training, you must engage in *cycles* of intense performance, followed by rest. Not giving your brain rest is just as bad as working out 7 days a week&mdash;you must allow your body and mind some time to rest and recover.

Take longer breaks as needed. If things are going really poorly, you're very unmotivated about poker, or if you're going on a trip of some sort, don't be afraid to take a week or two off once in a while. These sojourns can actually be very good for resetting your perspective as a poker player, and letting you come back to your game with fresh eyes and an open mind. They can also help to reintegrate your self-narrative after a painful downswing. Just be careful to always set a date when you start playing again, so that you don't stay away from the game too long, or start dreading your return. However, if you are somebody who *continually* takes breaks (or has wider motivational problems), this is a more insidious problem to tackle. In that case, I would advise perhaps living with other poker players if you already don't (the grinding energy tends to be infectious), or working with a mental coach.

Don't spend money. Don't withdraw. Play, play, play, and be as frugal as you can while you're building up your bankroll. In the early stages of your career, your money is not yours yet. It's your bankroll, not your &ldquo;money.&rdquo; Decide on a set amount that you'll cash out every month&mdash;more than the minimum you need to live reasonably, but not too much more&mdash;and don't cash out any more than that, even if you have a big day. Decide when you'll change these monthly cashout limits (perhaps once you reach 2/4, or 3/6, or whatever). This will keep you motivated, and keep your life connected to your success, without making you anxious about poker being able to sustain your lifestyle, or having your lifestyle drain your bankroll.

Right now, as you are growing as a player, it's all about building your bankroll. Poker is the egg you're nurturing. Take care of it, polish it, keep it warm, and it will grow into a big, healthy, egg-laying chicken. But for now, it's just an egg, so keep your dick in your pants and keep things simple.

Lastly, always have a poker goal, something guiding your development. Goals are invaluable motivation. They will stoke the fire in your belly and keep you climbing. Make sure time-related goals are procedural rather than results-based. That is to say, don't make a goal like &ldquo;I want to be at 2/4 in 2 months&rdquo; or &ldquo;I want to make $10,000 in the next week.&rdquo; Any goal related to time should be about *procedure* such as &ldquo;I want to play 7,000 hands this week,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I want to obey a 3 buyin stop loss everyday for the next 2 months.&rdquo;

It's okay (and very motivating) to have a results-based goal about eventually reaching certain stakes. But never tie that goal to a period of time. Let the goal come when it comes. And don't worry; there's nothing wrong with staring at 10/20 tables and daydreaming a little. If you ask me, that's part of the fun of poker too.

## Distress and Eustress

Stress is ubiquitous in poker. Being a professional poker player will age you; make no mistake of that. But the breadth and effects of stress you experience depend on how well you are able to manage that stress, and, particularly, how you manage your downswings.

We consider downswings to be bad because, obviously, they lose us money and are deeply unpleasant. But another important reason why downswings are bad for us is because they can contribute to **chronic stress**, and trigger your long-term stress response. Chronic stress is, simply put, long-term and consistent exposure to stressors. Evolutionarily, our stress responses were supposed to be short-lived and intermittent (and usually related to food acquisition or combat). It should be no surprise then that the continual and complex stresses that poker places on us are unnatural, and we are not built to withstand it for long stretches of time.

You've probably heard about the various bad things that stress can do to your body and brain, so I'm not going to go into too much detail about the physiology of it. But the important points are that chronic stress inhibits neuronal growth, causes depressed energy levels and mental functioning, and can negatively affect your immune system&mdash;on the whole, it is very detrimental to health and mental clarity. Clearly, we want to avoid chronic stress.

But how can we? Downswings are inevitable, aren't they? Perhaps this is simply our Faustian bargain&mdash;that in exchange for the lucre of poker, we must cede our mental well-being.

It is true that with a game like poker, it is impossible to avoid stress completely. If you are being constantly challenged, molded, and affected you will undergo stress. But it turns out, not all stress is equal. There are different neurochemical pathways activated by the stress that results from *work*, and the stress that results from *play*. This latter form of stress is sometimes termed **eustress** (as opposed to distress), and is analogous to the kind of stress your body undergoes during vigorous exercise, strength training, intellectual stimulation, or sexual activity&mdash;all of which are demonstrably *good* stressors for the body.

The idea, then, is that we must transform the stress of poker from distress into eustress. If we can manage this, we can subvert many of the negative effects of stress and maintain our mental well-being. The idea of *play*, as I stressed earlier, is paramount. When you play poker, you must be *playing*!

Make poker fun, engaging, interesting, and self-interested. Whenever it is not, step away from it. Poker should motivate you. It should be fun, and satisfying! Poker should never feel like a grind, but rather like a journey, an adventure, a quest.

## How to be Happy for People

It is a statistical certainty that every single day, some fish somewhere will win a tournament. Sitting in his mother's basement, clicking buttons and playing his lucky cards, he binks more in one sitting than you make in an entire month&mdash;or an entire year.

How does that make you feel?

Perhaps this doesn't bother you. If you've played poker for a while, it probably shouldn't. So imagine instead one of the regulars at your stakes. Not the good one&mdash;no, he might almost deserve it. Think of the fishiest, scummiest, trash-talkiest nitreg you know. The guy you always want to pound on at the tables. And then imagine him binking a massive tournament for $400,000. You wake up one morning to find him at the top of the tournament leaderboards. He's donking around at $10/$20 PLO, laughing in chat and sending free money to the rail.

How about that? Steaming yet?

Or worse yet, imagine your poker nemesis. You know the one. Maybe he's the guy who rose up the stakes alongside you, always talks trash, is infuriatingly good and always knows when you're bluffing&mdash;maybe you've never spoken to him, but in your mind you two are eternal competitors. Or perhaps, your closest friend, the one with whom you have competed side-by-side, the one who sets all of the milestones by which you measure your progress&mdash;what if it's *him* who binks that big tournament? What if he gets catapulted to high stakes, leaving you behind to grind out your .5/1 or 2/4 by yourself?

If there's one inevitability in this poker, it's that things will be unfair. Great players will sometimes fail, and bad players will sometimes succeed. This is an inevitability. But how can we *embrace* this fact? Intellectually, it becomes easy to accept after a while. But the challenge is in accepting it with *grace*&mdash;and eventually, with happiness for other people's fortune.

We naturally have two emotional responses to other people's success&mdash;envy and self-consciousness. Envy, because we want what they have. When they gain respect, fortune, or fame because we already desire those things for ourselves, we naturally resent them. But they also make us feel self-conscious, because their fortune separates them from us. Once your nemesis becomes rolled for high stakes, he is no longer a member of your caste. He has risen above you. It leaves you wondering&mdash;why not you? Were you not as good as him? Not as smart? Not as deserving? In the end, this reaction has more to do with negativity toward ourselves than toward others.

But the one thing we all have in common is our desire to be free from these emotions. No one *wants* to feel bad when others succeed. We want to be indifferent, or happy for them. But how do we get there?

Survey yourself. When someone else succeeds and you feel negatively towards it, where does that negativity come from? Analyze your emotions as clearly as you can. Then find and espouse a mental frame that diminishes that response.

For example, here is a very powerful mental frame: &ldquo;I am climbing my own mountain of poker. My challenge is dealing with what happens to me; what happens to anyone else is irrelevant.&rdquo; If you'll remember, this is similar to the fog of variance frame discussed in an earlier chapter. It reinforces the idea that other people's fortune is independent from your own. You must imagine your mountain is already set in stone, as are others'&mdash;but that needn't bother you, anymore than it should bother you that someone else at a table was dealt AA. People will get dealt AA. You know they will. But all you can do is focus on playing whatever you were dealt as well as you can.

Try being happy for people. Even people you don't like. It's hard, and we are inundated with stories of other people succeeding, while poker constantly tries to convince us: &ldquo;why not you?&rdquo; But you suspect&mdash;rightfully so&mdash;that your life as a poker player will be better when you can be genuinely happy for others. This point extends to bad beats, too.

Stop telling bad beat stories. The desire to complain to others about your bad beats derives from a nearby artery&mdash;wanting affirmation that your failures are not your fault, and that you deserve more than what you have. Sharing bad beat stories makes you pay inordinate attention to hands where you lose unjustly. Just by repeatedly re-living those spots, you reinforce negativity, and the belief that all of your losses are unjust.

Make a rule for yourself that you're no longer allowed to tell bad beat stories, but instead, are only allowed to show other people hands where *you* suck out. Remind yourself of how fortunate you are. Reinforce the belief&mdash;I am lucky to get the breaks I *do* get. Things could always be worse. This will not only make you a more positive and better poker player (and improve your well-being outside of poker), but focusing on your good fortune is bound to make you a better person on the whole.

Practice being happy for others. Tell a friend good job on his winning month. Write someone who won a tournament a private message, applauding him. Maybe, if you want a challenge, write that regular you dislike, the one who outstripped you and is now a higher stakes player, and congratulate him on a success. Do little things. Make sure they hurt a little, kick up your bitterness, or make you a little sick to your stomach. Lean into your envy. This is the only way to extinguish it.

Eventually, it won't bother you anymore. You'll learn to be more relaxed about other people, and with yourself. You will find great relief in being happy for others.

We concluded the first part of this article series with a discussion on structuring your poker life and career. But being a poker player is about more than merely playing poker&mdash;it is also in how you conduct your life around it.

It is no secret that poker is an unwieldy horse. It is stubborn, unpredictable, and will happily buck anyone who can't hold on. Most can't. You likely know someone who couldn't, and was trampled underneath the weight of poker.

I know many.

I want you to hold on. But it isn't easy. It requires attentiveness, hard work, and living well. It requires honoring your life and your health. In part two of this article series, we will discuss the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle as a poker player, including practical advice on sleep, nutrition, and exercise. We will then go on to discuss motivation, and the role that need and ego play in the development of a poker player.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MfQxYZvfYxQ">[video]</div>

## A Healthy Constitution

Poker is a demanding existence. It drains us. It muddies our sleep, health, and diet. Many poker players have trouble balancing their lives; some never do. One of the greatest challenges to you as a poker player is to restore that balance. Not only for the sake of your game, but for the sake of your overall well-being.

The bedrock of your constitution comes from diet and nutrition. Even if the other pieces are missing&mdash;if you're sleeping poorly or not exercising&mdash;learning healthy eating habits is perhaps the most valuable thing you can do to immediately improve your well-being.

Stop eating processed foods. Throw them out completely. Cut out as much sugar as you can. Ideally, limit your diet to fruits, vegetables, nuts, meat, and unrefined grains (if you're ambitious, you may want to try cutting out grains entirely). Eat multiple meals a day&mdash;4 or 5 is ideal, but if you're not already, at least 3 meals a day is a good start. Eat to satiety, not fullness. When shopping, stay on the periphery of the supermarket&mdash;almost everything in the aisles is processed, or otherwise bad for you. Eat real food, as close to fresh and from the farm as you can. Take a multivitamin and fish oil to supplement any nutritional deficiencies. Eat slowly. Savor your food. Be consistent in your meals. Cook if you can, or hire a personal chef if you can afford it. Pre-made meals are also a reasonable option. Don't eat fast food, even when you're feeling lazy. Be consistent, push through for a while, and you'll build up habits that will sustain you.

Cut out sodas and soft-drinks completely&mdash;they are essentially liquid candy. Energy drinks are especially sugary and come loaded with dangerous amounts of caffeine, so avoid them. Caffeine itself is a tolerable vice, so if you must have caffeine, ingest it from tea or coffee (Google &ldquo;bulletproof coffee&rdquo; for a healthy and delicious coffee recipe). Drink as little alcohol as possible (and always lock yourself out of your poker accounts when you plan to drink). If you must consume alcohol, give preference to wine (especially red), light beers, and wood-aged spirits (whiskey, brandy, scotch, cognac).

Eating multiple, smaller meals a day, consisting of foods that have lower glycemic loads (that is, foods that don't have as much sugar and don't spike your insulin levels as strongly) will make your blood sugar more consistent throughout the day. More consistency means that you won't have the ups and downs of sluggishness and depression that often comes from a poor diet. You will feel more rounded and energetic throughout the day.

## The Power of Exercise

In a lifestyle as sedentary and chaotic as poker, regular exercise can feel like it's difficult to maintain. But the benefits of exercise are numerous and powerful&mdash;it's truly one of the most valuable investments you can make in your life.

Regular vigorous exercise triggers rushes of endorphins (which not only make us feel good, but also increase our mental clarity and stimulate learning). It also helps to keep our energy levels stable throughout the day. It's been proven time and time again that exercise is the *most effective* treatment for depression (individually more effective than either antidepressants or therapy), and this has a dose response, meaning the more exercise you do, the more improvement to your overall affect. Plus, this is not to mention that it dramatically increases your life span, your immune system, makes you look better, burns fat, and allows you to eat more (who doesn't love eating?). Exercise is as close to a panacea as it gets.

If you're not exercising at all, start. Find something easy and doable. It may be something like powerwalking, a small regimen of pushups and situps, jogging, even some mild yoga. For poker players who travel often, it is important to remember that you can get in very intense body-weight workouts *anywhere*. There are no excuses. When I was traveling through Europe, I would often do my workouts in a hotel room, out in a park, or on a secluded street corner.

A word of advice: don't just get a gym membership and think you've got it taken care of. Statistically, paying for a gym membership in and of itself doesn't make it very likely you'll actually go consistently, or get in good workouts. Instead, sign up for exercise classes, hire a personal trainer, or find a motivated workout buddy to train with you. The latter three, because they involve *structure* and *social pressure*, make it much more likely that you will end up exercising and being consistent with your workouts. They will also make your average workout intensity much higher.

It may help to emphasize skill development rather than just &ldquo;working out.&rdquo; Focus on building strength, or improving your yoga/flexibility, or improving your kickboxing skills. The more motivating and goal-oriented you are, the easier it will be to exercise continually. It goes back to as we discussed in an earlier chapter&mdash;co-opt your environment. Assume your unconscious self will generally take the path of least resistance, so stack the odds in favor of exercising. It will pay off in the end.

And lastly, don't fear overtraining. The odds of overtraining for someone who's just beginning or has an intermediate workout regimen is so low as to be negligible. Workout as much and often as you possibly can&mdash;it will hurt at first, and be cumbersome. But eventually, you will mentally associate it with the feeling of efficacy and the proceeding endorphin rush that comes after a good workout. Eventually, you'll start to like it (I promise). It takes time to get over the initial hump, but the fruits of good exercise are invaluable for your body and mind.

## Sleep and Sleep Cycles

Finally, we come to sleep. Sleep is one of the most notoriously chaotic elements in a poker player's life. The poker player who goes to bed at sunrise and wakes up at 3PM has become almost a cliché. But sleep is essential to not only physical recovery and health, but it is *vital* to the consolidation of learning and memories. Sleep is when your brain is reorganizing itself, processing everything it's learned from the previous day, and replenishing its energy stores. Getting good and adequate sleep, therefore, is essential to learning poker.

Studies show that aligning with your natural Circadian rhythms (being awake during times of light and sleeping during dark) minimizes fatigue. Your body has been acclimated over hundreds of thousands of years to be awake during the day and asleep at night, so inverting that rhythm is suboptimal for your mental and physical functioning. For some, inverted sleep may be unavoidable, especially those who play live poker.

But for the rest of us who have more freedom over where and when we can play, we should try to adjust our sleep to be awake during the day and asleep at night. Being aligned with the cycle of sunlight will increase your energy levels, your overall health, and perhaps just as importantly, will keep you more connected to the rest of the waking world. Being a citizen of the night is very isolating, and is probably one of the reasons why depression is so rampant among poker players. An inverted sleep cycle disconnects you from the rest of the world.

Be wary of your **sleep hygiene**. Sleep hygiene is the term psychologists use to describe healthy, consistent sleeping habits. The basis of good sleep hygiene is going to sleep at the same time every night, and making sure you get continuous 7-9 hours of sleep every night. In fact, studies show that the most important element of sleep hygiene is sleeping *at a consistent time*. Inconsistent sleep is far worse for your body and mental functioning than inverted sleep. So treat your sleep as sacred, and take extra lengths to try to sleep at the same time (or close to it) every day.

Other important elements of sleep hygiene are simple recommendations: don't eat heavy meals before sleeping, avoid any stimulants such as caffeine or nicotine, and avoid alcohol. Don't do anything in your bed except sleep and have sex&mdash;no reading, laptop use, or TV watching. Associate your bed solely with sleep, and it will become easier for you to fall asleep.

A good way to structure good sleep habits is by having a pre-sleep ritual. Brushing your teeth, changing into pajamas, reading before bed, or whatever you do&mdash;having pre-established rituals that signal your body and mind to get ready for sleep will ease the nighttime transition, and relax you so that falling asleep becomes easier.

But as poker players, our sleep hygiene is constantly assailed by the vagaries of poker. Most commonly, sleep patterns tend to be disrupted by big downswing days, or after marathon sessions. It is vital that you don't allow this to happen. Letting bad poker days affect your sleep will only magnify the loss' effects, and make it that much harder to mentally and emotionally recover the next day. If it is time to sleep and you have just quit a losing session, or are still stewing over one, you must first find a way to relax yourself. If the loss still stings, practice some relaxation techniques, take a warm bath, call a friend, watch funny Youtube clips&mdash;whatever will calm you down so that you can sleep properly. Writing about the session immediately afterward may help to divest you of the feelings and thoughts you're experiencing, so you can leave them behind when you go to sleep.

Remember, when you get up from a bad session, you have not absolved yourself of responsibility. A challenge still remains from the moment you leave the table&mdash;the challenge of resuming your normal day-to-day habits with minimal disruption. If you want to live well as a poker player, you must strive to live well *in spite* of poker. Being able to get a good night's sleep after a bad day, eat a good breakfast in the morning and have a vigorous workout is in and of itself a victory. Your normal routine in and of itself will abate much of the negativity that usually settles after a bad downswing. Think of your lifestyle as your frame&mdash;the frame of &ldquo;despite this, my life moves forward.&rdquo; Fight for that frame. Your lifestyle is the vehicle which will carry you forward.

If it needs fixing, fix it now. Move your sleep slowly toward nighttime. Start cutting out bad foods, little by little. Go on a jog, or sign up for a jiu jitsu class. Fortify yourself step-by-step, and always feel like you're moving forward. Take care to nourish your body and mind, and they will excel and be of great use to you.

## Need and Ego

It always struck me as a curiosity that the vast majority of world-class poker players came from the same place&mdash;they are almost all mostly young, college-educated Western males from comfortable middle-class backgrounds. Of course, you can attribute a lot of this to cultural factors. College is where middle-class, analytically-minded boys have a lot of free time (and poker is marketed primarily towards males), so that explains some of it. But it doesn't explain this: why don't more great players come out of poverty? Why aren't global poker sites inundated with grinders from China, or India, or other parts of the developing world where people *really need* the money? To be a bit cynical, it seems all of the money in poker mostly goes to the people who don't really need it.

What is it that these Western kids are playing for, then? It's hard to encapsulate it in a word. Perhaps ego. Competition. Validation. Fighting for a dream, or a fantasy. Although you might say that such motivations are minor, somehow they seem to be stronger and more sustaining motivations than need.

In fact, studies in behavioral economics have demonstrated the adverse effects of monetary motivation on creative performance. To put it simply, the more you have physically at stake, the further creative performance plummets. But once you find intrinsic motivations&mdash;e.g., ego, competition, self-mastery&mdash;your performance at a creative task becomes more steady and robust.

Comparing poker to a video game is a common trope, but it may have a great deal of insight to it. Imagine if you had to play a video game, but every time you lost a life, you lost money. Do you think you'd play better or worse? The pressure would most likely not only make you play worse, but stress you out and lessen your enjoyment of the game. Poker is very much the same way. Those who feel that poker is a safe haven, a playground, an arcade game on their computer&mdash;they are most free to be creative, to explore, to *play*. They are able to learn and experiment uninhibitedly. And, as is common knowledge now, intrinsic motivations tend to be stronger and more sustaining than extrinsic ones. It is more powerful to want to attain mastery at something, or to prove something to yourself, than to want to reach an arbitrary monetary amount or achieve some kind of external goalpost.

This, again, bespeaks the importance of having the right kind of motivation. Embrace a goal of self-mastery, or becoming better than your competition. Don't play because you need to. Play because you *want* to.

## The Obsession

Most poker player's relationship with the game begins out of obsession. If you have never spent hours tinkering with excel sheets, PokerStove, your HEM stats, railing the $25/$50 games immersed in a personal fantasy, then you will probably never be a great player. Every great player I have ever known has started with this obsession.

The obsession is not always a healthy one. It usually isn't. For many, it digs into them, and handful at a time, scoops out the pulp of their life. Before long, through fantasies, through reading forums and poker books, through breakfasts contemplating how to balance their turn overbetting ranges, poker possesses them. It enters them like a ghost, a parasite. And it rallies every resource they have toward poker.

No one else will tell you this, but I will tell you the truth: if you do not have this&mdash;if you have never been taken over, if this mania has not hijacked your mind&mdash;then you should give up on poker. You should walk away now. You will never be a great player. Chances are, you will only lose money and time. You are liable to only hurt yourself and those around you.

This is the truth. If you are not a little bit crazy, you will never reach the level of excellence and dedication required to master poker.

But let's say you do. Let's say you wake up in the middle of the night from dreams of hands you you'd played the day before. Let's say you fantasize, calculate, strategize, obsess. Then perhaps poker is for you. Perhaps that fire will propel you. Dive into further into its depths. Once you do, poker itself will be the easy part. Even when it's not easy, it will be easy.

That is where the real work begins&mdash;in taming the obsession. When you are developing as a player, poker is constantly pumping through your veins, like a drug, a poison. But after a while, perhaps years, or however long it takes you to reach a place of maturity, or security&mdash;after that, you must be ready to retake control of your life. For most poker players, it takes them a long time to take back the reins. Some never do at all.

This retaking is essential. It is the basis upon which we as professional poker players can find peace, happiness, flourishing. There comes a point in the life of every burgeoning professional at which you must steal back your life and make it your own. Perhaps you are at that point now.

In the next article, we will conclude our examination of the life of a poker player. We will look into the importance of spiritual health, happiness, balance in life, and resolving your identity as a poker player. These three articles will comprise the final chapter in my book, and so the next article will also be the final one.

In the first two parts of this article, I gave much advice on structuring your poker career, and the proper roles of health, ego, and obsession. But what I have not yet discussed are the spiritual and philosophical aspects of life as a poker player.

How should we live our lives *away* from poker? What relationship should we have with the game? How can we become happy, and still be poker players?

I cannot promise that what I have to say will fully answer these questions for you. Only time and repeated failures will provide you with those answers. But I can promise that what I have to say will stimulate your thoughts, and hopefully, spur you toward finding your own answers.

Let us move forward, from the health of the body to the health of the mind.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QpFjuC7JrAo">[video]</div>

## Spiritual Health

The basis of a good life is balance. Not just balance in physical health, but in mental and spiritual as well.

Do not neglect your spiritual needs. And by spiritual needs, I don't mean religious needs&mdash;though if you are religious, then religion can be a powerful source of spiritual nourishment. But for those who are not religious, there are still many paths to spiritual health.

Meditation has been practiced in various forms for thousands of years. Studies show that regular meditation has profound effects on the brain. It can increase pain tolerance, improve resilience to stressors, and is correlated with an increased sense of well-being. There are many different types of meditation that you can incorporate into your life&mdash;zazen, vipassana, qigong, mindfulness, to name only a few. If you've never meditated before, the [UCLA Mindful Awareness Research Center is a good place to start](http://marc.ucla.edu/body.cfm?id=22).

But, if you are a poker player, meditation alone is unlikely to sustain you. As poker players, we are deeply engaged in the world, and so detachment alone cannot solve all of our problems. We must face the world and our desires head on. Thus, the greater part of our spiritual fulfillment must derive from our **self-actualization**. Basically, self-actualization comes from aligning the *self-we-are* with the *self-we-want-to-be*.

The ancient Greek poet Pindar once wrote, &ldquo;Be what you know you are.&rdquo; This is, to my mind, the best encapsulation of self-actualization. Decide what kind of person you want to be, and then move, thoughtfully and actively, toward that ideal self. When humans are aligned with this trajectory, they experience a sense of well-being. Self-actualization makes you feel like you're on the right path. It becomes easy to love yourself, and to honor the process of your life. When humans are misaligned with this trajectory, they often feel lost, as though they are squandering their lives. As a poker player, you have the freedom to pursue self-actualization in a way that most human beings on this planet don't.

Think about the kind of person you want to be. Not just in poker, but in all things. Visualize that person. Write what you see. Fix it in your mind. What is that person like? What do they do? How do they see themselves?

In whatever way you are unlike that person, in whatever way your ideal self outshines you, move toward it. If you are too pessimistic, try to be more optimistic. If your ideal self can do something you can't, start learning that skill. If your ideal self is in better shape, or is better-read, or knows another language&mdash;follow it! Become! Inch toward who you really want to be, and don't let a week go by in which you don't make any progress.

Learn new things. Improve your abilities. Become stronger, kinder, wiser. These are nourishment for the spirit. And it is your spirit, above all else, that will sustain you in poker.

## The Journey of Poker

A poker player must be a realist.

In the past, we've discussed with great optimism the importance of diligence, being healthy, and taking poker seriously. But it would be delusional to claim that following these precepts means you will necessarily succeed. While it is essential that any poker player become a rigorous student of the game, the fact remains that these things alone, no matter how thorough, are not a golden ticket.

Poker makes no promises.

Perhaps you will not be smart enough. Mentally tough enough. Maybe you won't have enough time, or energy, or money to brave the torrents of variance that poker will unleash on you. Perhaps&mdash;dare I say it&mdash;you will simply get unlucky. Poker is ultimately a gamble from start to finish. We don't get to choose our success. We can supplicate, make libations, practice prudence, but in the end it is the poker gods who choose whether we will prosper.

Part of the journey of poker is its uncertainty. We must live with that. But at the same time, we must take full responsibility for who we are and our success as poker players. There is no excuse not to take up every arm we can, not to scour for every shortcut, not to attempt every unexpected checkraise and slow-play that crosses our path. Though we are at the mercy of the poker gods, we must nevertheless struggle, push uphill, and keep our heads up. This uncertainty is also what it means to be a poker player. It is the journey we all have chosen.

The great imperative, as Nietzsche put it, is to love your fate&mdash;*amor fati*. Choose every moment that comes upon you as if you had invented it yourself. Embrace every failure, every success, every downswing and upswing, every hero call and failed read as your own. That's not to say that they are all your fault&mdash;but you must take them all as unquestionably yours. Don't seek justice. There is no such thing in poker. There is only fate&mdash;so you must seek your fate.

Accept everything that comes. This is the only philosophy that survives in poker. Usher in your fate with open arms. If you must suffer, suffer gladly, hoist it up like a flag. Love whatever happens. It is all a part of your journey.

To paraphrase Bruce Lee&mdash;do not hope for an easy life. Rather, hope for the strength to endure a difficult one.

## The Importance of Being Happy

In American culture, we are fond of telling people to &ldquo;find happiness.&rdquo; The phraseology suggests that this is a relatively straightforward task. Supposedly, there exists a thing somewhere called happiness, and we just need to find it. It may take a lot of looking around, we may have to fulfill certain obligations first, collect a certain amount of money, or join a certain social class&mdash;but once we jump through those hoops, it will be there, waiting for us.

Unfortunately, happiness is not just hard to find; it is impossible to find. Happiness is not found, but rather *constituted*. Let me explain what I mean.

There is a well-known factoid that 90% of lottery jackpot winners lose their fortune within 5 years or less. Much of this can be attributed to the fact that lottery winners, like the rest of us, are stupid. But there is a less well-known factotags: [in longitudinal studies of happiness, people who won the lottery had no sustained changes in their happiness level after one year. That is to say, their elevated levels of happiness and life satisfaction from winning the lottery very soon dropped completely back to normal.

Perhaps you find this surprising, perhaps you don't. But the opposite effect is even more surprising. Happiness studies of people who become significantly physically disabled, the same effect can be found&mdash;happiness levels drop, but return to normal within about a year. People permanently confined to wheelchairs, after a year, are just about as happy as they were before being disabled.

This seems perverse to us. It seems to brush off some of the most basic human metanarratives we have&mdash;the idea that if we work hard, our lives will be better, and if our lives are better, we'll be happier.

Time and time again, the evidence insists: happiness cannot be found.

Much of these effects can be attributed to what psychologists call **habituation**. Habituation is the psychological process by which we adapt to a constant stimulus by filtering it out. An obvious example of habituation is wearing clothes&mdash;as soon as you put your pants on in the morning, you feel them on your body, how they fit, their texture and warmth. But right now, as you examine yourself, you likely have no awareness of your clothes at all. It's almost as though your body has incorporated your clothes as part of you, and stopped registering them as foreign. The stimuli are being filtered out.

Habituation is essential for any complex organism. If we did not habituate, then we would constantly be overloaded with sensory information, so much so that it would impair our ability to direct our attention strategically. From an evolutionary perspective, things that are important tend to move (people, predators, prey). Thus, we evolved to filter out things that are stable and unchanging.

Incidents like winning a large amount of money, or being permanently confined in a wheelchair&mdash;these are all situations that, once they occur, are unchanging. Once you have a lot of money, you just have a lot of money. Once you're in a wheelchair, you're just in a wheelchair. Your brain starts filtering it out. It becomes the normal, and your brain doesn't pay attention to the normal (it's too busy worrying if a saber-toothed tiger is going to jump out of that rustling bush).

Although it runs counter to many of the narratives we've been taught, neither having a lot of money nor becoming physically disabled has a significant effect on happiness. So what does? The most inclusive answer would be: your disposition.

This is what I mean when I say that happiness is constituted. We do not *find* happiness, but we create it out of the ingredients of our lives *as they are*. People who are happy tend to be happy because of their disposition to see the world and themselves that way. Likewise for people who are unhappy. Our happiness levels tend to be fairly resilient&mdash;they usually stay around the same level for most people's lives.

But there are a few things we *can* say about how to be happy. Happiness studies reveal a few unsurprising results&mdash;couples are happier than single people, religion makes people happier, and optimists are happier than pessimists. People of means tend to be happier than poor people, but studies show rather robustly that income above $75,000 has no effect on happiness levels. That is, income has a moderate correlation with happiness until 75K, at which point the money really stops making a difference (perhaps because past that point, anxiety about money becomes trivial).

Experiences tend to make us more happy than material goods, and so you should aim to spend your money on experiences, rather than stuff. This is in no small part because it is very easy to habituate to material objects, but new experiences are, by their nature, impervious to habituation.

We can extend this insight to other aspects of our lives. How do we become more happy? One answer is to try to resist habituating to the good parts of life. Find ways to continually remind yourself of how fortunate you are, or how good you have it, or how awesome it was that you accomplished a goal. Savor and mentally relive your good experiences. Some psychologists suggest that you write a gratitude journal every morning, naming 5 different things that you're grateful for. Another strategy is to go without something you like for a while, and then reintroduce it. To some extent, we *can* learn how to be more optimistic and appreciative of the world around us.

Studies also show that being happy bolsters our ability to perform. The science of learning demonstrates that people learn and retain new information best when they are feeling good, and creative performance significantly improves while experiencing positive affect (contrary to the idea of the &ldquo;tortured artist&rdquo;). It increases your life span, your resilience, it makes you more likeable. One is almost inclined to say that being happy will keep you happy.

And yet, the question of how to *become* happy remains a tricky question. Many cultures have offered their own answers to this question, and there is no answer that will fit everyone. But for my own part, on the question of happiness I look to the transcendentalists. To them, the question &ldquo;how do I become happy?&rdquo; is in itself the wrong one to ask. Rather, one should lead a good life, better oneself continually, and be good to others. Happiness, to my mind, not the *purpose* of a good life, but rather, one of its consequences.

In the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson: &ldquo;The purpose of life is not to be happy. It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some difference that you have lived and lived well.&rdquo;

I try to live by those words. But if they do not suffice for you, don't worry; you are not alone. It simply means you must keep on searching.

## Staring out the Window

In the end, if you are to be a professional poker player, then poker will be the chief focus of your waking life. Things will be that way for a while. But you must not derive your sense of self from poker. You must remember that you are more than your poker playing self.

I stress this, in no small part, because I failed at this when I was a poker player. And I believe now that this was largely what made me unhappy throughout my career. After enough time, I could not sever my larger identity from my identity as a poker player. I forgot who I was&mdash;I lost myself to the game.

Do not lose yourself. You are *you*. Explore every side of yourself. Even while you are studying poker and invested in this journey, you must not forget who you are, and what you are worth in the absence of poker. Find balance.

And when I say find balance, I mean&mdash;integrate yourself in the world! Keep in touch with your friends outside of poker. Always be learning new skills, reading and learning about the world, making new friends and challenging your sense of reality. We all start being consumed by poker, but you must not remain consumed by it.

You will not play poker forever; none of us will. So don't bury all of your seeds in this plot. Once you have a sizeable bankroll, I would advise you to cash out half of your bankroll and invest it, then treat it as though it's off-limits. Have a backup plan in case things go wrong (either on your end, or by some catastrophic incident). Have some sense of what you are going to do after your poker career is over. Think about it seriously. It's an important question. Even if you love poker, to be a consummate professional, you must be thoughtful about all of the possibilities.

Please, don't be cynical about poker. It's easy to be. It's easy to say that poker is a useless game, to treat it with contempt, to see it as a mere money-making machine. Poker can be those things, of course. It can be whatever you want it to be.

But don't do yourself that injustice. It's a waste. Poker, if you treat it with respect, can be a rite of passage for the rest of your life. It can be an arena for practicing self-mastery. Poker can teach you patience, fortitude, thoughtfulness, strength. It doesn't have to be meaningless. It shouldn't be! Let poker challenge you, let it raise you up. Let it make of you a greater human being than you were when you came to it. It can do all of those things if you treat this game, and yourself, with dignity.

Be careful. Don't let poker make you jaded or negative. Don't let yourself lose connection with the rest of the world. Don't forget the poor, the unlucky, the self-sacrificing. Don't forget art. Don't forget books. Don't forget working with your hands. Don't forget helping people. Don't forget sunrises, or mountains, or taking walks on winter mornings. Please, remain connected to the world. Poker may be around for a long time, but you won't. Don't let your time slip away.

One last thing. If you ever find yourself, on a lazy Sunday afternoon, staring out the window at a tree, at a bird, at the blue sky… whatever you do, don't think about poker.

I wish you the best of luck. I mean it. I really do.

It's fall now, and just starting to get cold in Texas. I haven't written in a while.

The book, The Philosophy of Poker, I will collate and edit from the pieces written on this blog. I'll release it within the next couple of months as an e-book. There will be extensive editing, some additional material I've thought of in the interim while writing the book, and some revisions of ideas that I've changed my mind about. On the whole, if you want to have all of the work in one easy-to-read format, or something you can read on an e-book reader, you will be pleased with the final result. If there is enough demand, I may consider doing audio recordings of the chapters.

But that's all forthcoming. What about now? What comes next?

> The truth will set you free. But not until it is finished with you.

Those of you who follow me on my blog must have noticed an obvious trend in these blog entries. I have been pontificating about poker and psychology and whatnot. But I haven't talked about myself at all over the past year.

I've always been bad at that. I'm a better listener than a speaker. Perhaps that's one of the reasons that I fell into poker so naturally&mdash;poker is all about listening, observing, and deciphering the person in front of you. It is more about seeing than saying.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kFaypkwEXh4">[video]</div>

It should have been a tough year for me. From having [Jason Burt steal 90k from me and disappear](http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/showpost.php?p=38315814&postcount=1), to learning in the 11<sup>th</sup> hour, after FTP remissions began, that my former [Red Pro status barred me for receiving my locked up balance](http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/showpost.php?p=40184543&postcount=108), to other financial hiccups&mdash;I've run about as bad as a retired poker player can run.

But that's okay. It's hard to be mad. Anger doesn't come naturally to me. And ultimately, I'm okay. I'm not going to starve, and I have my health. I am grateful for that. Perhaps this is all deserved, and the way it should be&mdash;some kind of cosmic equalization. No doubt, I have a lot of bad karma to work off still.

It's been two years now. Two years, and still, the Girah affair is fresh in my mind. How stupid is that? Two whole years. Even now, I have dreams about it. I wake up feeling like I'm in the middle of it again. When I see stories about public scandals, my stomach retracts into a pit. I can't even read them without feeling sick. It's as though the guilt is lodged somewhere deep in my intestines, or branded into my DNA. Whenever I think about the scandal itself, about everything that I did, it just crushes me.

To tell you the truth, I've believed ever since then that I am a bad person. For two years now, since I returned to the States, I've been living as simply as I can and doing volunteer work almost every week&mdash;construction work with Habitat for Humanity, and now, teaching English to refugees for iACT. I've tried my best to be kind, to be selfless, to give myself away. Really, I've been desperate. For what, I don't know. Absolution? Salvation? Assurance that I am not wretched? I don't know what would be enough.

I get nods from strangers, smiles, little stories about how I've helped. I am told to come back next week, and the week after that. Things haven't changed.

What comes next? In spite of everything, life smears itself forward.

I'm not sure where I'm going next. I've given thought to many roads. Going to law school; pursuing a PhD; entering finance; going west and joining the world of entrepreneurs. I don't know yet for sure, but I'll likely know&mdash;or have to&mdash;after the next six months.

Right now, I have to focus on right now. I need to edit this book, focus on my work, keep looking forward. I have to trust the process. The answers to the questions&mdash;what comes next, and how to like it&mdash;I will have to do without for the moment.

title: Beauty in Poker
tags: [poker]

I had been thinking some about the aesthetics of poker lately, and someone reminded me of an article I wrote in 2009, back when I was 19. I've decided to reprise it here with a little editing; it didn't need that much, to my surprise. It's one of the pieces I wrote about poker that I'm really proud of, so I wanted to have it here as well. I hope you guys enjoy it.

Pablo Picasso once said, &ldquo;Beauty?… To me it is a word without sense, because I do not know where its meaning comes from nor where it leads to.&rdquo; Beauty is a difficult word to define, and it seems to have no single definitive characteristic. There can be beauty in a flower, beauty in a waterfall, beauty in a woman. But there are other forms of beauty that are less basic to our perception. We can find beauty in the movement of dance, in the richness of music, the rhythm of poetry. And yet we can go further, to beauty that departs from these conventional senses of the word. We can find beauty in mathematical proofs, beauty in the handling of a basketball, beauty in a chess stratagem, and indeed, beauty in a hand of poker.

I have always been an artistically-minded person. Not because I am myself an artist, but because I have always been drawn toward art. So this question had a special resonance to me: in what sense can a hand of poker be beautiful?.

It certainly isn't beautiful in any purely aesthetic sense (that is, in its appeal to our senses). A hand of poker will never be sensually stimulating, and in that way, it is more like the beauty of a mathematical derivation than the beauty of a painting. In order to understand what makes a hand of poker beautiful, we must first decide how we ought to appropriate the concept. There must be some experience in common between observing a beautiful hand of poker and anything else that is beautiful. What is it like to experience a beautiful hand of poker?.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f19NA6bqiTA">[video]</div>#### Looking to the Source

To discover if beauty existed in poker, I looked to the source, poker players. I picked a few high stakes players I knew and interviewed them. I carefully chose players who I thought were particularly reflective and intelligent, and I tried to phrase my questions carefully so as to extract as much of their own thoughts as possible, without biasing them toward mine. Although I won't name the poker players I interviewed, they were very established high stakes regulars.

![Ace of Spades (Langford Style) by Malkav, on Flickr](http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2307/2389757333_96867b5dcf.jpg)

What I found was that there was a surprising unanimity among them on not only that there *was* beauty in poker, but also on what constituted that beauty. For all three players I interviewed, I began in the same way&mdash;&rdquo;can you name some hand or event in the context of poker that you would describe as beautiful?&rdquo; Each of them provided one hand that they felt fit this criterion. I then probed their reasoning about why they thought the particular hand was beautiful, and what made poker hands beautiful in general.

The first person told me, &ldquo;I think anytime I make a &ldquo;perfect bet,&rdquo; as in one with a certain timing or amount to make my opponent do exactly what I want, that's beautiful.&rdquo; The second person described a beautiful poker hand as &ldquo;manipulating [one's] opponents in an artistic way.&rdquo; The third person described beauty in poker as &ldquo;finding an eloquent, unexpected solution.&rdquo; The language was slightly different among the three players, but when I questioned them further, I found that they could be distilled to the same essential component&mdash;mastery.

Mastery is beautiful. It's making perfect bets, making your opponent do exactly what you want. It's manipulating your opponent in an artistic way. It's finding that eloquent, unexpected solution. Mastery is beautiful, and so we must explore what mastery is to explore what is beautiful within poker.

#### What is Mastery?

If you imagine the world from an undifferentiated, &ldquo;objective&rdquo; perspective, there is no such thing as mastery. This is true on various levels, such as saying &ldquo;everything is just particles mashing about chaotically&rdquo; or &ldquo;if an alien came to earth and watched humans playing a game of basketball, they would see nothing but animals romping around with a ball,&rdquo; and of course there are infinitely many variations on this theme. The notion of mastery collapses once you deconstruct some element of the cultural frame surrounding that task. Mastery does not exist objectively; it exists only once you set parameters on what experiences are meaningful, and what goals ought to be pursued by human endeavors.

The philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre aptly separates the human sphere thus: the widest sphere, the entire human community, recognizes a limited number of forms of mastery. These are mostly limited to the basic virtues: moral goodness, industriousness, courage, etc. It is only when we narrow our scope to looking within what he calls a &ldquo;practice,&rdquo; that the more variegated and interesting goals of human effort become meaningful (he calls these &ldquo;internal goods&rdquo;&mdash;goals that are meaningful within a certain practice, but not outside it). A practice is any subsection of humanity in which people are pursuing a more specific set of goals than those pursued by the larger human community. Practices can be simply understood as crafts or professions, like carpentry, or basketball, or cardplaying.

So in order to understand mastery in poker, we have to realize that outside of the practice of poker, there is no meaning or intrinsic value in the mastery of poker, and hence it could not possibly translate into beauty. One must first acknowledge poker as a worthwhile practice, and *understand* poker well enough to recognize mastery. If there is beauty in poker, it is entrenched behind these two layers, which the average person will not be able to cut through. In the same way, I may be told that a mathematical proof is beautiful, but even though I have some rudimentary understanding, and even reverence, of mathematics, I don't have anywhere near the understanding of the practice to recognize mastery, and hence beauty. Show me two potential proofs of the Poincaré conjecture, and setting aside which proof is beautiful and which isn't, I wouldn't even be able to tell which one were a proof and which were garbled nonsense.

So if there is beauty in poker, then this beauty can only exist within the practice, and can only be recognized among those who have sufficient understanding of the practice. You might even go so far as to say that within every practice that is sufficiently complex and understood, there exists some form of beauty (hence, it shouldn't puzzle you to hear a CEO talk about a beautiful negotiation, or a boxer talk about a beautiful punch, or even a scammer talk about a beautiful scam). So we should have no apprehensions with talking about beauty in poker so long as we understand how we are constraining the set of people who can experience this beauty.

So, that being said, what constitutes mastery? The dictionary will tell you that mastery is &ldquo;the possession of consummate skill.&rdquo; This is easy enough to understand, but it falls short of providing a useful picture. If you think about mastery in terms of poker, it seems as though mastery can be roughly defined as the ability to make the most +EV set of actions (given, of course, imperfect information). So to recognize mastery, we must be able to recognize what is the most +EV action to take at any point in time&mdash;we must know what &ldquo;the right play&rdquo; is. If you have no idea what the right play is while looking at all possible options, then you will not be able to perceive mastery, and hence the beauty of a hand will escape you.

Now, this definition actually gets a little tricky here, because defining mastery as simply &ldquo;making the right play,&rdquo; seems to be overly inclusive. For example, folding 39o preflop UTG in a full ring game is absolutely the right play each and every time. And yet, if we had the hole card cam on Phil Ivey folding 39o UTG, this would not strike us beautiful. The notion of mastery would not even enter our thoughts. We have to then infer that there are some things which are optimal (&ldquo;the right play&rdquo;), but which are not beautiful.

How is this line drawn? How are some things which are optimal beautiful, and others trivial? Our reaction is to look for the purely aesthetic element&mdash;e.g., in basketball, a dunk is more visually impressive than inbounding a ball, so that's why a great dunk will be more beautiful than a great inbound pass. But I don't think that this is enough. I think a better way to understand this problem is to think about the difference between structure and &ldquo;gameplay.&rdquo; (I choose the word *gameplay* because the analogies that I'm using here are games like chess, basketball, and poker, but this still applies to a practice which is not a game, such as mathematics or carpentry or whatever..

#### Structure and Gameplay

In all of human experience, there is a basic duality that defines our interaction with the world. That duality is the opposition between the conscious and the unconscious, foreground and background, substructure and superstructure. All of experience is predicated upon this fundamental, yet almost invisible distinction. In any experience of the external world, your unconscious filters out what is unimportant, otherwise it would be impossible for your brain to extract patterns from such enormous swathes of information (all of the visual, aural, and tactile stimulation that your nerves are recording at every moment of your life). If you are exposed to any stimulus long enough, it congeals into a background entity, swept behind the curtain of your consciousness, and ceases to be an object of direct perception. This is obvious with things like putting on pants or wearing sunglasses&mdash;at first, it is an object of experience, but as it the experience is repeated (the feeling of having your leg press against denim or seeing an object shaded darker than it usually is), your brain filters it out and you no longer notice it. In a way, this is what happens in games like poker as well.

This initially manifests in understanding the basic structure of the game. When two players get to showdown and turn up their cards, if you had no idea how poker was played, looking at their hands would be completely meaningless to you. You wouldn't know the structure of the game&mdash;you wouldn't know the rules. How would you decide who won? Of course, poker has a complicated set of rules about how to combine two cards together to create different hands, some of which beat others. This is the structure of the game on the simplest level. Once you understand how to evaluate showdowns, then this is subsumed into your understanding of the structure of the game. At that point, you understand the basic rules. You can't break those rules. You can't take the pot if you have a straight and your opponent has a flush; the structure of the game determines that the person who has the flush will win no matter what.

But the structure of the game goes further than that. The structure is simply what is constant to your perception&mdash;there's no reason why it has to be limited to the most explicit rules. Once you have learned basic preflop hand requirements, then you know that raising 39o UTG is definitely a bad play, so you fold it every time. In fact, everybody else folds 39o UTG as well. When you fold 39o UTG, you no longer have to mentally consult a preflop raising chart to see whether that falls into the range of hands you can play around with&mdash;it's simply an auto-fold. Folding 39o preflop becomes a mental constant, you stop perceiving it or thinking about it as a decision in your poker game. Folding 39o effectively becomes a rule of the game. You can't break this rule, in the same way that you can't take the pot if you have a straight against a flush. It is incorporated into the structure of the game.

![Gambling Addiction by schnappischnap, on Flickr](http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5342/8969117237_3ca6fa687e.jpg)

So structure becomes more and more developed as one moves closer to mastery of any practice. In poker, many things start to become relegated to structure, such as continuation betting, raising the river with the nuts, 3-betting AK preflop, etc. If anything is obviously the correct play and is constantly repeated, it eventually becomes incorporated into structure and ceases to be a point of gameplay. Gameplay, then, can be defined as that which is not constant&mdash;whatever we need to think about, what's dynamic in any instance of the game that we play. In a 10/20 6-max round, nobody is ever going to raise 39o UTG; that is simply not a part of gameplay, which is effectively the same as saying that it's an illegal move. However, 3-betting an UTG raiser with 67s *is* a legal move. People know that this is a viable play, but not a mandatory one. Hence, 3-betting an UTG raiser with 67s counts as gameplay.

The conclusion is that mastery will only be appreciated if it occurs within the *gameplay*, not within the *structure*. Anybody who follows the structure of a game has, in a sense, some basic level of mastery. Neither an amateur nor a professional basketball player will try to travel to the other side of the court without dribbling the basketball, and so both the amateur and professional are obeying the structure of the game, but we don't find this to be indicative of mastery. It simply means that if they don't do this, then they haven't outright broken the rules yet. True mastery is demonstrated through gameplay.

#### Delineating Structure

To properly separate structure from gameplay, you must first understand the structure that a master is working within. If an amateur were to watch a professional chess match, he might marvel at the thoughtfulness displayed in the first four or five opening moves. But for masters of chess, gameplay doesn't begin until their respective &ldquo;opening lines&rdquo; begin to interact. The first few opening moves are all structure, because they are determined by each player before the match began, or directly determined by the other player's opening. They're not dynamic.

Structure in high level poker is quite similar. When amateur poker players observe a high level match, very often what they tend to do is ascribe elements of gameplay to what is actually structure. When railbirds (or poor commentators) see a preflop 3-bet or a flop check/raise, they tend to say things like, &ldquo;Oh, he's fighting back!&rdquo; Or if they see somebody call a jam with a hand like 99, they might say something like &ldquo;He's taking a stand, he won't be pushed around!&rdquo; In reality, the gameplay in a high level match is occurring on the battlefield of frequencies&mdash;the individual hands usually are of token importance. Individual flop checkraises and preflop 3-bets compose the structure of the match, and the adjustments and frequencies that each player adopts are what constitute the actual gameplay. This is invisible to those not privy to how high stakes matches are played, which makes it impossible for an amateur to really understand the dynamics of such a match.

But in spite of the fact that little gameplay occurs within individual hands, there nevertheless seem to be some hands which can be described as genuinely beautiful. How is this possible, if gameplay is taking place within the interplay of ranges and large-scale adjustments? Beautiful hands are rare, no doubt. But once in a while, we do see a hand that seizes our awe.

I think what defines beauty in poker is not just gameplay within structure, but gameplay that challenges structure. Structure, remember, are the constraints we perceive upon the field of gameplay. But there are times when inspiration strikes a player to see beyond structure, and to harness some tool or technique that seems to be structurally disallowed. These are the moments that we see as beautiful&mdash;the beauty is in the breaking of the rules that we realize were never really rules. It's to capture that eloquent, unexpected solution.

#### An Eloquent Unexpected Solution

When I conducted those interviews with the high stakes players, it was around the time that the QT hand that Durrrr played on High Stakes Poker had just aired. It caused quite a stir among poker aficionados, and two of the players I interviewed actually mentioned it as an example of a beautiful hand of poker. Here it is.

Eastgate and Durrrr are 500k deep, and Barry is 200k deep. The blinds are 400/800 with a 200 ante, and Barry Greenstein opens under the gun for 2500 with AA. Durrrr who is immediately to his left calls with QTs, six other players behind him call, including Peter Eastgate in the small blind with 42s. The flop comes down 22T. Peter checks, and Barry leads out the flop for 10k. Durrrr makes it 37k, Peter overcalls, and Barry calls as well. The turn comes down an 8 and they both check to Durrrr, who bets 104k. Peter Eastgate folds quickly, and Barry folds after some thinking.

The vast majority of people who commentated on this hand had a poor understanding of what was actually going on. When Barry's bet comes around to Durrrr, the standard play is going to be to fold (Barry is betting here into 8 players, so he almost certainly has something after raising UTG). The way that full ring players are conditioned to react to a spot where there are 8 players in the pot and UTG bets into them is to realize that a lot of strength is being represented here by this action, and so they fold all but the strongest of hands. The structure of the action (the positions, board texture, and amount of players in the pot) are supposed to create a situation where Durrrr has to play straightforwardly. This is the structure of this situation. But instead of obeying this structure, he goes the other way&mdash;he exploits the the fact that he has a ten, which blocks the most likely nuts (TT), and he decides to strong-arm the structure of the hand and use it to his advantage. When UTG+1 raises the UTG player with 7 players left to act in a pot with 9 players on a board where UTG obviously has something, it represents enormous strength and an indifference as to what action occurs behind.

When he makes the raise, Peter Eastgate overcalls from the small blind, and Barry calls as well, and the turn comes down a blank. Durrrr bets the turn a big size&mdash;one that seems to signal to Eastgate that he's looking to get all-in, and one that has Barry completely covered. Once Peter Eastgate overcalls the flop, it's very obvious that his range includes some 2's, TT, and 22. The structure has become *again* intensified, because all players in the hand know that every other player acknowledges this structure, and so when Durrrr bets the turn big even when he knows what is meant by Eastgate's overcall, Eastgate's decision must acknowledge this fact. He knows that Durrrr is not stupid, and so he's going to play his hand value relative to what is dictated by the structure of the hand and everybody's perceived ranges. Now, of course if Eastgate had had 22, Durrrr would have not looked as spectacular, but it was a risk that he took, and I suspect he was not going to beat himself up over it if Eastgate turned out to have had quads.

It wasn't just the fearlessness that Durrrr demonstrated or the fact that he bluffed for such an enormous pot, or even that he bluffed Eastgate off of trips and Barry off of aces up. What's beautiful about the hand is how Durrrr managed to find an eloquent solution that challenged the basic structure of how the hand was supposed to be played.

#### Ascending the Ladder

Now, I won't get carried away here. I won't say that this bluff that Durrrr made was a sudden spark of creativity or some kind of eureka moment that broke full ring poker wide open. The bluff itself is actually fairly basic, and I'm sure Durrrr makes these kinds of bluffs with some regularity when the opportunity presents itself. If you wanted to, you could just call it something as simple as balance (i.e., since Durrrr is bluffing here so rarely, he has to include the occasional bluff, and if you look at the situation holistically QT is the best hand to do it with). High caliber full ring players make this kind of bluff all the time I'm sure&mdash;if they didn't, then it'd be far too easy to play in these situations, and they'd be missing out on too much bluffing EV since they usually get credit for having hands. The hand is beautiful because it demonstrates mastery, as Durrrr certainly understood everything that was going on (he basically called both of their hands when the hand was over), and its defiance of structure. But in spite of that, there are many other hands like it that could be summoned, which moves it closer and closer to being structurally sound (something like &ldquo;standard&rdquo;).

Ultimately, the higher and higher you go on the ladder of poker prowess, the more difficult it is to find hands that an expert player will consider beautiful. If a hand is demonstrative of mastery, then the highest caliber poker players understand the inherent concepts and employ them whenever they can in their games. If you asked somebody like Durrrr or LarsLuzak for an example of a beautiful hand, they'd have much more difficulty producing an example than a mid to low level player would. This is because of all of the possibilities that are available in poker, players like Durrrr and Lars have explored so many of them and can see every inch of gameplay that is possible (that is, they are not obstructed by false structure), and so there is very little that appears to them as genuinely novel or beautiful. The situation would either have to be very rare for it to seem beautiful (because it would come about so rarely, they could appreciate the moment of discovering a solution), or it would have to manifest itself not in a hand, but in the higher level gameplay of adjustments and counter-adjustments..

Poker is all about possibilities, and the moment of discovering a new possibility is the sweetest feeling for a poker player. For a beginner, you might imagine that they'd find the most mundane of poker dogma, such as folding ace-ten offsuit from under the gun, as a beautiful solution to a difficult problem. And as we move up the ladder, players start to appreciate more subtle and surprising solutions to various problems, slowly uncovering more and more of the field of gameplay. Even experienced players often speak of &ldquo;aha&rdquo; moments, at which point their understanding of poker suddenly jumped up to another level, or some concept which they once didn't really grasp was suddenly elucidated. I think these are the moments in poker we all hunger for. There is, truly, no greater delight than that moment of discovery. When we emerge out of the cave of ignorance, and the light of realization blinds us with its brilliance… it is then that the universe of possibilities unfurls itself before us. And indeed, it is a thing of beauty.

<nav class="inline">[#](#num) [A](#a) [B](#b) [C](#c) [D](#d) [E](#e) [F](#f) [G](#g) [H](#h) [I](#i) [J](#j) [K](#k) [L](#l) [M](#m) [N](#n) [O](#o) [P](#p) [Q](#q) [R](#r) [S](#s) [T](#t) [U](#u) [V](#v) [W](#w) [X](#x) [Y](#y) [Z](#z)</nav>#### #

- <span class="term">$1/$2, $5/$10, $10/$20</span> A way of notating the size of the blinds in the stakes being played. $10/$20 means a $10 small blind, and a $20 big blind. In this book, it generally refers to no-limit stakes, so a normal buyin for a $10/$20 game is 100 big blinds, or $2000.
- <span class="term">3-bet</span> To reraise; a raise over a raise. (The initial bet on any street is a 1-bet, the raise a 2-bet, but those terms are not used. Preflop, the big blind is considered the initial bet, so the first raise is a 2-bet.)
- <span class="term">4-bet</span> To reraise a reraise; to raise a 3-bet.

#### A

- <span class="term">Air</span> Cards that completely missed the board; a nothing hand.

#### B

- <span class="term">Backdoor</span> To hit a hand using the turn and river cards, and only one or no flop cards. Generally considered to be a sneaky (or lucky) hand to hit. Synonymous with &ldquo;runner runner.&rdquo;
- <span class="term">Bad Beat</span> To initially have a stronger hand than your opponent, but have your opponent get lucky and improve his hand, causing you to lose.
- <span class="term">Balance</span> Having different kinds of hands (such as strong and weak) in your range to &ldquo;balance&rdquo; it out.
- <span class="term">Baller</span> Slang for someone with a lot of money, or someone very successful. Derives from footballer or basketballer.
- <span class="term">Bankroll</span> The amount of money you have allocated for playing poker. Also known as your &ldquo;roll.&rdquo;
- <span class="term">Barrel</span> To bet continually postflop.
- <span class="term">Bb (big blind)</span> The minimum possible bet in a no-limit or pot-limit game. Also refers to the player at the table who's in the position of having to pay the big blind preflop (considered the worst position at the table).
- <span class="term">Betting Pattern</span> The sequence of bets that a player makes during a hand, or habits that a player has in how he bets certain hands. A player with a transparent betting pattern will implicitly reveal how strong he is during a hand.
- <span class="term">Bink</span> To get lucky and hit something.
- <span class="term">Blank</span> A card that doesn't change the board significantly. Usually a low card, but not always.
- <span class="term">Bluffcatcher</span> A hand that is strong enough to beat a bluff, but is not itself a strong hand. If the preflop raiser bet every street on A♣K<span class="red">♦</span>9<span class="red">♥</span> T<span class="red">♥</span>2♠, and you called him down with K<span class="red">♦</span>Q<span class="red">♥</span>, that would be a bluffcatcher.
- <span class="term">Board</span> The totality of the community cards. We say the board &ldquo;changes&rdquo; if the addition of a new community card dramatically affects hand values.
- <span class="term">Board Texture</span> The way the arrangement of community cards interact with each other. A board like 9♣4<span class="red">♥</span>2♠ would be a considered to have a &ldquo;dry&rdquo; texture, because the cards don't really interact with each other, and there are few draws or strong hands that connect with it. On the other hand, a board like J♠ 9♠ 8<span class="red">♥</span>would have a very &ldquo;drawy&rdquo; texture.
- <span class="term">Bumhunter</span> Someone who only waits around for very fishy players, and refuses to play anyone else. Generally a pejorative in poker culture.
- <span class="term">Button</span> The person with the dealer chip. This is the last player before the blinds, and the player with the best position.
- <span class="term">Buyin</span> The amount of money one brings initially to the table. It's also used as a measure of big blinds&mdash;one buyin is considered 100 big blinds, since that's the standard buyin for a no-limit game. (You can technically buy in for many different amounts though. In most games, there is a cap on how much you can buy in for, which varies depending on the structure and size of the game.)

#### C

- <span class="term">C-bet (continuation bet)</span> To follow up a preflop raise with a bet on the flop, regardless of how the board connects with one's hand. It's called a continuation bet because it's essentially a &ldquo;continuation&rdquo; of earlier aggression, exploiting the power of taking initiative.

- <span class="term">Checkraise</span> To first check, and then raise over a bet.
- <span class="term">Cold 4-Bet</span> To make your first raise be a 4-bet over someone's 3-bet. Basically, if some other player raises, and someone else reraises him, and you reraise that person as your very first bet, that's called a cold 4-bet.
- <span class="term">Connect</span> For a hand to interact positively with the board in some way. Your hand connects with the board usually if you've made a pair or a draw.

#### D

- <span class="term">Deepstacked</span> Playing with generally 200 big blinds or more at a table.
- <span class="term">Donk</span> Donk can be either a noun or a verb: as a noun, it's slang for a donkey, or a bad player. As a verb, to donk can mean to lead out into the preflop raiser before he gets a chance to bet, or in a phrase such as &ldquo;donk around,&rdquo; it can mean to act stupidly.
- <span class="term">Donkey</span> A bad or stupid player. Pejorative.
- <span class="term">Downswing</span> An extended losing streak.
- <span class="term">Draw</span> A draw (or drawing hand) is a hand that is not yet complete, and needs another card in order to become a strong hand. Four cards of one suit (drawing to a flush) and four consecutive cards (drawing to a straight) are the most common.
- <span class="term">Drawy</span> A drawy board is one on which drawing hands are likely, or with which many good starting hands will connect with draws. J♠ 9♠ 8<span class="red">♥</span>is an example of a board with a very drawy texture.
- <span class="term">Dry</span> A dry board is a disconnected, unsuited board, with which most starting hands won't connect or make draws. A board like 9♣4<span class="red">♥</span>2♠ is an example of a dry board.

#### E

- <span class="term">Early Street</span> The earlier betting rounds in a poker hand. This typically refers to preflop and the flop.

- <span class="term">EV</span> Expected value; this refers to how much money you should win or lose *on average* for a given decision. EV is a statistical concept&mdash;in a sense, it's what you &ldquo;should be making&rdquo; for any given play.
- <span class="term">Exploitation</span> Taking advantage of weaknesses in an opponent's game. For example, if someone is bluffing too much, you can exploit them by calling more bluffcatchers; if someone is bluffing too little, you can exploit them by never bluffcatching.

#### F

- <span class="term">Flatcall</span> To call.
- <span class="term">Flatting</span> Also means to call. Short for flatcalling.

We all come to poker with a blank slate. No one arrives knowing how to identify a SA/WB, read a flop texture, or spot a cooler. We learn these things through the feedback that poker provides us. And yet, though poker gives us all essentially the same feedback, some of us become proficient and others do not. One of the strongest determinants of how good a player will become is in how they respond to that feedback.

How do we become masterful in poker? How do our responses and attitudes toward feedback determine our skill level? And what can we ultimately do to better orient ourselves toward feedback?

In this final article on learning, we'll be delving into the science of mastery, how to position ourselves so that we respond as optimally as possible to feedback, how to avoid loss aversion and other pitfalls in self-conditioning, the power of self-talk, and we'll discuss some tips on how to maximize our efficiency as learners.

In previous chapters, we have skirted around the concept of mastery, but let's now face it head on. As poker players, this is ultimately the one goal we all have in common: mastery of our craft.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uOR8t1UVJ4c">[video]</div>

## The Science of Mastery

The definition of **mastery** can be elusive, since it's subjective what we consider masterful. After all, to a 5¢/10¢ player, any $1/$2 regular might seem masterful, whereas to Phil Ivey, perhaps *no one* seems masterful. The exclusivity of &ldquo;mastery&rdquo; depends on your vantage point.

But for simplicity, we'll accept some ambiguity in our definition. We'll say that mastery is &ldquo;reaching the highest level of proficiency in an art.&rdquo; So a master could be a concert pianist, a chess grandmaster, a professional athlete, or, for poker, a consistent mid-high stakes regular.

The science of mastery was famously explicated by Malcolm Gladwell in his book *Outliers*, which was largely based on the research of Swedish psychologist Anders Ericsson. According to this research, achieving mastery is the result of a supportive environment and continual, consistent effort, rather than due to innate skill or natural &ldquo;genius&rdquo;. More contemporary studies have posited two key elements to acquiring mastery: 10,000 hours of deliberate practice, and a capable mentor. (We will focus on the first element in this article; we will discuss mentorship in a later article.)

10,000 hours is an intimidating number. If we take this number literally, for someone who's been playing poker for five years, playing 360 days a year, in order to have reached 10,000 hours, they'd need to have played about 6 hours a day, every day. If you've been playing poker for eight years, that number adjusts to about 3½ hours a day. These numbers might seem daunting&mdash;but it's important to remember that there are different levels of success in poker (you can be a top $2/$4 regular, or a losing $10/$20 regular). Furthermore, studies have shown that the 10,000 hours rule famously touted by Gladwell isn't so clear-cut&mdash;depending on the field, that number may range from 8,000 to 25,000 hours. For poker, chances are, it's on the lower end, since it's a relatively young game, and many masters of poker have been playing less than ten years (whereas the best concert pianists have been training all their lives). So you should take this to mean not so much that there's a magic number of hours that you need to play, but more simply that you just need to play *a lot* to get to the highest arena of the game.

So, the dictum goes, &ldquo;10,000 hours of **deliberate practice**.&rdquo; What is deliberate practice? Ericsson theorized that it is not enough to merely perform a skill a large number of times; *how* you practice is the key to whether you will ever attain mastery. Here are some of the essential properties of good deliberate practice:

1. Breaking down skills into smaller chunks, and rehearsing those specific skill chunks
2. Continually practicing the skill at more and more challenging levels
3. Being very conscious and attendant toward feedback and mistakes, with the intention toward mastery

What makes practice &ldquo;deliberate&rdquo; becomes very clear&mdash;rigorous effort with the intention to dissect a skill and master every part of it.

This is all well and good for mastering a piano sonata, but what about poker? In poker there's no such thing as &ldquo;practising&rdquo;&mdash;you can only *perform* it (since play money is nothing like the actual thing). A concert pianist can practise his piece a hundred times before a recital at Carnegie Hall, but it's impossible for a player to practise taking a shot at Jungleman unless he actually *plays* Jungleman. Or is it?

This problem troubled me for a long time. What does practice mean in a game that is all performance? Is poker some kind of exception from the conventional concept of mastery? After pondering this problem for some time, I eventually came to the conclusion that although poker has some particular nuances of its own, the same rules that apply to other forms of mastery hold true for poker.

Poker has some counterparts to deliberate practice, like studying or [watching videos](http://https://haseebq.com/learning-how-to-learn-the-three-types-of-learning-and-the-three-fold-path-2/). Ultimately, however, they are not enough. The only thing that qualifies as true, deliberate practice is *deliberate play*. Play *is* practice in poker. Every session in which you are paying your full attention to your errors and trying to learn from them, in which you are actively trying to train a particular weakness, e.g., to take more risks, play more conservatively, or learning to play deepstacked&mdash;when, that is, you are listening as closely as possible to**what poker is telling you&mdash;*this* is deliberate practice.

Thus, it is not enough to have done 10,000 hours of mindless grinding or 24-tabling. It *must* be deliberate. You *must* be listening to feedback from poker, and using it to inform changes in your game. In order for each session you play to count towards your goal, it must be a conscious, intelligent, and measured attempt to improve and monitor your weaknesses. There are only two types of players who are ever able to quickly shoot up through the stakes&mdash;those who put in many hours in a short time, or those who are profoundly rigorous with their playing and studying habits. This is the only viable path to mastery&mdash;genius alone always falls short.

## Orienting Yourself Toward Feedback

We've already discussed things like isolation drills and elaborative rehearsals, which can help make our practice more deliberate, but on the whole, practicing poker is trickier than practising most other things. If you are practising a piano sonata, by playing the piece through, you can usually hear whether or not you've misplayed a note, but as a poker player, you don't always know when you've made a mistake. Poker is constantly giving us feedback, but that feedback is noisy, chaotic. This is partly why poker is such a difficult game to learn.

Feedback causes mental conditioning&mdash;positive feedback will reinforce a behavior, while negative feedback will discourage it. Imagine your brain as a little mouse in a cage, which is either fed little pellets, or shocked by electricity. Usually, you get fed pellets for being good, and zapped for being bad. But in poker, both pellets and shocks sometimes come down randomly. It can sometimes seem like there's no rhyme or reason&mdash;pellet, shock, pellet, shock, shock, pellet. With all of this chaos, your little mouse is bound to get confused, and come up with all sorts of strange and outlandish explanations of why pellets and shocks appear (which, unsurprisingly, is exactly what novice poker players do&mdash;when I was playing NL10, after losing a few big pots to 25o and 34o, I used to believe that playing low cards was smart, because no one would ever guess when I'd hit two pair or trips).

This is the basis of being **results-oriented**. Somebody who is results-oriented will respond to the surface-level feedback that poker is giving him. For example, if he makes a bluff that fails, he will often get discouraged and assume that it's bad. Being results-oriented means that you're conditioned by what poker does in *this* instant&mdash;whether it shocks you or feeds you a pellet*.* But poker is capricious and as experienced and thoughtful players, we ought to know this. So instead of letting poker shock or feed our brains, *we* must take hold of the lever, don our labcoats, and become the scientist feeding or zapping our mouse brains.

We want to be **process-oriented**. Instead of focusing on results and winning every hand, we focus instead on going through the right decision making process, on making plays that will be good *in the long run*. This gives us the ability to make plays that may lose in one instance, without becoming negatively conditioned against making that play again. *It gives us control over our own conditioning*. Being process-oriented allows us to circumvent some of the stochasticity and chaos of poker, and more directly shape our brains toward an ideal game.

That's all well and good, you might say. But how do I *become* process-oriented? How do I stop feeling bad when I lose an individual hand? There are two answers to this problem&mdash;the first is that it gets easier with time. Lose enough hands and you'll become desensitized to losing, eventually no longer feeling the negative conditioning that often comes with it. But the second answer is a bit more complicated&mdash;and that brings us back to the realm of cognitive biases.

## Loss Aversion and Other Feedback Imbalances

**Loss aversion bias** is the observation that people are inherently irrational in risk-taking&mdash;they overvalue averting losses, and undervalue making new gains. For example, if you're in a 300bb pot, and you have 200bb behind with which to bluff shove the river, and you think that he's folding 50% of the time&mdash;would you shove, or would you fold? Even with these assumptions, many people check back this river because their mind is inherently biasing them toward keeping what money they have. The 200bb they already own have feels *more valuable* than the 300bb in the middle. Another way of saying this is that losing 200bb feels worse than winning the 300bb in the middle feels good.

In reality, every dollar should be equal to every other dollar (in most cases). A dollar gained should be equally as good as a dollar lost is bad.

This bias is one of the most difficult to overcome, because, ultimately, emotion plays a huge role in how we make internal decisions in poker&mdash;not simply in terms of strategy, but also in terms of how we play, when we play, and who we play. To combat this bias and become more process-oriented, perhaps your most valuable tool is self-talk.

**Self-talk** is the process of mentally &ldquo;talking to yourself&rdquo; while you're doing something. It's a ubiquitous feature of our mental lives, as we are constantly praising, reminding, and chastising ourselves as we act in the world. There are three basic types of self-talk: positive, negative, and instructional. Positive self-talk is self-reinforcing, such as &ldquo;I've got this in the bag,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I'm so sick!&rdquo; Negative self-talk is self-rebuking, such as &ldquo;god, I'm such a donk,&rdquo; or &ldquo;how could I make that call?&rdquo; Instructional self-talk, on the other hand, is a mental reminder or walk-through on how to execute something, such as &ldquo;okay, call this turn and then shove any blank river,&rdquo; or &ldquo;don't tilt, stay calm, and wait for him to 3-bet you again.&rdquo;

It's unsurprising that positive self-talk is vastly better for performance than negative self-talk. But, interestingly, studies have shown that instructional self-talk actually produces better performance than positive self-talk. Thus, it is in your interest to mentally talk to yourself and, essentially, to coach yourself through your poker game in your mind (that's not to say that positive self-talk doesn't serve an important function, as we'll discuss later). But it's instructional self-talk that best remedies the problem of loss aversion bias.

Instructional self-talk can help our rational mental processes overcome and influence the biases of our unconscious mind. If you tell yourself &ldquo;it's okay I lost two buyins, because I had a good shot at three buyins, and that was hugely +EV,&rdquo; by saying this to yourself enough times *you will learn to accept this as a satisfactory justification. *By repeatedly instructing yourself and tempering your natural loss aversion with self-talk, you can counteract the natural impulse of your mind to inhibit whatever behavior led to that loss. You can do the same thing to counter other cognitive biases, such as first-impression bias (your tendency to cling to first impressions longer than you should). Self-talk is an invaluable tool for a poker player, one that needs to be developed right alongside any other.

As the loss aversion bias demonstrates, quite often our brains do not interpret different kinds of feedback with equal weight. I call these **feedback imbalances**. Because of feedback imbalances, our brains provide their own additional layer of noise over and above the distortion inherent to poker.

Consider **negative events**. A negative event is when you decide *not* to do something you were considering doing. Negative events happen all the time&mdash;you elect not to 4-bet, or decide against a flop checkraise. The problem with negative events in poker is that we rarely allow them to strongly condition us.

Say, for example, you're in a big pot, you've barrelled two streets, and you're deciding whether or not to bluff the river. If you barrel the river and he folds, you win the pot, you feel really good, and get a big chunk of positive conditioning. If you bluff the river and he calls your bluff, you lose, and you get a big chunk of negative conditioning. But what if, after some consideration, you *don't* bluff the river, you lose, and he shows the nuts? You might feel a little sense of relief, but probably you'll feel relatively neutral, and perhaps even a little irked that he had the nuts and won the pot. There is a feedback imbalance here&mdash;when you make the right decision by barrelling and he folds, you get a lot of psychological reinforcement that it was a good play. But when you make the right decision by checking and he wins with the nuts, you get very little reinforcement that you made the right play. The latter doesn't *feel *like a win, when strategically it is.

Another prominent feedback imbalance is in hero calls. Think about the last time you made a hero call with ace high in a big pot. If you were right, you probably felt amazing&mdash;heroic, even, as the term suggests. You got an enormous surge of positive feedback when you called, a surge that was repeated every time you showed that call to a friend. But what happens when you call with ace high and lose? Well, some of the time you might feel really stupid, especially if you get berated. But most of the time, you'll probably just think to yourself: &ldquo;well, I knew I was beating his bluffs, and he happened to have it this time. I still don't know if it was a good call.&rdquo; Or, if he had a bluff that beat you, you might think to yourself, &ldquo;damn! I knew he was bluffing! So sick!&rdquo;

This might not ring true for you, but it does for many players. Hero calls carry a lot of psychological baggage, because we tend to glorify them in a way that we don't other poker hands. It's almost as if they're exempt from the normal rules of poker diligence. As a result, failed hero calls tend to get relatively little negative feedback, while successful hero calls get overwhelmingly positive feedback. In terms of the emotional calculus, you can see that your brain *incentivizes *you to make outrageous hero calls. After all, it doesn't feel that bad when you lose, and it feels amazing when you win. Hence, hero calls introduce a troublesome feedback imbalance.

So what can we do to equalize feedback imbalances? The answer comes back again to self-talk. Using positive self-talk, you can reinforce behaviors and plays that on its own, poker does a poor job of reinforcing. For example, after checking the river in a big pot and not firing a final barrel, once he shows down the nuts, instead of simply allowing yourself to feel bad or neutral that he won that medium-large pot, you might instead mentally tell yourself, &ldquo;Good job not firing that river bluff. He would've called. Good play.&rdquo; With hero calls, you can do a couple of things to equalize the feedback. First, you can engage in negative self-talk (followed by instructional self-talk) to make a failed hero call more likely not to get brushed over by your brain: &ldquo;damn, I shouldn't have made that call. Bad play. Be more careful with hero calls.&rdquo; Second, you could try to dampen the positive reinforcement by successful hero calls to make things more even. For example, you could make a rule for yourself that you're not allowed to show off your hero calls to any of your friends. This would remove a large part of the psycho-social incentive to making the hero call to begin with, and make you more likely to simply focus on making the best play in a vacuum.

Related to the idea of a feedback imbalance is the concept of **indicative strength**. Indicative strength is, simply put, how much information a certain fact (a hand he shows, or a play he makes) gives about your opponent's game. I'll illustrate with a non-poker example, for simplicity.

Say you have a jar of marbles. You can't see inside it, but you know that there are 100 marbles, and there are only two possible overall configurations: there are either 95 red and 5 blue, or 65 red and 35 blue. You don't know which of these configurations it is, nor the probability of each configuration, but you are allowed to draw out one marble. So let's say you draw out a marble and it's red&mdash;this is an event of low indicative strength. That is, it doesn't tell you much about whether the jar is 95% red or 65% red. It could easily be either. But if you draw out a first marble and it's blue, this is has very high indicative strength&mdash;it makes it *more *likely that it's the 35% blue configuration..

Using marbles, this concept might seem self-evident. But in poker, the confluence of emotions, noise, and complexity make it much harder to properly attribute probabilities. For example, in a spot where you call top pair because you think your opponent has either the nuts or a missed draw, in the event that he shows you the nuts, you generally accept a *large* chunk of negative conditioning&mdash;&ldquo;god, I'm such a donk, I should've folded.&rdquo; Quite often, his showing down the nuts is an event of low indicative strength&mdash;he would have the nuts sometimes whether you thought he was bluffing with his draws or not, and so you shouldn't be very strongly conditioned by it. But when your unconscious mind loses a big pot (because it naturally wants to find significance in everything), it doesn't account for that. It simply sees a hand you lose to, and rings the hurt bell.

Our unconscious minds tend to be very poor at processing data for its indicative strength, and so we must use our conscious minds to calibrate our reactions (and thereby, our self-conditioning). Self-talk, again, is a powerful remedy. By telling ourselves: &ldquo;I knew he might have the nuts either way; that doesn't tell me anything about whether my play was good,&rdquo; we mollify some of the negative conditioning that comes with losing that pot.

We must always be vigilant with our conscious minds, and learn to orchestrate the dialogues in our heads. Eventually, with enough practice, your unconscious mind will learn to interpret such events in a way such that you no longer need to consciously regulate it (that is, attributing indicative strength will reach a level of unconscious competence). But until then, you must be rigorous with your mental dialogue to calibrate your own self-conditioning. Self-talk is one of the few things over which you have genuine control in poker, and so you must wield and master it as best you can.

## The Pitfalls of Hand Histories

There are some pitfalls in learning that are more deeply entrenched, and often, more difficult to see. One such pitfall is what's known in psychology as **context-dependent memory**. This is the phenomenon by which something that is learned in one context is much better retained, retrieved, and reinforced within the same context. So in short, if you want to retrieve a memory, you should put yourself in the same context you learned it (e.g., go to the same place, engage the same senses, put yourself in the same physical state). This might seem obvious, but it has one very important implication to the learning of poker.

If your first thought was &ldquo;hand histories,&rdquo; you're right on the money. Hand histories are, in a very important sense, *alien* to the context in which we actually play poker. Think about it. A hand history is a big, meticulous, awkward block of text. It has no sense of time, it (usually) has no visual cues at all, and it is static, while an actual poker hand involves movement and action&mdash;the way you experience a hand history is completely**different from the way you actually experience the living hand of poker. The effect of this is that learning you gain from a hand history (or books or forums) is not going to be fluidly exported when actually playing poker.

This partially explains the existence of players who offer robust analysis on hands, but who are much weaker at actually playing poker. There's various names for this phenomenon: &ldquo;theory crafters&rdquo; and &ldquo;keyboard jockeys,&rdquo; among others&mdash;these people have learned most of their poker skills in the context of hand histories, perhaps by reading lots of forums or watching videos, but they have difficulty retrieving that learning during an actual poker game.

How can we avoid this pitfall? To some extent, our psychology makes the problem is intractable. The further we move from the context of learning, the more difficult recall will be, period. But there are a few things we can do to make our learning more effective when crossing over contexts.

The first and most effective thing to do is *to try to emulate the native context*. I.e. do everything you can to make a hand history more like an actual hand of poker. Try to put every important hand you want to learn from in a hand replayer, so you get more visual feedback, like a real hand of poker. This might seem simple or a waste of time, but the cues it activates make it much more likely you'll be able to retrieve the learning in a real game. Even more powerfully&mdash;try visualizing the hand *as though it were real*. Try to invoke the poker-playing part of your brain to accept the conditioning you're receiving. Close your eyes and imagine the money amounts, what they would mean to you, the timer ticking down, and making the right play. The closer you get your experience of hand histories to the actual experience of playing poker, the more effective your learning will be. Go out of your way to make this happen! It's a pain, and it can sometimes seem awkward and unnecessary, but it'll dramatically improve your learning and retention in the long run.

A second thing you can do is to try to boil down your learning from hand histories (and forums and books) into cues that can be imported as self-talk. For example, let's say you read a hand that shows a great river 3-bet bluff. Instead of simply thinking to yourself, &ldquo;I'm going to do that next time&rdquo; (a commitment that usually never materializes), write down an actionable piece of self-instruction. For example, &ldquo;when you can rep the absolute nuts, 3-bet bluff the river.&rdquo; Keep that piece of paper with you the next time you play a session of poker; ideally, read over it periodically to remind yourself of this piece of self-instruction. This will make it much more likely that in the moment 3-bet bluffing the river is a possibility, this hand you read about will come back to you, and you'll be more likely to make an uncharacteristic play.

## The Hubris of Theory

In my last three articles, I have ardently extolled the virtues of poker theory and rigorous study. But I should also make clear that I don't believe theory is all-powerful. Some players, especially ones who are mathematically inclined, can have a rosy conception of how poker works. In their minds, poker is just a mathematical construct&mdash;a puzzle, with a discrete solution. They imagine that if locked in a room for 20 years with a calculator, they could develop a poker game so robust that it could take down the best player in the world.

These players imagine poker consists merely of figuring out a set of strategies, as though writing them out on a notecard&mdash;&ldquo;how to play poker&rdquo;&mdash;such that having the right set of strategies on your notecard will make your game impregnable. Of course, that's not how poker works. Poker must be *learned*; you must absorb that learning into your bones. Your brain must get conditioned into the right network, which takes many hundreds of thousands of hands. You needn't worry about mapping out all of your strategies, or obsessing over the mathematics. Focus on getting the learning into your fingers. I have known countless players who were more mathematically capable at describing poker than I was, but who couldn't stay afloat in a $1/$2 game.

Imagine a difficult poker hand you've played. You imagine, don't you, that there's some way to theoretically break this hand down and trace the &ldquo;right answer,&rdquo; like a scientist looking from above on his lab rat's maze? Theory will show you this&mdash;the right theory. This is what we believe. Why?

You want to see it from up there, the scientist's view, but in reality, you are the rat caught in the maze. You will never be the scientist. You're trapped, and you will always be. You don't have access to perfect theory, and you don't know how your theory is imperfect. It's quite possible that, in everything that you know, it's *impossible* for your &ldquo;theory&rdquo; to lead you to the optimal solution. You might believe in some part of your mind that poker is a beautiful, righteous, mathematically pristine game. But you, the learner of poker, are merely a rat in its maze, and you must find your way out. Reason will not always save you.

----

The limitations of poker theory are very real, and must be taken seriously. In my next article, I will be exploring the nature of poker theory and poker language, focusing on how we actually use them to inform our play. Turns out, poker logic is not nearly as pristine&mdash;or logical&mdash;as you think. Stay tuned for next article!

So I'm starting over.

I've decided to give away all of my money. Two years after retiring from poker, I have left about half a million dollars. I'm giving some of it to charity, and the rest to my family to go toward my parents' retirement. I'm leaving myself $10,000 to live off&mdash;you know, in case I'm an idiot and everything goes horribly wrong.

Oh, and I just finished the book, which I've been working on for the last two years (as most of you who follow my blog already know). It's finally for sale, and you can get it [here.](https://www.amazon.com/How-Be-Poker-Player-Philosophy-ebook/dp/B00HFDJU6A/)

### Wait, wait, what? You're giving away all your money? Why?

I know, right? What the hell?

Well, I wanted a fresh start. I wanted to use what I've been given to help people who have been less fortunate. I also wanted to support my parents, who have done so much for me throughout the tough times in my life. I've been lucky in so many ways, it's only right that I do what I can to pay it forward.

On the whole, poker was an amazing (and surreal) experience. It taught me a lot; it was very generous to me. But I don't want to live in the shadow of it. I want to prove to myself that I didn't need poker. That my career as a poker player was not my apex, but just another stepping stone toward the rest of my life.

### Okay, okay. So if you're giving it away, can I have some?

No. Unless you're running a registered charity, in which case maybe. I've made my first donation to[ ICCS, the Indigenous Cultural Conservation Society](http://www.tribalstruggle.org), and I'm looking to donate to three more, but haven't settled on the other charities for sure yet. I prefer smaller charities, to minimize administrative waste and, ideally, maximize investment directly into projects. Most mega-charities funnel so much money back into marketing and fundraising, oftentimes only half of your donation actually goes toward charitable work.

So if you know of any awesome charities I should look at, tell me about it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hosseeb). I'm still in the process of researching them, and I want to complete all the donations before the end of the year.

The rest is going toward my parents' retirement. The older I get, the more I realize what amazing human beings they are. When I was born, they were poor, struggling immigrants living out of a tiny little apartment. They inspire me. I don't expect my life to become quite like that, but I try to remember how hard my parents had it. Probably harder than I ever will. I think they deserve a break, and hopefully this will give them one.

### How are you going to live off $10,000? That won't last you too long.

I know! I've started cutting back on costs as much as I can. I've always lived pretty simply though, even when I was a poker player. But now, I'm trying to live as frugally as I can. I'm also learning how to cook. I just learned how to hard-boil eggs. Yes, learned. As in, I couldn't do it before.

I can't make this stuff up, guys.

### What charities are you donating to?

I'm donating a total of $75,000 over three or four charities. Right now, the first charity I've picked out is [ICCS, the Indigenous Cultural Conservation Society](http://www.tribalstruggle.org). I've sent them $20,000. They're a nonprofit whose primary work is with the Masaai of east Kenya, working to educate them on sustainable, efficient agricultural practices (in a region of the world that is suffering from rapid desertification). I really just fell in love with their work. I encourage you to check them out, they're awesome people working toward an important, sustainable solution. Send them a donation! Seriously! This cause needs all the help it can get.

Update: the other charities I've donated to are [The Simama Project](http://thesimamaproject.org/) ($20,000 for awarding comprehensive scholarships to 7 Kenyan children to get them through high school), [charity: water](http://www.charitywater.org/whywater/) ($20,000 to build and maintain 6 water wells in Dadu, Pakistan), and [GiveDirectly](http://givedirectly.org/) ($15,000, matched by another $15,000 from Good Ventures; learn more about GiveDirectly from their [TAL episode](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/503/i-was-just-trying-to-help)).

### Do you have proof you did all this stuff?

Yep.

### Well, damn. Okay. And what's this about your book?

Yes! I just finished it. It's for sale now&mdash;[you can get it here](http://www.amazon.com/How-Be-Poker-Player-Philosophy-ebook/dp/B00HFDJU6A/). I'm pricing it for the first month at $2.99, because I want to make it as affordable as possible as a favor to people just starting out in poker; after that, it'll be priced normally at $9.99. Go pick it up. I know a lot of you guys on my blog have read a lot of my writings already, but it's super polished and sexy, and there's some new content as well. Plus it's just cool to have an actual for-real book, right? That's what people tell me, anyway.

If you want to help me out, please write me a review! Share this story or Tweet about it. Tell your friend, &ldquo;hey, this pile of pages is pretty awesome, go read it.&rdquo; Everything helps. This book has been such a labor of love for me. I was eighteen years old when I came up with the idea for this book, and it's kind of amazing now to think now it's finally been released.

Man, oh man.

Anyway, go pick it up! What are you waiting for?!

### Ah! Stop yelling at me!

Don't be like that.

[For those of you who don't know what's going on with me right now, [read this post first.](http://www.haseebq.com/starting-over/)]

Christmas has come and gone. It's never been a big day for me and my family. We don't celebrate Christmas. So mostly Christmas is a day when everything is closed, my friends are busy, and everything is dim and quiet. For me, it's a lonely time of year.

Two days before Christmas, my younger brother and I went out and bought a shitload of fruit, about 600 apples and bananas in total. We drove down to Front Steps Shelter on Christmas morning and set them out for the lined up homeless outside.

It was a simple thing, really. But thinking about it, this has been the first Christmas in a long time that I've felt good about. It's a good start.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Og-KuHMb2Ek">[video]</div>

The book has been doing amazing. Since the day after its release, it's been consistently ranked #1 among all poker books, with no signs of waning. It's doing way better than I expected! Most of that was with no reviews at all, and even now it still only has a couple. I know it's going to take you guys a while to get through it, but once you do, **please [leave a review](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HFDJU6A)**! Even if you're not going to gush, just getting your feedback is a huge, huge help.

<span class="note">(And if you haven't picked up the book yet, the price is going to go up to $9.95 after the new year; if you're strapped for cash, you should pick it up before then. Also, for those who like the smell of paper, **[I've just gotten the print version made!! You can get it here,](https://www.createspace.com/4581115)** and it'll also be available on Amazon around New Year.)</span>

These last two weeks have been exhausting. Since making my last blog post, all the attention and craziness and skepticism has really taken a toll on my mind. I suppose that's to be expected, though. Some seemed to believe that I'm not really doing this, or it's all some kind of a trick. For a while, that really upset me. It's hard to have a deeply personal decision be impugned and doubted by onlookers. But as my close friends have admonished me, in so many words: screw the haters.

I feel like I'm in a better place. I'm ready to take on new projects. I want to start producing more content, and I'll tell you guys more soon. Right now, the first priority is getting the print version of the book out&mdash;personally, I'm anxious to hold the physical book for the first time. For whatever reason, it still doesn't feel quite real. I'd been working on this book for almost two years, and even after seeing it do really well, my brain hasn't registered that *I actually wrote a fucking book*. The book that I'd been wanting to write since I was 19 years old. I still have the crazy little scratched up document on one of my hard drives, entitled &ldquo;The Philosophy of Poker.&rdquo;

I'm proud of this book. I struggle to say that for some reason, but it's true. I'm proud of it.

Okay, enough about my goddamn feelings.

## Here are some updates on the donations:

$20,000 to [ICCS](http://www.tribalstruggle.org), the Indigenous Cultural Conservation Society: [receipt posted here](http://www.scribd.com/doc/194144975/ICCS-Donation-Receipt). You can read more about them in my [previous post](http://www.haseebq.com/starting-over/).

$20,000 to [The Simama Project](http://thesimamaproject.org/): [receipt posted here](http://www.scribd.com/doc/193967057/EW-Donation-Receipt-SimamaProjectQureshi). This is a great charity that is also based out of Kenya. Essentially, they work with Kenyan street children, and based on both need and academic merit, they award substantial scholarships to allow kids to get off the street and into school.

The scholarships cover tuition, books, food, and medical checkup, so they're substantial and comprehensive to ensure that a kid has enough to get into school and see it through, even if their home life is rough. I've been told that the best way to allocate the donation is to try to fund 7 children through the entirety of high school. More details will be forthcoming in February, which is apparently when their yearly cycle starts, and they determine their next potential candidates.

My plan for the next donation is to make it to [charity: water](http://www.charitywater.org/whywater/). So far I've looked into several water charities, and charity: water is the most promising one I've found so far. They are a larger charity (ranked 67/70 on CharityNavigator), and they have a wide range of projects, so I'll know more about what specific project(s) I'll be donating to in the upcoming days.

**Okay, I think that covers it for now.** If any of you guys have any more suggestions for a final charity, please [give me a shout](http://www.haseebq.com/connect/). I've looked into everything people have suggested so far, but I haven't found anything so far that fits the criteria I laid out. Just a note, since I'm getting a lot of suggestions of foreign charities&mdash;they have to have 501(c) status in the United States! Otherwise I'd have to pay extra taxes on the donation, which would ultimately mean I wouldn't be able to donate as much. So as much as all these foreign causes are awesome, I'm afraid they're out of reach for me for the time being.

I'll end with a quote, which has been on my mind since all this.

> How could we forget those ancient myths that stand at the beginning of all races, the myths about dragons that at the last moment are transformed into princesses? Perhaps all the dragons in our lives are princesses who are only waiting to see us act, just once, with beauty and courage. Perhaps everything that frightens us is, in its deepest essence, something helpless that wants our love.
>
>  So you mustn't be frightened, dear Mr. Kappus, if a sadness rises in front of you, larger than any you have ever seen; if an anxiety, like light and cloud-shadows, moves over your hands and over everything you do. You must realize that something is happening to you, that life has not forgotten you, that it holds you in its hand and will not let you fall. Why do you want to shut out of your life any uneasiness, any misery, any depression, since after all you don't know what work these conditions are doing inside you? Why do you want to persecute yourself with the question of where all this is coming from and where it is going? Since you know, after all, that you are in the midst of transitions and you wished for nothing so much as to change.

I made my final donation yesterday. The $75,000 is now all accounted for. I sent $20,000 to [charity: water](http://www.charitywater.org/) for building water wells in rural Pakistan, and $15,000 to [GiveDirectly](www.givedirectly.org) (matched by another $15,000 by [Good Ventures](http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/our-giving-season-plans)), which will be distributed through Kenya and Uganda. I'll be updating the [original post where I announce I'm starting over](https://haseebq.com/starting-over/) with more information and the receipts once I get them.

The [*print edition* of the book is finally available on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/How-Be-Poker-Player-Philosophy/dp/0991306740/ref=tmm_pap_title_0). If you've gotten through it and haven't left a review, please, please do. If you've bought my book or supported me, thank you! It has been amazing to see this book that I've put so much work into be received so well.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VvdhCmeFQfU">[video]</div>

It's now the eve of a new year, and of a new chapter in my life. The molting is over. I have to make the plan work now. I feel giddy, and a little scared.

Once the ceremony is over, all that's left are the duties of life.

It was late October that I first told my parents that I'd decided to give away my money. It was an awkward thing to explain. My father nodded. My mother cried. She cries easily. She said she had seen how much I had suffered over the years during my life as a poker player. What was the point of all that if I was just going to give all the money away now?

Later that night, I went for a walk, which turned into a run. I used to take midnight walks outside my parents' house when I was a teenager. The stars out there, 20 miles outside of Austin, look sharp like points of steel. As I was running up this hill, I looked up and remembered when I was just 16 years old, looking up from the very same place, all the things I used to fantasize about doing someday. It made me laugh.

I used to dream about becoming a 10/20 player&mdash;the highest stakes I could imagine playing then. I dreamed of making a hundred thousand dollars. I longed, so badly, to become a successful poker player. And here I was now, having done those things, and now giving them up. To be standing on that hill, absorbing it all, it was like a feeling of culmination. I had started this race seven years ago, and in that moment I realized, I'd finished. It was over. The long of my life suddenly lay far behind me. In that moment, I felt like more blood was pumping through my veins than I was supposed to have in me.

I was elated. For the first time in a long time, I was full of confidence. I felt sadness too, but it did not make me sad. I felt fear too, but it did not make me afraid.

----

Once the new year starts, there won't be much more to say about all this. It's largely over, now all that's left is for me to adapt to living cheaply and hustle to support myself. I've started eating two meals a day to cut down on costs (while still eating paleo), and slashed the rest of my expenses to the bare minimums.

But closing out this chapter would probably not be complete without addressing some of the criticisms that people have raised against my announcement a couple weeks ago. There are always going to be doubters and haters on the Internet, and a lot of the criticism is just silly or spiteful. But there are some issues that thoughtful people have raised, so I wanted to address them here.

First, there's the claim that giving money to my parents is not really giving it away, because I'll get it back in inheritance. This one's a little absurd, I think. My parents are in their fifties and relatively healthy. Statistically, if I do get any money back in inheritance (assuming I'm still alive to receive it), it'll be whatever they have left *after all they've spent in their retirement*, minus estate tax, divided equally among me and my two brothers, after 25 years of inflation (and you'd also have to account for the opportunity costs).

Then, there's the contention that this is all a big publicity stunt, and that I don't really mean it. If by this people mean to point out that I intentionally released my book at the same time as I made this announcement, then yes. I did release my book at the same time, very intentionally. Of course I did. The plan was to release my book and give away my money before the end of the year, and I worked my ass off to get it done in time. That's not insincere, it's not something I'm hiding or ashamed of, and it certainly doesn't make all this somehow not real.

I've started over with just $10,000. It won't last me long. I needed to start making some money to support myself. But if this was a &ldquo;publicity stunt,&rdquo; then it'd be a fairly stupid one, giving away hundreds of thousands in order to make a few thousand dollars from book sales. Books don't make a lot of money. I don't know if that comes as a surprise to people, but they don't. That being said, of course I'd want my book to sell well, and for as many people to read it as possible. I finished my first book, gave away my money, and then posted about it on my blog&mdash;which is the place I've always posted about major life decisions and events. Doing those two things in concert don't comprise a publicity stunt.

Third, there's the claim that charity isn't charity at all if you tell people about it. This actually gets at an interesting question, and one I want to take on directly.

Why do people do charitable things? Because it feels right. Because it connects them to their community. Because it makes them feel better about themselves. Psychologists will tell you it's for the &ldquo;[warm glow and social approval](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-compass-pleasure/201108/is-your-brain-charitable-giving).&rdquo; Some people do it to satisfy a moral duty, or to allay their shame, or guilt, or loneliness. If an act only counts as charity if the actor doesn't benefit in any way, then this completely dismisses a huge category of good things that people do. It fails to capture the breadth of what we mean by charitable behavior. Charity is simply giving to others. Everyone is getting *something* out of charity, otherwise they wouldn't do it. That doesn't make it wrong, or uncharitable.

And yes, most people who do good things do it in view of others. Of course we do; human beings are social animals. Do we lay suspicion upon every charity drive? Upon every act of public giving? The idea of &ldquo;if it were really charity, it would be done without telling anyone&rdquo; is just wrong. Again, it throws out almost all acts of charity, and it implies a false dichotomy. Assuming the only two categories are &ldquo;egoless saint&rdquo; and &ldquo;hapless sinner&rdquo; just misses a lot. Public, visible giving *encourages more giving*. It makes people think &ldquo;oh, that's awesome. I should do that too.&rdquo; This is a well-demonstrated phenomenon, and in fact, people have told me that they were inspired to donate to charity as well upon reading my blog post.

People do good for all sorts of reasons. So what? Let them do good things. *Encourage it.* It's easy to be cynical, to try to cast everything as self-interested. If you look hard enough, almost all of it inevitably is. But who cares? Find the good in the world. Let the good be found. Allow yourself to be pleasantly surprised. If you want more good people in the world, be one yourself. Criticizing others for being imperfect isn't the way to do it.

 I'll be the first to admit I'm imperfect. But I'm trying, and I'm not ashamed of trying, or of failing. I'm moving forward, and I'm doing my best. When I gave away my money, it was a good thing, and it sits right with me. That's all it comes down to.

I've got nothing but love for you guys. Here's to a new year and a new beginning.

Today I've edited and cleaned up a post that I wrote many years ago. Back then, I was a solid 3/6 6-max grinder. I was the biggest winner on the PokerStars 6-max games and put in tons of volume, but I could never move up to 5/10. Every time I tried, I'd get smashed and would return to 3/6 to retool my coffers and try again. This was really disheartening, and caused me to take a long, hard look at my game and my journey as a poker player. For all you midstakes players out there, this is for you, and I think it's quite appropriate for starting a new year. I hope you enjoy it.

<div class="center">*Play this song as you read.*</div>

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2wSU4adAbSc">[video]</div>**(Little Haseeb, circa 2007)**

Okay, lately I've been thinking a lot about my game and why I'm not making obscene amounts of money. **I've come to realize something absolutely incredible about the way that I understand this game and my place in it.** I realize that I have been utterly blind to this… and probably, you are too.

I have realized that there is a common attitude among MSNL players that's utterly toxic to their development. It's this: as MSNL players, we treat &ldquo;being good&rdquo; as a vague and ethereal property that we ascribe to someone's game. But we don't think about &ldquo;being good&rdquo; in terms of particular situations or discrete attributes. I admit, I am guilty of this as much as anyone else, and the more I think about it, the more I see what a painful tragedy it is.

What does it mean to be good at poker?

Good players tend to look like us. They play spots like us. We read their thought processes, and we can follow them quite clearly. They post in our threads and share our opinions a lot of the time. We feel like we are probably good players too. We just have a few leaks, they're just &ldquo;a little better.&rdquo; We don't wonder why, or how. We don't look at our game and lament, &ldquo;This guy is doing something right that I am doing wrong. He is making more money than I am by doing things that I am not doing. When I decide what play is the best play, he's deciding that totally different plays are better.&rdquo; No, not at all. *He is just kind of better, I am just kind of worse.* That's how it is. Maybe, over time, I'll become better like him.

In the mid-stakes poker world, there is a great deal of respect for &ldquo;style.&rdquo; There is a certain point of scrutiny past which we will refuse to analyze people. &ldquo;That's just his style,&rdquo; we'll say. &ldquo;That play makes sense, but it doesn't fit my style.&rdquo; Well, guess what. **Fuck you, and fuck your style**. There's a big, ugly misconception of &ldquo;style&rdquo; as something artistic or special, something that makes you individual and inherently interesting because you play a certain way. That is a bullshit excuse for the fact that you're unwilling to take risks that you're not sure will work out or don't understand. Or, shit. How about it's simple denial of the fact that you are in fact bad at poker, and there are people much better than you who are making completely different plays?

Don't try to justify yourself with style, and don't try to excuse yourself from learning from other people's lines and creativity with the excuse of &ldquo;style.&rdquo; If you are not beating 200/400NL, *then your &ldquo;style&rdquo; doesn't mean shit*; all it's doing is holding you back from making better and more interesting plays than your bullshit midstakes grinder mind can be comfortable with.

Your game is not just the behaviors and actions that you enact, but the thought processes behind them, which formed those behaviors in the first place. When you battle against good players for your winrate, those thought processes will be what define you. Over time, we solidify those thought processes into habits, and those habits we continually reuse in later spots without rethinking them. Now, this is not necessarily a bad thing! A vast majority of these habits, for players who can beat mid-stakes, are going to be perfectly fine at the lowest levels (i.e., at playing most basic hands correctly, at beating fish). But for every poker player, there is some level of complexity at which your habits can no longer dictate the action for you, and you are forced to rationalize a new decision that you have essentially never made before. That is, you are forced to face this moment as new and original. Your &ldquo;poker logic&rdquo; cannot solve the problem for you, and the ghost in the shell is called upon to make its executive decision.

Now, there are three things that separate a mediocre player from a great player in this respect. The first of these three things is that that the great player has habitualized many of the decisions that a mediocre player has to rationalize (that is, for a great player the ghost in the machine is called upon less often). That's because the great player has much more experience and can use his poker logic to generate solutions to more situations. The second thing is that a great poker player's poker logic will be finer attuned to making precise and optimal plays than the mediocre player's. His habits will be closer to optimal, and he will have fewer sloppy habits. But the last and most important difference is that the great player is capable of subtly re-rationalizing many of the spots which deviate slightly from habitualized spots; that is, where a more mediocre player might be inclined to treat different variations on the same theme exactly the same, a great player will see a subtle difference in these spots, call upon his ghost in the shell, and let it decree a variation upon the habit already in place.

One of the biggest pitfalls to moving up is that people pay a great amount of attention to very salient spots, such as huge river decisions and bluffs, but they do not take the time or effort to re-rationalize lower level situations that contribute most significantly to their winrate. If you keep the fundamentals mostly the same as when you played 2/4 when you move up to 3/6 or 5/10, it may appear as if you're playing not much differently than other people do in the large pots, but actually, you're likely sacrificing *lots of EV* in the smaller or medium sized pots because you are not re-rationalizing many of the decisions which you treated as routine at lower limits.

The distinctions you have to make to be a great player are very fine and numerous. I think that's probably one of the big reasons why very good players tend to shoot up the stakes **much** faster than most people. It's a rarity that somebody shoots up the ranks from 5c/10c to $2/$4 extremely quickly, and then can't move up any higher. The reason for this, I think, is that such a person will be very used to treating poker strategy as a constantly dynamic organism, which he will formulate and reformulate in many degrees and aspects in whatever game he is playing, whereas somebody who plays the same stakes for a long time will realize that he'll simply be wasting his mental energy if he tries to think out every single routine spot he plays. The human brain does not and cannot work that way. It's simply not economical. Over time those repeated patterns become imprinted on your subconscious mind, to such an extent that when someone points at a decision you're about to make and asks you, &ldquo;why are you doing this?&rdquo;-you can't tell them. Maybe you'll say, &ldquo;well, the variables X, Y, and Z of course,&rdquo; but that's not really why you did it. The truth is, the thought process **NEVER** consciously entered your mind; you were merely recalling a pre-formulated response to the situation.

Now, I don't doubt that any intelligent player will be able to re-rationalize the situation and explain after the action what the original thought process &ldquo;should have been,&rdquo; had you had actually thought it out. However, mistaking the ability to recall a thought process afterward with having actually thought out in the moment is simply a fallacy, and in the long run if you don't have the self-awareness to recognize it, this fallacy will be your undoing. That is not to say that rationalizing your thought processes has to be done verbally, but the point is that most of us don't truly rationalize most of our important decisions. What this means, if you think about it closely, is that most of our leaks, most of where we're making our biggest and most profound mistakes… we are passing over in silence. We don't even give ourselves the chance to realize it. We are closing our eyes and riding the waves, without ever trying to learn how to perfect the ship we're sailing on.

To bring this all back, I think again about myself. As I've been ruminating about poker over the last few days, it strikes me that I've been committing a terrible but subtle fallacy in thinking about the game. It seems almost like a form of denial when I put it into words now. I realize that I have been treating the game of poker as combat between competing pre-rationalized strategies. You see, for a long time while I was grinding out 3/6, I didn't really make most of my decisions. What I mean by that is, it was very rare that I respected somebody enough to decide that I needed to re-rationalize my decisions for medium-large sized pots. I believed that I would be capable enough of winning just by completely relying on the intuitions that I'd acquired simply playing an enormous number of hands 12-tabling. *But I did not realize this at all!* In fact, I probably have vehemently denied it if you accused me of such a thing.

I was a winner, and that kept me complacent enough to know that I could beat everyone I was playing with. But it never really occurred to me that a good player, if he moved down to 3/6, would be making 6-7 ptbb/100. 6 to 7! That's enormous! I could never sustain that. What would he be doing differently than what I'm doing to increase his winrate so much? What fundamental mistakes am I making that he wouldn't?? He would be playing so much better than me, making such better reads and decisions than I would-he would be looking at the very same spots, and continually make completely different decisions. **Why didn't that occur to me?? Why didn't it frighten me, terrify me, drive me? How could I simply rest, knowing how wrong I was, all the time?** I must've been treating a higher-level player, somebody who'd be able to make 6-7ptbb/100 at my stakes, as merely a set of pre-rationalized strategies that were more &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; than mine. He wouldn't be thinking these things out, he'd just have already thought them out a long time ago and routinized them, and so he'd be chugging along with the same absentness of mind as I had. *But why do I let that excuse me from my own mediocrity? Why can I be okay with that?*

**Fuck. Fuck me. Fuck, fuck, fucking fuck.**

God, I don't know. This probably sounds like nonsense to a lot of you and maybe it is, I don't know. Poker is fucking crazy, and I'm really bad at it, and I want to get better.

Well, let me leave you with just one thought.

There are only three moves in poker: calling, betting, and folding. How can somebody who's only allowed to call, bet, or fold, be making so much more money than me?? It's only call, bet, or fold, but his decisions are making him so much more money than mine!

Cliffnotes: Shit, I gotta start call, betting, or folding better.

Thanks for reading,
**Little Haseeb**

My first ever purchase as a poker player wasn't made with money. It was made with FPPs. About a year after I started playing poker, I was $3/$6 reg with over $70,000 to my name, and I decided to cash in my FPPs on Pokerstars to buy an iPod. I was 16 years old, and my parents didn't have the slightest idea that I was a poker player, much less making tens of thousands of dollars. I still remember getting that iPod in the mail, slipping it out of the thin plastic wrap, and feeling its undeniable weight in my hands. I'd never had an iPod before. It seemed like an extravagant thing to have. Examining my name, engraved on the back of the metal case, I felt like I had gotten away with something. I wasn't supposed to have this.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gtq-RJCBWGE">[video]</div>

Much later, after confessing to my parents that I was playing poker, after becoming a well-known high-stakes player, after making over a million dollars playing $100/$200 by the age of 19, that feeling still persisted. Why did I have money? No one ever explained it to me. I was just playing poker, this game that fascinated me. But soon, I was buying a new car, investing in a house, furniture, a giant TV, 30″ monitors. My small blind was more expensive than any dinner I'd ever eaten, or any item I could buy in a supermarket. What did that mean? What was the point? Was I supposed to know?

As a young poker player, I was ushered into a very unhealthy relationship with money. It's a common theme among young poker pros. But unhealthy money habits are not limited to poker superstars. Even more common are the players who continually cash out, spend frivolously above their means, and are always broke or in debt.

Poker teaches us to dissociate money from its usual context. We're constantly drilled toward that idea&mdash;don't be results oriented, it's just chips, play without fear. After enough of this, most poker pros will eventually be able to change their perception of money at a poker table. It will no longer be betting a month's rent, or the down payment on a house&mdash;it will just be another move at a poker table.

But divorcing money from its usual context can be dangerous if it leaks over into your behavior away from the poker table. Once you start to think of an three-course meal or an expensive night out as &ldquo;just a buyin,&rdquo; frivolous spending becomes easier to justify. In poker we allow ourselves to lose; we accept our ups and downs as simply a matter of fact. Why not in life, too?

It's easy to get caught in this trap. Money comes easy in poker&mdash;it goes up and down all the time. But by continually cashing out and spending lots of money, a poker player puts a heavy strain on his bankroll. That much is obvious. But what are less obvious are the systematic effects of that strain on your poker game.

Having a low bankroll, clearly, makes it more likely you grow broke. But chances are, you're not too afraid of that, and perhaps you're convinced you'll move down when that risk draws near (when it comes down to it, you might, you might not). Very few people who go broke ever suspect they're going to. But going broke isn't the only danger to a poker player. Much more dangerous are the effects that having a slim bankroll will have on your mentality while you're playing poker.

If you're playing with 30 buyins and have to move down if you lose 10, you're much more likely to feel like you need to win *this session*. You're more likely to feel that this day, hand, or play needs to go right. After all, if it doesn't, the stakes are high&mdash;you'll have to move down, and your mind recoils from that idea. So playing with a low bankroll will make you more likely to tilt, to feel desperate, and to constantly be playing at the margins of safety. Your unconscious incentives will rock back and forth, like a boat in a storm. This problem is only compounded by, for example, having an impending cashout you're going to make at the end of the month, at which point you'll *definitely need to win*. This state of mind is clearly not a good place for a poker player to be playing from.

Cashouts are a part of poker. But if used thoughtfully, they can be a powerful tool to organize your progression. Instead of cashing out a usual amount every month, why not instead use your cashouts strategically? Allow yourself special cashout bonuses when you hit certain goals, like a certain number of hands per month, or not tilting for 10 days straight. Ideally, put your cashout money to experiences you want to have, rather than toward unnecessary material goods; experiences are better motivators, and according to behavioral science, are more likely to make you happy. Used properly, cashouts are one of our most powerful incentives as poker players. If you just cashout the same amount every month no matter what, you're simply throwing away a powerful source of motivation and direction.

If you are up-and-coming in poker, it is vitally important that you limit your spending. Allow your poker bankroll to grow and flourish; give yourself the chance to move up; let your sprouting poker game grow into a healthy tree. If you live minimally (but well), use cashouts to motivate yourself, and give your bankroll as much breathing room as possible, you will become a better and more focused of a poker player, and you'll move up much faster.

Ultimately, once your relationship with money is habitualized, it becomes much harder to change it. For my own part, this is something I've had to work to repair over time. And now, trying to live with $10,000, money has much more weight than it used to. The anxiety of spending $20 on dinner is something that, before, I couldn't even imagine. Now, it's a fact of life. But in time, I'm going to figure out a healthy way to relate to money. For me, as for anyone, that just comes with time and thoughtful effort.

Money can be a great mental burden, and to many people, it is. But the goal, in my mind, is to find the middle way. There are those who worship money, and those who fear it. But those who respect money are, I think, the most happy&mdash;and the most free.

*What's the secret to playing pocket jacks?*

This is probably one of the most common questions in poker, and yet no one seems to have come up with a satisfactory answer to the question. Here, I'm going to examine why that is, and give you my own take on the answer.

I was in a coffeeshop a few weeks ago browsing the internet, when I came across [this article](http://www.csun.edu/~dgw61315/thetwothings.html) by Glen Whitman called &ldquo;The Two Things.&rdquo; In it, he recounts the story of the Two Things.

> A few years ago, I was chatting with a stranger in a bar. When I told him I was an economist, he said, &ldquo;Ah. So… what are the Two Things about economics?&rdquo;
>
> &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; I cleverly replied.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qt-nxXlsjTs">[video]</div>

> &ldquo;You know, the Two Things. For every subject, there are really only two things you really need to know. Everything else is the application of those two things, or just not important.&rdquo;
>
> &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Okay, here are the Two Things about economics. One: Incentives matter. Two: There's no such thing as a free lunch.&rdquo;
>
> Ever since that evening, I've been playing the Two Things game. Whenever I meet someone who belongs to a different profession (i.e., a profession I haven't played this game with), or who knows something about a subject I'm unfamiliar with, I pose the Two Things question.

He then goes on to compile some interesting &ldquo;Two Things&rdquo; that people have come up with about their respective fields. Many of them were poignant, insightful, and a few of them were quite amusing.

> The Two Things about English Literature:
>  1. The text is really about writing.
>  2. Writing is really about sex.
> *-Marya*
>
> The Two Things about World Conquest:
>  1. Divide and Conquer.
>  2. Never invade Russia in the winter.
> *-Tim Lee*

So I thought to myself&mdash;well, I'm supposed to be an expert on poker. What are its Two Things? To work well, they're supposed to be two principles of thought from which you could potentially derive all of poker theory. Every piece of strategy should boil down to these two principles. I thought about it for some time, and decided, if I were to try to simplify all of poker play and theory into two principles, it'd be these:

> **The Two Things about Poker:**
>
> 1. Every piece of information narrows down handranges
>
> 2. People are bad at being random

You could surely invent other &ldquo;Two Things&rdquo; about more specific subjects such as live poker, tournaments, heads up, variance etc. This was just my first take on it. If any of you guys have ideas as to what you think are the Two Things about poker, leave a comment&mdash;I'd love to read them.

Until next time,

Today, I've got a special treat: I recorded a preview of the audiobook! Hear a great section from the book, &ldquo;Tilt: the Customer is Always Right,&rdquo; which teaches how to play optimally against a tilting player.

Of course, you also get to enjoy my chocolatey voice in its full aural deliciousness. It's okay, it's not weird that you like it. It just makes you more of a man.


<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xNAKaXUDfBU">[video]</div>

Hope you enjoyed! The audiobook should be released soon; I'll be working through the recording this weekend. Look forward to it, and be sure to pick it up once it comes out–you know, so I'm not wearing out my voice for nothing.

Lately, I've been thinking about the infamous &ldquo;million dollar bet&rdquo; I made back in 2011. Today, I thought I'd repost the original story on this blog so it's all here in one place. I was originally planning to rewrite it, but I've decided instead that I should post the whole thing unedited. It was very raw when I wrote it, and that rawness comes through in the writing. It's an intense story&mdash;just reading it takes me back.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FuB00XfRNjo">[video]</div>

## Part One

I'm writing this sitting in my car at a rest stop somewhere in the panhandle of Florida. I am reclining in my chair trying to get comfortable, but I can't. I have all my stuff packed into the trunk and back seat. Rain is pelting the windshield, casting speckled shadows on my hands. I'm tired but I can't sleep. I don't know what time it is. Maybe 11, maybe midnight. I haven't been able to sleep well lately. The last few days have been tough.

I wasn't sure how to write about this. I wasn't sure what kind of a story there was to tell, or who really I would be writing a story for. Ultimately I just know that I need to express what I'm feeling and what I've gone through.

I suppose everything began last year. I took a long break from the game; I was away from poker for about 9 months after I got hacked. I was focusing on my own life&mdash;on getting healthy in both mind and body, and I was keeping my distance from the world of poker. I would attempt a few times to get my head back into the game, but it just wouldn't stick. I just didn't have that same drive to keep playing the game.

<div class="center">♠</div>

When I went to Vegas for the first time when I was 20 (July 2010), I met a lot of poker players I'd only known online, and one of those players was Jungleman. I found he and I had a lot of perspectives in common and he really admired me. We spent a lot of time hanging out and decided that we might live together at some point later in the year. We settled on going to San Diego around October, and we invited Ashton who we both knew to come live with us. He was going to school and wrestling at the time so he couldn't leave Orlando, but he ended up offering us to both come down to Orlando and live with him. It seemed like a good idea, since all three of us were strong poker players and we were all young.

So we did. Jungleman and I came to Orlando. The three of us spent a lot of time together&mdash;playing poker, feeling out the city, being young and stupid. For me this experience was a great opportunity since it was a chance for me to get my head back into the game, to focus, study poker, and to learn from these two really great players. It helped to re-ignite my passion for the game and also get my poker game back on track. I was a lot more mature than the two of them. Both Ashton and Jungle respected me. They would call me the &ldquo;papa bear&rdquo; of the house. I looked after them.

It was an interesting relationship between the three of us. But, well, I suppose the real story starts a few days ago.

<div class="center">♠</div>

Doug, a.k.a. WCGRider, had come to spend a week with us in Orlando. Jungle was supposed to be back from Australia on the 4th, but he ended up getting delayed so he wouldn't be back after Doug was gone. So it was just me, Ashton, and Doug.

Ashton had decided to buy some tickets to the Magic-Heat game on Thursday night. He offered me a ticket to the game, but I passed. I didn't feel like going. He ended up taking Doug as well as some other friends.

It was rowdy, they did a lot of drinking, and after the game they went to House of Blues for a concert. Doug later recounted the story to me: he went up to the bar at House of Blues to buy some drinks. Ashton came up to him and said &ldquo;Hey, don't worry about it man, I'll get the drinks, it's fine.&rdquo;

Doug said, &ldquo;Nah , don't worry about it. You already bought the tickets, I got the drinks man.&rdquo;

Ashton replied &ldquo;Well, thanks…  …You know… I feel sad all the time.&rdquo;

Doug looked at him.

&ldquo;I feel anxious and depressed, and I haven't been happy in a long time.&rdquo; Doug listened with a seriousness amidst this concert at the House of Blues.

&ldquo;Well man, if you want help, all of us are here and are willing to help you.&rdquo;

He continued, &ldquo;If you want to get your shit together, you need to stop all the prop-betting, you need to stop all the craziness, you need to just focus on poker, on school, and on your health man. And you can do it. We all know you can.&rdquo;

Ashton smiled at him. &ldquo;Yeah, you're right. I can do it. I can change.&rdquo; And then the night went on. Ashton ended up leaving with a girl around 3AM. Doug and Ashton's sister who had also gone to the concert ended up driving back to the house by themselves.

<div class="center">♠</div>

Now, I was having trouble sleeping that night. I'm usually the first person awake, but I'd gotten up especially early that morning and ate breakfast. At about 11 I came into the living room and saw Doug sitting on the couch playing poker, and Ashton sitting at his computer. Ashton had only gotten home five or six hours ago, and had slept maybe four hours. He'd drunk quite a lot the previous night. He was on Skype with Justin Smith.

Doug and I watched as Ashton asked him to set up a prop bet with him. The very next morning, after four hours of sleep, Ashton was trying to set up a prop bet with Justin as to whether or not he could run 70 miles in a day. Justin was hesitant to accept&mdash;the more Justin hesitated, the higher Ashton raised the odds.

&ldquo;1-1.&rdquo;

&ldquo;No, no, no…&rdquo; Justin replied.

&ldquo;Okay, 2-1&rdquo;

&ldquo;No…&rdquo;

&ldquo;Okay, 3-1… 3.5-1, because you're my friend.&rdquo;

As this went on, Doug and I exchanged looks as if to say&mdash;is he really doing this? Ashton looked at me and said &ldquo;Haseeb, 3-1 sounds fair right? You'd take this bet at 3-1?&rdquo;

I looked at him incredulously, glanced at Doug, and replied &ldquo;Uh yeah, 3-1 sounds fair.&rdquo;

Ashton turned back to his PC and finally said, &ldquo;alright man, I just really want to do this run… 5.5-1.&rdquo;


Justin simply said, &ldquo;I'm going to sleep&rdquo; and hung up. Ashton was visibly frustrated.

He then turned to me and said &ldquo;Alright, you're booking that right?&rdquo; And I said &ldquo;Well dude, I'm not sure that's such a great idea.&rdquo;

&ldquo;No man, I'm going to do this. I can do 70 miles no problem. I know my body.&rdquo; We discussed it and asked what's the most he'd ever run before. He told us that the most he'd ever run in one stretch was twenty-two miles. Ashton is very athletic; he's a collegiate-level wrestler, he ran cross-country in high school, and he'd run 13 miles just a couple of days prior. He's extremely fit. But he'd never even run a complete marathon in his life. He looked at me and said, &ldquo;What's the most you can do?&rdquo; I considered this for a minute.

As I was looking at him I thought to myself…I've been in this situation before. I've seen Ashton make lots of silly prop bets. I've seen him get scammed, burned, taken advantage of countless times, and I've also seen him offer a lot of silly prop bets that weren't in his favor. Every time I've refrained from taking part; refrained from having anything to do with it. I know that he fucks up a lot, and I know that he's a degenerate sometimes. I've known Ashton for years and I've watched him travel down his road. Many times along the way I've tried to stop him, to advise him, to pull him out of harm's way, but ultimately he finds himself there again and again.

I had come to realize that I can't stop Ashton from doing these things. I knew that no matter what I said or did, he was determined to do this prop bet. I know him, I know the frustration and anxiety he's been feeling, and I know the look in his eyes and the resolve in his voice. I thought there was no way that he could run 70 miles. The way I saw it, he was ready to grab a handful of his money and throw it into the wind. I can't save him. I can't stop him.

I replied, &ldquo;Alright, I can do 70. 70k for your 210.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Alright, it's booked,&rdquo; he replied. He finished eating his Dunkin' Donuts and ran upstairs to change into his shorts. It was around noon then. We set up the terms of the bet&mdash;he was given a span of 24 hours to complete the run. He had to maintain a running speed at all times on the treadmill&mdash;any walking or anything below that given speed would not count toward his total. He was free to take as many breaks as he needed. Doug up took a small piece as did another friend, but most of the action was mine.

He scurried off with a spring in his step to the nearby gym to start his running. And so at 12:30 PM on Friday the 4th of February, the bet began.

<div class="center">♠</div>

Doug and I began making phone calls. Anyone and everyone we knew who was knowledgeable about running, who had run marathons, who knew anyone who had run marathons. We asked people if they thought it was possible&mdash;some guy who's a collegiate wrestler who used to run cross country in high school, who had never run a complete marathon in his life. The overwhelming consensus that I got was that his chance to win was low, and some pegged it at close to 0%. Everyone who I asked about it was skeptical, and once I told them that he wasn't allowed to walk, I was told it would be close to impossible for somebody without any training in supermarathon running. To top it off… I hadn't mentioned to anyone that he'd been drinking the previous night and had gotten four hours sleep, or that he was offering me 3-1 on the bet.

At that point I thought that if all these people think Ashton can't do it, then there's no way he can win. He thinks he knows his body, but you can't know how your body would respond to that level of physical and psychological stress if you've never been there. He can't know. He can't know what three back-to-back marathons would do to his calves, to his knees, or to his heart. He still had alcohol in his system and had gotten almost no sleep, and I knew that he was feeling anxious. I figured this is Ashton standing in front of the railroad tracks again&mdash;this is him sitting at 500/1k heads up against Phil Ivey with his roll, desperate to have something change, for something to rile him up, to feel alive and meaningful again. He wanted to make himself the hero. The way I saw it, there was no way that Ashton could do this.

<div class="center">♠</div>

Doug and I went back and forth from the apartment complex gym where he was running. We brought him Gatorade, power bars, water bottles, and checked up on him to make sure he was alright and watched his progress. His sister decided to spend the day with us (after learning what he was doing), and helped us out ferrying food and drink back and forth. We watched him, kept track of time, and measured up his progress. At that point, it still seemed like just a frivolous spur-of-the-moment bet. I figured that my role was to make sure that Ashton was going to be okay once he got through to the other side&mdash;that after he gave up or lost the bet, that he'd be able to get his mind back together and get back on his feet. I knew it'd be hard on him when he lost.

Around 2PM Doug and I went to Ruby Tuesday's to get lunch. While we were eating, we got a text from Ashton saying that he was looking for more action, and that he was going to find other people to buy it up so he could put up 900k of his own money. I remember when he read that text aloud to me, Doug looked at me dumbfounded. We had no idea how to take it. The first thought that came to our minds was that Ashton was self-destructing. That he was putting it all on the line, and wanted all-or-nothing. I remember thinking that the sweat-drenched Ashton, in that musky little gym probably felt happier and more alive running on that treadmill than he had in some time. He had meaning in that moment. He must've felt that every pound of his muscle, every strain of his body had a meaning and clear direction behind it. He knew exactly what he was fighting for, what he was hurting for.

So I texted him, &ldquo;alright, I'll buy up the rest.&rdquo; He texted back, &ldquo;Are you sure about this?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah, I'm sure. My 285k plus the other 15k you have booked makes 300k. Consider it booked.&rdquo;

I thought to myself, he's giving money away. He's not going to stop until he sells off all of that action and puts up 900k of his own money. If I know he's going to throw 600k into the wind, what difference would it make if it were my hand that caught it instead of somebody else's? I mean, that's what poker players do isn't it? They make their plays where the money is. They don't hold grudges. We're just two poker players, playing a game. Whoever wins just made the right decision in that moment, and the loser understands that. It's not personal. Poker isn't personal. Well, it's not supposed to be, anyway.

As we drove back to the apartment complex, Doug and I were reflecting on how bizarre and fucked up the whole situation was. This was the most money I'd ever put on anything like this&mdash;I'm not a prop bettor, and the most I've ever bet on something was less than $1,000. It just felt surreal. Just talking about it made it start to feel more and more incredible (in the literal sense of the word). Doug said to me &ldquo;Well you have to admit, either way, Ashton is a fucking animal.&rdquo;

I replied, &ldquo;Well, that's true, but we're not betting on whether or not Ashton is an animal. We're betting on whether he can run these 70 miles today.&rdquo;

<div class="center">♠</div>

Once we returned, I caught up with Ashton on his way back to the gym and we spoke briefly. He asked me if I was sure I wanted to do this, and I told him I was. He said to me, &ldquo;Why? Do you think that I can't do this? Do you think I don't know my body?&rdquo;

I chose my words carefully. &ldquo;I…I just think the odds are too good man. I can't pass up this bet.&rdquo;

He said, &ldquo;Okay, then if you want to take this action there are two terms you have to agree to. The first is that you think there's a 0% chance that I would cheat. That doesn't mean you think there's a 1% chance that I'd cheat and you'll live with it, but you have to literally think there's a 0% chance I'd cheat you.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Yeah, I know you're not going to cheat. Don't worry.&rdquo;

He continued, &ldquo;Alright. The second term is that… this doesn't affect our friendship, even if I win. Or if I lose. We're still friends.&rdquo;

I studied him, thought for a moment and said, &ldquo;Well, if you lose, are you still going to be friends with me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, if I lose I'm not going to hate you. So it's fine, we'll still be friends.&rdquo; I patted him on the back, and then we shook hands. Thinking back, it didn't feel like a million dollar handshake. Actually, I'm not sure what that would feel like, haha. I suppose it still didn't feel real. I just figured I'd regret it if instead of me some random poker player out there was 600k richer tomorrow. I kept making what I thought was the right move, but it would take me a while to process the gravity of what I had agreed to.

<div class="center">♠</div>

Ashton returned to the treadmill and started running again. It was 2PM then, and my anxiety was starting to build. I remember telling Doug, &ldquo;You know, for 70k I could almost be zen about it. Losing 70k would suck, but I'd be alright. I could still focus on other things. But 285k man… the difference between winning and losing… -285k or +855k. This is a million dollar bet. I didn't realize this, but I'm not going to be able to play poker today man. Hell, I'm not going to be able to think about anything else…&rdquo; He told me, &ldquo;of course, what did you expect? You've got one hell of a sweat ahead of you man.&rdquo;

Time dragged by slowly. Doug and Ashton's sister continually updated me on his progress every half-hour, and I passed the time calculating Ashton's progress and mileage rate. I spent a lot of the time talking to friends and trying to keep myself grounded. I spoke to a friend of mine (who isn't a poker player) about the bet and he asked me, &ldquo;So what are you going to do when you win your 850k?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Well, I don't know if I'm going to win yet. I could lose. But if I do win, I'm probably just going to buy a car and put the rest away.&rdquo; He chuckled. &ldquo;What, like a hundred thousand dollar car?&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;Nah, probably more like a 30k car.&rdquo; He knows me, and I'm not a flashy person when it comes to money&mdash;I live pretty simply, and I prefer it that way. He said to me, &ldquo;Ah, man. Money is wasted on the rich.&rdquo; I laughed.

<div class="center">♠</div>

Ashton returned to the house several times, complaining that he felt tired a lot sooner than he expected. Around 4PM he curled up on the couch and announced to us that he was going to sleep for a bit. He didn't sleep, and ten minutes later he got up and went back out to run again. At 6PM he returned and announced that he was going to sleep for a few hours in his room. He stayed in his room for ten minutes, told us that he felt energized already, and then was out the door again. Ashton was completely unable to sleep. Doug and I figured that was definitive&mdash;he wouldn't be able to win. Without rest, his body wouldn't hold up.

At around 8PM, I spoke to a friend of mine who had some experience in running marathons. I told her the entire story, about how Ashton was feeling out of it, how he was unable to sleep, and that he'd been drinking heavily the night before. She told me with an unexpected graveness&mdash;&rdquo;You guys need to be watching him constantly.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;Well, we're checking up on him every half hour or so, bringing him food and drink and stuff.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no, you guys need to be there in case something happens. If he collapses or gets a heart attack, he'll need immediate medical attention. Somebody needs to be there. Like, right now. The likelihood will only go up the longer that kid runs.&rdquo;

Slowly, the realization settled in. I know Ashton, and I know how much heart he has. He's a beast. He'll keep pushing and pushing until the brink of his physical limits. The question was never whether Ashton had the force of will to win this bet, but whether or not his body could withstand it. In reality, I knew that Ashton wouldn't give up. The bet I was making was that Ashton would be physically incapable of going any further. I was betting that Ashton would either: pull a muscle and be unable to run, collapse from exhaustion, damage his joints, or have a heart attack. There was no other way that he would lose.

From that point, Doug and I agreed to watch him constantly, but before we could commit to a vigil Ashton had returned home around 9:30 PM. He said that he was going to sleep again, and this time he was in his room for a while. Doug and I waited around along with Ashton's sister in the living room downstairs. It all felt uneasy. Ashton's sister asked, &ldquo;Do you guys think he's sleeping?&rdquo;

Doug told us that he'd seen Ashton earlier when he stepped in to use the bathroom. He said that Ashton was sitting on his bed, just rocking quietly back and forth. &ldquo;There's no way he'll be able to sleep,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When I did my prop bet, I had to do something like that. It was different, but just like Ashton I had a time constraint and a lot of pressure. I remember I would play and play for hours during the day, and then when I realized I was tired I'd crawl into bed. But when I got into bed, I would stare up at the ceiling and all I could think about was the playing that I could be doing, and I would think about the fact that I wasn't sleeping, and I would get scared that instead of lying here staring at the ceiling I could be playing more hands, and then I'd get up and go try to play again… and when I realized I was too sleepy, I'd go back to bed and try again. The sleep was the hardest part. It's impossible to sleep when you're scared and the adrenaline is rushing. Trust me, Ashton won't be able to sleep.&rdquo;

Ashton's sister asked if there was anything she could do to help him sleep. He shook his head. The story seemed to be getting more and more fucked up the longer it went on. I wasn't expecting any of this. Ashton was going through something truly horrible. Rocking back and forth in that bedroom… all the fear and confusion he must've been feeling… us sitting downstairs waiting for our friend to give in. He was falling behind pace to win the bet. I was supposed to be relieved, but I felt miserable. The entire thing started to feel perverse.

<div class="center">♠</div>

Around 10:30PM his sister told us that Ashton's parents were on their way up here from Ft. Lauderdale, 3 hours away. Doug and I had no idea what to think. According to his sister, he had called his mother and simply told her &ldquo;You need to come up here. I need your help.&rdquo; His sister had tried to get them to turn around, but they were insistent on driving up. This whole affair started to feel more and more like it was spiraling out of control, and we were now going to have to explain to his parents the whole situation. Doug was taken aback, but I was prepared to tell his parents everything.

It was almost 11:00PM and Ashton was still in his bedroom. He had completed 30 miles of the 70. Midnight would be the halfway point in the bet, and it seemed that he still had not gotten a wink of sleep. At this point, I was positive that the bet was over. Ashton had simply underestimated his own exhaustion. He had not even reached half of the mileage&mdash;and the first marathon would be the easiest. There was no way he could run the second and third marathons at a faster pace. I thought my role would be to explain to his parents what all had happened and why. I thought it was over.

Half an hour later, his parents arrived and went straight upstairs to Ashton's room. Doug and I sat in the living room wringing our hands, unsure of what was going to happen. We spoke to each other in quieted voices, almost rehearsing how we were going to explain it to them. Finally, we saw them descending the stairs and taking notice of us in the living room. His mother smiled at me warmly, offered her hand and said &ldquo;Hi, I'm Julia.&rdquo; I introduced myself, and she walked toward the kitchen to set down her purse. &ldquo;I can't believe what Ashton's doing,&rdquo; she said perhaps to herself, &ldquo;I can't believe how reckless he's being… but most of all I can't believe the people who are making Ashton do this.&rdquo;

Doug and I looked at each other. She didn't realize that we were the ones he was betting against. I stepped into the entranceway of the kitchen as she leaned back against a countertop, and announced to her, &ldquo;well actually Julia. We're some of the people who bet against Ashton. Not only us. We and several others.&rdquo;

The moment she heard me say that, she broke eye contact and tightened her shoulders. Her demeanor changed entirely. She bit her lip as I started to tell the story, from the very beginning… not omitting any details… about how I knew her son, about our relationship, about how the bet began, about what had happened thus far… about how much money was at stake… about the risks he was taking…, and I remember telling her &ldquo;Ultimately, Ashton called you two here for a reason. He wanted you two to see something. What that is, I can't say, but all I know is that you two need to listen to what he's trying to tell you.&rdquo; I remember feeling confident in my words.

&ldquo;You say you're his friend Haseeb?&rdquo; From then on, she didn't speak to me… she spoke AT me. She didn't look me in the eye again. &ldquo;No, real friends wouldn't put their friends health at risk to try to take his money. You knew exactly what it meant when you bet against Ashton. You're not his friends.&rdquo;

We protested. No, I said, he was going to do this anyway. I couldn't stop him. He was going to do it anyway. I was helping him wasn't I? I was worried about him wasn't I? I was watching over him wasn't I? What difference did it make whether it was my money or someone else's?

&ldquo;No Haseeb, you two aren't his friends. It's all about money isn't it? That's what you guys want right? That's what you're here for, that's why you're making my son do this?&rdquo;

No, no. No…

&ldquo;Right, well your actions say otherwise. Well, Ashton isn't going to do this,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I'm not going to let risk my son's health so that you two can get your payday. He's not going to do this bet.&rdquo;

Well… that's not your call.

&ldquo;No, it is my call. I said he's not going to do this. There's no amount of money that's worth risking his health for, and if you were his friends you would know that. You two can find me and come to me personally and… I'll figure out how to pay you. But this bet is over. You guys will get your money.&rdquo;

Doug and I looked at each other. I didn't know what to say. She looked at me like I was a complete piece of shit. The parents went back upstairs to check on Ashton again, leaving Doug and I standing in the kitchen. I walked to the living room and sank into the couch.

I knew that as his parents, they were bound to feel that way. There was no other perspective they could have, really… I could see why they would think that we were just scum. I had seen Ashton cheated, ripped off, taken advantage of by countless people before. It would make sense that not knowing the situation, she'd think of me as just another one of those people. Of course she would. But I couldn't shake what they said. It stuck with me, and slowly gnawed at my mind. The memory feels raw. I still remember it.

## Part Two

I've arrived safely in Austin at my parents' house. My car parked on the street and is still packed with all my stuff. It's been a while since I've spent the night here. I'm sleeping in the guest room, since the bed in my old bedroom is too small for me now. There was a big storm here last night. I woke up a couple times in the middle of the night to hail pounding the roof and windows creaking. It's still cloudy this morning, but the weather has calmed. I have forgotten how quiet this place can be.

Earlier today I read some of the comments on the first part of my blog. I wasn't surprised at the assortment of awe, compassion, and indignation. But ultimately, this story isn't about other people, and it's not something I wrote to be gawked at or as a testimony for others to pass judgment upon, although I have no qualms if they do so. I have thought about these events a lot in the last few days that I've been driving on the road back to Austin. They say silence is fertilizer for the soul. When you're alone only with your thoughts, all you can really think about is the things you've done, about where your life is going, and who you are.

I wrote this story because I think it's an important story to tell, for myself and for others to learn from. Writing this isn't about making myself feel better, or to try to justify anything that happened. It's about owning who I am and how I feel about what happened that day. The rest, as they say, is history.

<div class="center">♠</div>

The parents had gone upstairs to check up on Ashton again, and Doug and I were slinked on the couch downstairs. At that point, we were only waiting. For what, we didn't know. Ashton's mother had declared to us that the bet was over, but we knew that Ashton wasn't going to simply concede. We knew he was going to fight and insist that he could go on and pull it off. The time was almost 11:45, and he was still less than halfway through the distance. I thought the bet was over and we were going to deal with the aftermath. I remember sitting there on that couch and just feeling guilty and uncertain. We waited.

Finally around 12, Ashton's sister (who had defended us to his parents) came downstairs. She told us they were trying to talk to him, but Ashton wasn't saying much…all he said was he wanted pasta. She asked if either of us knew how to cook spaghetti. Doug and I looked at each other. &ldquo;You do know we're poker players right?&rdquo; She shook her head at us, and we laughed.

I went into the kitchen with her and poked around getting a pot ready for boiling spaghetti, and she gave me instructions while she returned upstairs into Ashton's room with the rest of her family. So I stood over the stove and watched the spaghetti. I remember asking Doug as I was standing over the stove, &ldquo;Do you think I just came across to his parents as a total prick? I don't understand it. I mean I look out for Ashton don't I? I'm his friend aren't I? They were talking to me like I'm a slimy piece of shit. He was going to do this anyway, I know I couldn't stop him…I don't have control over him. I can't help someone who doesn't want my help.&rdquo;

He told me thoughtfully, &ldquo;Well man…I think you're right. And I think they're right too. The answer probably lies somewhere in the middle, really. I don't think you did anything wrong. I don't think Ashton thinks you did anything wrong. And if I were his parents and I saw this whole mess, I'd probably react the same way.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I know man, I know. I would too if I were his parents. But I just can't shake this feeling. I feel like shit about this whole thing.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Well, we're in it now. We just gotta deal with it,&rdquo; he told me. The spaghetti softened slowly, and sunk to the bottom of the pot.

<div class="center">♠</div>

Ashton finally came downstairs. He was wearing sweatpants and a black hoodie with the hood over his head. I asked him how he was doing, how his legs and knees felt. Fine, he said. We didn't ask him about whether he was going to continue the bet. The way he walked in and was searching for food, we knew he was going to keep running. He didn't seem unnerved… he just wanted pasta. It was almost scary how comfortable he seemed. His sister poured him a bowl of spaghetti, and he sat down at his computer desk to start eating.

As he ate, he pulled up some music on Youtube. It was a dubstep track. &ldquo;Have you guys heard this song?&rdquo; We told him we hadn't. &ldquo;Oh my god, it's so good.&rdquo; He started playing the music for us on the computer speakers as he ate. He bobbed his head to the beat, and soon started to air-drum on the desk. He ate his spaghetti that way, jamming to music he wanted to share with us. He still saw us as his friends, and in his silly way Ashton was still okay.

I remember looking at him carefully. I didn't dare to take my eyes away. The occupied expression on his face as he was clicking around on his computer, slurping that spaghetti. The bold white lettering on the hood of his hoodie, &ldquo;TO WRITE LOVE ON HER ARMS.&rdquo; The silence that we didn't dare interrupt, as though we were just waiting for him to speak again. A tired boy in a hood eating spaghetti at his desk. I remember thinking to myself very clearly: remember this sight, Haseeb. You will never forget this as long as you live. I said nothing. I just watched him. He ate slowly and unhurried.

<div class="center">♠</div>

When he finally finished eating, he talked to us some more as he sat there digesting. Joking and laughing…he barely even acknowledged the insanity of the situation he was in. I remember thinking, how can he be so energetic right now? He seems happy. Is he happy right now? I said very little.

At around 12:30, he went back upstairs. When he came down, he had changed into his shorts and marched out the door once again, his parents following quickly behind him. They hadn't said another word to us after our previous exchange. In the end, I thought to myself, they couldn't stop him either.

So the bet went on into the night.

<div class="center">♠</div>

Doug had been coming down with a cold all that day, and his cough was getting noticeably bad. I told him that he should get some sleep and drink lots of liquids. There was no point in him staying up if the parents are going to be watching Ashton all night. I'll make sure everything's all right, I told him. He agreed and went upstairs to get some much-needed sleep. I was sleepy too; I hadn't gotten much sleep the previous night and my exhaustion was building, but I felt like I needed to stay awake.

Ashton's sister and her boyfriend were in the living room with me. I told the sister, &ldquo;I just wanted to tell you, I'm really grateful that you guys are here. I don't know how we could've handled all this if you guys weren't helping us out.&rdquo; She smiled and said not to worry about it. She and her boyfriend just laughed and said it was typical for their family.

They weren't phased at all. They were giggling at each other's jokes and pulling up clips on Youtube… they seemed so comfortable in the midst of all of this madness, just living and making the most of things. I realized that I admired them. I remember telling Doug before he took his Nyquil and went to bed, &ldquo;Man… thank god for normal people.&rdquo; He grinned and agreed. &ldquo;Fuck the poker world,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;We need to learn to be more like them.&rdquo; Doug went upstairs to sleep and the two of them ended up falling asleep together under a blanket on the couch.

<div class="center">♠</div>

At around 1:30AM, I realized I was so exhausted that I needed to get some sleep. I went to my bedroom and set my alarm for 2:45AM, deciding that I was going to get up and sweat Ashton for the rest of run. I was just too tired, I could barely keep my eyes open and my mind just felt racked with exhaustion. It all felt like too much. I remember staring blankly at the ceiling. I wanted to push my anxiety down and just sink into the covers. It took me a while to fall asleep.

<div class="center">♠</div>

I scrambled to my feet and checked my phone. It was almost 5AM; I had missed my alarm. I must've been too tired and slept through it. Fuck, fuck. I threw my clothes on, shoved my feet into my shoes, and ran out the door toward the gym. I realized I had to piss along the way, so I went into a corner behind some hedges and relieved myself. It made me feel surprisingly relaxed…I felt like I'd be ready to face the scene before me. I walked around the side of the building, entered in the passcode to the gym, and opened the door.

His mother was sitting on the recumbent bike, tinkering with a game on her phone. His stepdad was standing near Ashton, his arm resting on an adjacent treadmill. He was watching a cartoon on the TV's that were suspended over the wall. Neither of them looked at me or even acknowledged my presence. I said nothing.

I walked over to the far side of the gym, and sat myself down on a weightlifting bench. I checked the time on my phone&mdash;it was 5:15 AM. I decided to myself I would stay the rest of the time and just watch him. I thought I would be able to.

I sat there blankly for some time as he was running, just feeling my brain slowly process everything. All I could hear was the mechanical whirr of the treadmill, and the pounding as his feet hit the tread. It was so perfect and continuous, like a metronome. I studied him carefully. He was stripped down only to his boxers. His skin seemed to be stretched taut over his musculature. His face was looking down and toward the left as he ran…his gait almost seemed like he was scurrying to catch up with the treadmill. His eyes were blank. I didn't know what he was looking at or thinking about. I remember thinking that he looked pitiful. Like a caged animal. I knew it was all in my head, but the longer I looked at him, the more my heart sunk. I felt so enormously guilty in that moment, I couldn't even look at him.

I pulled my iPod out of my pocket and put on my headphones. I thought maybe that would calm me down. I played some soft, mellow music. I looked at my shoes as I listened. I could still hear the whirring treadmill, the pounding of his feet over my music. I looked up at him, feeling a little more steady. I watched his legs as he ran… they seemed so stiff and tightened. I remember my gaze settling on his knees… I watched them carefully. They swayed back and forth, like fleshy pendulums. The longer I watched his knees… the more I started to see little glimpses in my mind of his legs slipping, of his pace slowing down, of his knees creaking to a stop. The image of his legs slowing down would persist for a moment, and then those pendulums would come back. And then I would see him tripping and falling on his stomach… and then the pendulums would come back. My heart started to beat faster. I was getting more and more anxious, and I could feel my stomach tensing up as I saw Ashton losing the bet again, and again, and again. Yet every time, those pendulums would come back. No matter what I felt, he kept running. I closed my eyes. Everything felt heavy in that moment. It was overwhelming.

I got to my feet. I felt like I was going to throw up. I hurried outside, slammed the &ldquo;Exit&rdquo; button to unlock the door, and stood over a hedge in the cold air. I had been in there only twenty minutes, but I couldn't take it. It was like I was face to face with my own insanity. The anxiety was too much.

I realized that I was imagining my friend truly getting hurt. It wasn't just an intellectual transaction anymore. I saw it with my very eyes. I thought to myself… What kind of a piece of shit am I that I'm thinking like this? What the fuck is wrong with me?

I walked back to the apartment, just trying to slow down my breathing, trying to settle down my flurried mind.

<div class="center">♠</div>

I called my friend, who woke up in the middle of the night to take my call. I was frantic, &ldquo;Fuck, I can't watch them. I can't. I'm going fucking crazy with anxiety just being in that room. I can't handle it.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Hey, hey. Haseeb. It's okay,&rdquo; she told me. &ldquo;Listen to me, it's okay. You don't need to be in that room. You need to just worry about you right now ok? Ashton's parents are in there worrying about him, he'll be fine. Focus on yourself. Just calm down, just breathe.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Fuck, fuck Rachel. What if he has a heart attack? What if he goes to the emergency room? How am I going to even know? His parents aren't going to tell me. I was sitting there on that fucking bench, imagining him falling over… what kind of a person does that make me? What kind of fucked up person am I that I'm imagining him getting hurt? What's wrong with me?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Listen, Haseeb. Nothing's wrong with you okay. This whole thing is just mad. He's a madman, and he's brought you into a mad situation, and it's making you go mad too. Nothing is wrong with you. Calm down, okay?&rdquo;

&ldquo;I don't know Rachel. I don't fucking know. It was like I was invisible in that room, his parents wouldn't even look at me. I feel like such a piece of shit. I wish I had never done any of this. I didn't think it'd ever turn out this way. I thought that it'd be over by now, that he'd have realized he couldn't do this. I didn't think I was doing anything wrong by taking this bet. I'm going to feel like a piece of shit even if I win, or if I lose. I don't know why I thought that I'd be okay with this.&rdquo;

Things went on that way for some time. Talking to her calmed me down some, but I still felt like there a riotous pain in my gut…something twisting and flopping around inside of my stomach, and it would climb up into my throat and choke me and then sink back down again. I felt like a wretch.

<div class="center">♠</div>

When I finally got off the phone with her I was less frantic, but the bet was still towering over me. The image of Ashton running in that gym kept seizing my thoughts. I tried to browse the internet and keep my mind occupied. It was 7AM. Time was slowing down to a crawl. He texted me his progress, and I measured it up&mdash;he had been running almost non-stop since midnight. At 78% of the time he had allotted, he had run 77% of the distance.

As time went on, I would feel more and more anxious. I had never felt an anxiety like that before in my life; it was suffocating. The longer I would be alone with my thoughts, the more it would possess me. I was looking at the clock twice every minute. Eventually I got so fucked up in the head, I had to call someone again. The cycle continued like that. Every moment I wasn't speaking to someone, it would start to feel like I was drowning in my own mind.

<div class="center">♠</div>

At around 8AM, I called someone who I hadn't spoken to about this bet before. Her name is Ursula. She's my best friend's mother. I met and got to know her over a week when she visited us about a year ago, but I had spoken to her only a couple times since. She is a small, skinny, worldly Polish woman who works as a healer. I remember my leg shaking uncontrollably, staring at her number in my phone. It was 6AM in Utah. My heart was beating. I felt guilty for calling her at this hour, but I dialed the number.

&ldquo;Hi? Who is this?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Ursula? Hi. It's Haseeb.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Oh… Haseeb… how are you sweetheart?&rdquo; she crooned in her slightly raspy voice. Even her voice sounded sagely to me. &ldquo;Are you ok?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Hey…hey…haha…well…no, I'm not okay,&rdquo; I sighed nervously. &ldquo;I got myself into something pretty crazy Ursula. I really fucked up bad and got myself into something I can't handle. I can't take being by myself right now. My thoughts are driving me crazy. I'm losing my mind, Ursula.&rdquo;

I proceeded to tell her all about the bet from the beginning. She murmured little yes's and oh my gosh's, and just followed along my story without interrupting me. I told her, &ldquo;I'm so sorry Ursula for waking you up. I'm so sorry, thank you so much for listening to me… I just really needed to tell someone all this.&rdquo;

She told me it was okay and tried to calm me down. She told me that I was one of the wisest and most mature young men she knew, and that she was surprised I had found myself in this situation. She told me that ultimately, this would be a great lesson in my life, and that Ashton would be an important teacher in my life as well, whether he knew it or not. &ldquo;What matters now most is whether you will learn the lesson that life is teaching you now, or if you need to be given this lesson again Haseeb. Ultimately, your challenge is going to be to see this through to the end, to acknowledge everything you're feeling, and then you must be able to forgive yourself. And once you can do that, and emerge from this without feeling like a victim, you'll be able to move on in your life, in your mind, and get back on the road you were meant to be on.&rdquo;

Then you must be able to forgive yourself. This phrase especially stuck with me. Even now, sitting here at my parents' home in Texas, it reverberates in my mind. I spent three days on the road alone in my car, wrestling with those words. I will never forget it.

I thanked her.

<div class="center">♠</div>

She had instructed me on a breathing exercise to do that would make me relax. I remember the mantra she told me to repeat:

&ldquo;I trust in the process of my life completely.&rdquo;

I had hung up the phone and was lying down on my bed trying to slow my breathing. Staring up at my ceiling, I calmly said aloud… &ldquo;I trust in the process of my life completely.&rdquo;

In that moment, some part of me became prepared to lose. I knew that I was supposed to lose the bet. That I was right to lose the bet. Because somewhere in all of this, there was a lesson that I needed to learn about myself, and about the world, and I had to accept that it was myself who brought me to this insane moment. 300k was going to hurt, a lot. When I made the bet originally, I realize that I wasn't really prepared mentally to lose 300k. I could handle it, I'd be okay&mdash;money can be made back. But ultimately money wasn't what really would affect me the most.

I thought about these things for a while. It was almost 9:00 AM. He had three hours left.

<div class="center">♠</div>

I woke up Doug, telling him that the bet was getting close to the end. Ashton's mileage had now pulled very slightly ahead of pace. It was going to be down to the wire whether he managed to finish. I told him I was losing my shit, and I just needed to talk to someone. He got his clothes on and we went to get some breakfast to calm our nerves.

As we were talking over breakfast, Ashton texted us. He had done 60 miles, and there were 3 hours left to go. He wrote &ldquo;I'm going to do 10 miles in 3 hours no problem. If you want to buy out now, you can for 200k. As a favor to you.&rdquo; Doug and I were surprised.

&ldquo;Man…there's no way I can take that buyout. To pay 85k to have a shot at a million dollars? I need less than 10% chance of winning to stay in. The last ten miles have to be the toughest. We knew that going in, that it would get exponentially more difficult the further he went on. Ashton has a point at which he can't run anymore, everyone does. He's never done this kind of endurance running before. The only question is whether his body will hit its limit at 69 miles or 71 miles. I can't take this buyout.&ldquo;

Doug agreed. We told him no. He asked if I was sure, if I really believed that this wasn't cake for him. I said I couldn't take that buyout. We didn't hear back from him.

Before we left the restaurant, I dropped $5 in a charity collection.

We drove home in silence.

<div class="center">♠</div>

By 10AM, Doug couldn't watch Ashton either. He said he couldn't handle it in there.

So we waited.

Time dragged slowly.

I was talking to people when I could to keep myself from exploding. But when I was telling my friends about what I was feeling, my tone had changed completely. I had felt like I had already lost. I felt like it was over. I was preparing myself. The number 285,000 would roll around in my head like a ball bearing.

Time was slow.

We waited.

<div class="center">♠</div>

It was almost noon, and we still hadn't heard from Ashton. I couldn't even contemplate anymore what was happening. My mind was starting to numb, and I just wanted it to be over with. I was ready to lose, and I didn't care anymore… I just wanted it to be over. The bet had begun at 12:30PM the previous day, and it was already 12:00PM. It was truly down to the wire.

I heard the door swing open.

I ran into the corridor at the head of the stairs. I didn't know what I expected to see. My heart felt like it was being held up by wire strings. In that first second that I saw the scene before me, I didn't understand.

Ashton was being helped up the stairs by his stepfather. He barely had the strength to pull his legs up. He was gripping onto the rail for support. &ldquo;Is he okay?&rdquo; They didn't answer me. In that moment, I didn't know.

When he finally got to the top of the stairs, he stepped into his room. He could walk. And then I knew.

It was over.

He had won.

<div class="center">♠</div>

I felt like I should be trying to help. It's not the time for me to worry about myself, I thought. I asked his mother how he was doing, what they were planning to do to help him recover, if they needed me to do anything. She told me that he was soaking in a tub of Epsom salt to help him recover. They said they were going to bring him food while he was soaking in there. He said he wanted pancakes. She was going to make him some.

I didn't know what to say. She told me then that they were going to take Ashton back to Ft. Lauderdale for a couple of days to let him recover. She said she would worry about him if he was here with us. It was then, the look that she gave me… as though I didn't belong there at all, that made it all start to sink into my skin. That's when it all started to hurt.

I asked again if they needed anything. She spoke to her husband. They ignored me.

I didn't know what to do anymore. I was exhausted. I went into my bedroom, texted a few people who were closely involved to tell them what happened, and sunk into my bed. I soon fell asleep.

<div class="center">♠</div>

The next couple of days were hard. I wasn't able to sleep well. I had strange dreams and would wake up after a couple hours. I dropped off Doug at the airport at 5AM the next morning, and from then on I was alone in the house. My mind felt heavy and sluggish.

I remember a friend of mine telling me &ldquo;Haseeb, this is going to fuck with your mind a lot. You've had a tough year, you walked away from poker after getting hacked, and now you put up all this money and lose what seems like an impossible bet. You're going to have a lot of digging to do, just to get your head in the right place again. That might be what sets you back the most, is just being able to believe in yourself again.&rdquo;

When I walked around the house, I could see the remnants of everything that happened. I saw bags on the floor full of used Gatorade bottles and power bars. Ashton's sweaty clothes still strewn across the floor. A half-open bottle of spaghetti sauce. When I saw that, for the first time it made me want to cry.

I decided I needed to leave. Ashton knew I had already planned to leave Orlando on the 14th, a week later. But I needed to leave now. I couldn't stay in that place anymore.

I didn't hate Ashton. I didn't blame him. Everything that I experienced, that I felt, and that I did fell squarely on my shoulders.

That afternoon, I started packing my things.

<div class="center">♠</div>

Everything that happened over those two days made me question a lot of things about my life and myself. I made the drive from Florida to Austin over three days, stopping only to eat, sleep, and write. Ultimately, like Ursula said, I need to understand what this tells me about who I really am. And then I need to be able to forgive myself for what I did.

I'd never lived with other poker players before. I've always been something of an outsider to the poker world&mdash;almost an interpreter you might say. I'd always been surrounded by normal people living their ordinary lives. Living with these guys has taught me a lot about myself, about who I want to really be, and how I want to live my life.

Something that I've come to think about is that perhaps there's something about the world of poker players that's fundamentally unhealthy. This generation of online poker players and its culture has existed for less than ten years, yet I've always had some assumption lodged deep in my psyche that if I'm not finding happiness through poker that it's just something wrong with me. And yet, there are so many people at every level of poker who are so deeply unhappy. It leaves me wondering.

And perhaps that's what really is the most difficult challenge for this generation of poker players. To infiltrate a world that is at its root, deeply unhealthy and imbalanced. To grab this bull called poker by its horns and to try to tame it for as long as we can. We hold on, and the bull bucks and tries to throw us into the droves of insanity around us. Some hold on, some don't. And maybe some are being dragged along the ground by this bull, and think they're still okay because they haven't let go. I remember writing over a year ago that as much as we learn about the game of poker, nobody really teaches us how to live as poker players. Nobody teaches us when we're supposed to let go of the bull.

In the end, I don't know the answers to any of these questions really. I've thought about a lot of things over the last few days and my mind is still scattered.

Losing 300k is painful. It will make me a little more anxious about money, but ultimately I'll be ok. I know that I need to put my mind and resolve back together so I can step back into the bullring. I'll have a lot of work to do to get back to the top of the game. My challenge now is to get myself back onto the head of this bull. And though I know it'll throw me off again someday, I know I have to ride it.

It's part of the process of my life.

<div class="center">♠</div>

As I was in the process of packing up my computer, to my surprise Ashton came through the door. He had already come back home the next day. I asked him how he was feeling, and he said he was feeling alright. His knees were hurting, but he was alright. He said he needed a shower. There was a Super Bowl party he wanted to go to that night.

&ldquo;We should talk,&rdquo; I told him. He nodded and went to have a shower.

I went outside and waited.

When he came outside, I was leaning against the car when he came up to me.

&ldquo;This whole thing was really screwed up,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;I didn't expect things to get out of hand like that.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I know. But it is what it is, and what's happened has happened.&rdquo; I looked at him carefully. He was looking off in the distance. It was windy. &ldquo;I didn't expect things to turn out the way they did either,&rdquo; I told him, &ldquo;but ultimately I need to take responsibility for what I did. You could've seriously have gotten hurt, and I don't know how I would've lived with myself if that had happened.&rdquo;

He told me that he knew his body; that he knew he wouldn't get hurt. He wasn't so stupid that he'd agree to something if he thought he could get hurt. &ldquo;That may be true,&rdquo; I told him, &ldquo;and you may have totally believed that. But we didn't. And that's what matters.&rdquo;

He considered this a moment, and nodded.

&ldquo;It was stupid to make this bet with you,&rdquo; Ashton said. &ldquo;I just hope it doesn't affect things between us.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Well, in the end nobody really won man. I felt like shit, Doug felt like shit, your parents felt like shit, and ultimately I know you feel like shit too, even after winning.&rdquo; He nodded. &ldquo;I need to figure out some things about myself and my life,&rdquo; I told him.

&ldquo;Are you leaving?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Yeah. Today.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Jesus.&rdquo;

He looked off in the distance again.

&ldquo;Before I go man,&rdquo; I told him, &ldquo;I need to tell you something. You're still my friend Ashton. Everything that happened was really fucked up, but everything that I'm feeling right now is on me. I still care about you, okay? And I don't hate you. Even though I need to leave, it's because of shit that I need to deal with on my own. And if you ever need any help man, you can call me any time. You got that?&rdquo;

He nodded. He reached out his hand to shake mine. I hugged him. &ldquo;It was good living with you,&rdquo; I told him.

He had to go. He asked me if I'd be here when he got back later tonight. I told him I wouldn't. I was glad that I spoke to him before I left. After he drove away, I went back inside and looked around at the house. I realized that I was almost sad to see it for the last time. I knew that it was the end of an important episode in my life.

I finished packing my car, took with me a couple of the power bars that Ashton had left uneaten, and started the drive home. They tasted awful.

title: Poker's Tragedy of the Commons
tags: [poker]

The poker community, momentarily breaking character, has been reflective lately. It all started with [Joe Hachem lamenting the decline of poker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DXSIv8b4KM) at the hands of new-school players. Phil Galfond then weighed in with his thoughts on [how to bridge the gap between new and old-school](http://www.runitonce.com/chatter/speaking-for-the-new-school/). Finally, [Daniel Negreanu went on 2p2]( http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/29/news-views-gossip/my-vision-poker-world-1417120/) to chide new-school players for not preserving the fun of the game; he imagines &ldquo;a world where players think about what's best for everyone first, understanding that in the end they will benefit from that as well.&rdquo;

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bTRsl5V4D_4">[video]</div>

These are all good and valid points. But for the most part, they are unlikely to lead to systemic change. The poker world undergoes such crises of conscience every so often, and this one doesn't seem substantively different. These points have all been made before. And in spite of the open conversation, all of the key parties (old-school, new-school, amateurs, poker sites, and media producers) are still motivated by the same incentives. Acknowledging that the system isn't working doesn't yet incentivize any particular group to change it.

Phil Galfond makes compelling points about how old-school players should be more welcoming and understanding of new-school players, and how media producers should work harder to differentiate the narratives of &ldquo;young genius&rdquo; players. These are wise recommendations, but on their own, they won't solve the problem. Indeed, Galfond, echoing Hachem, places the majority of the weight on the new generation to take the baton and rise to the occasion&mdash;be more entertaining! Make poker fun! Put down your headphones, come out from the hoodie, and give poker a more affable image!

One thing is for sure-the new-school players are the only ones who have the power to change the image of poker. Why? For one, old-school players are, clearly, a dwindling supply. Every new addition to the player pool is by almost by definition a new-school player or an amateur. The pool of old-school players is gradually dropping off, either due to unprofitability or age. Generally speaking, old-school players are much less adaptable, and poker has evolved rapidly in the last decade, leaving many of them in the dust. The narrative of &ldquo;new-school players posing a challenge to the old guard&rdquo; has become quaint and obsolete. We already know the ending. Of course new school players are better. They're winning all the damn tournaments and cleaning up all the cash games.

New-school players are representing a larger and larger portion of the poker populace. They're more malleable, more attuned to global conversations like the ones on 2p2, and hence are better able to uniformly respond to a cultural moment. The &ldquo;old-school&rdquo; is less coordinated, peppered throughout cardrooms and home games across the world. And Galfond is right, new-school players are more nerdy and introverted than old-school players. Poker no longer rewards animated, gregarious hustlers. Now, it breeds calculating tacticians. The type of personalities that succeed in today's poker are markedly different, and that matters. So what's holding the new-schoolers back from initiating Negreanu's cultural revolution?


## Staging the Tragedy

This is the simplest of all game theory dilemmas, known as [a tragedy of the commons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons). All poker players want the state of the games to get better. But the EV of each individual player is maximized by doing all the stuff they want&mdash;seating scripts, listening to their iPod, playing slow and methodically, whatever. Each poker player maximizing their own EV leads to the group's EV getting worse. This leads to overexploitation and the system on the whole degrading.

But this is particularly insidious in poker, because poker players are *trained* to be self-interested. It is continually impressed upon them&mdash;maximize your own bottom line, protect information, capitalize on every edge. Each player is expected to be the vigilant guardian of their own EV. And who can blame them? As games get tougher and tougher, every poker player is alone in fighting for their survival.

But as easy as it is to tell a large swath of players to get their act together, I don't think it's that simple. We shouldn't be misled by archetypes. When we say old-school, we immediately think of Doyle Brunson or Eli Elezra; when we say new-school, we think of Isildur1 or ElkY. When using this sort of token-logic, we're quick to admonish the entire group that they need to step up to the plate. But these pools are composed of many thousands of players, with varying levels of skill and security. It's easy to say to a newly-minted TV tournament star, &ldquo;hey, entertain the table more,&rdquo; but what can you say to the $5/$10 regular who's just barely eking out a living? Or the $10/$20 PLO player whose monthly swings dwarf his average EV? Is it really convincing to tell him, &ldquo;hey, take off those sunglasses and start joking around more, for the sake of all your brethren!&rdquo; In the end, we all know it's players like these who compose the vast majority of the poker world.

How can we reverse overexploitation? And perhaps just as importantly, when we do that, who is going to actually benefit?

Think about it for a second. What does it really mean that the &ldquo;state of poker&rdquo; will be better? Imagine you're an online 10/20 grinder, and your seating scripts are your only chance of landing you into good games. If you agree to give those up and return to the feast or famine free-for-all, who benefits? Well, a rising tide lifts all boats, right? But not yours&mdash;your ability to make a good living off 10/20 will likely seriously jeopardized. *Even if everyone gave up their seating scripts* and the state of poker marginally improved as a result, it probably won't be nearly by enough to offset the amount that you lost in giving up your scripts, because the majority of the benefit will be captured by the people who currently *aren't* using scripts. So, the state of poker isn't better for *you*, even if it gets better on average, because it's only gotten better for the people who aren't doing what you're doing.

Of course, to us as bystanders, the sacrifice sounds reasonable. It seems fair that non-script users should get a leveled playing field. But do the people who're using scripts feel they owe something to those who aren't? Why should they endanger their livelihood just to make things a little easier on other 10/20 regs? They're not going to get any of the benefits, unless poker *vastly* improves (which it won't). What should they care, and why should they be singled out to make that kind of sacrifice?

They've already found the optimal strategy, and now they're being asked to deviate from it in order to benefit other poker players. In no small sense, poker morality can't reasonably ask that of them. It's simply not part of the social contract they had to sign to be part of the poker community. It's understandable for us to get frustrated with how badly the games have now degraded, but to then suddenly act as though players owe us their edges, to demand an imaginary debt be called up&mdash;it doesn't seem like the right answer. It might be self-satisfying rhetoric, but I don't believe it's actually going to convince anyone to give up their scripts or stop taking time during hands.

It ignores the massive impasse that the poker community is really facing.

## The Warrior Culture

We all know that in the last few years, games have grown more scarce, edges smaller, and player pools tougher. I hear it from my clients all the time. Games don't run, the community is shriveling, and people are scared for their livelihood. Of course, this is not a recent trend&mdash;as poker has evolved, money has slowly evaporated. It's been happening continuously for the last ten years. This is nothing new.

But I do believe poker has become a fundamentally different experience. I don't envy those players who are trying to come up in the game now. I started poker soon after the passage of the UIGEA, which was one of the first major blows to online poker. I missed what many of my predecessors called the &ldquo;golden age.&rdquo; But even then, the poker that I stumbled upon was something more beautiful and engaging than what it is now.

When I speak with guys who built their careers playing cash games, I often hear a similar refrain&mdash;&rdquo;poker used to be so much fun.&rdquo; It really did! Poker used to be so exciting, so vigorous, back when I was grinding and moving up in stakes.

As a 6-max player, is there any sweeter challenge than struggling to move up from a $1/$2 to $2/$4, trying to outwit your table nemesis, trying to figure out how to exploit his tendencies? Or, after I became a heads up pro, playing long 4-table heads up matches against guys like Alcohol4Life, Gunning4You, Nemuii, coming back day after day to continue the battle, playing and playing just to see who'd come out on top? Back in those days, people fought for their egos. To sit down at someone's table was an affront. They would post and play you, just to see if they'd win. And, of course, they knew that even if they lost, they could always move down and build back up to wherever they were. Everyone was free in that way to play whomever they wanted. It was not money on the line, but hearts and minds.

It was a warrior culture. Poker was about the battle. It was about being the best, about stepping up onto that crest, at least for a moment. That poker was beautiful. And even more importantly, it was great goddamn fun.

Poker isn't like that anymore.

This is inevitable though. We all knew, even five years ago, that things would eventually get worse. As with all markets, the market of poker must move toward efficiency, and that's exactly what's happened. Edges and loose money have been captured by more and more grinders. 100NL games now are more solid than 600NL games were just five years ago.

And we also know that this is no one's fault. It's a predictable systemic progression. The change has not been due to cultural failings, but due to economics. As money tightens up, edges get smaller, time investments get larger, variance goes up, and ego becomes displaced by safety. There is nothing surprising in this. The unavoidable fact is that poker won't be as fun, enjoyable, or as inviting as it was in the past. The warrior culture won't be coming back.

I lost my love for poker a long time ago. But when I reminisce of that gladiatorial game that I fell in love with all those years ago, it doesn't make me want to play the game again. Because I know that what I loved about the game doesn't really exist anymore.

(Of course, this is reductive to an extent. Yes, people have bumhunted and games have formed around fish for a long time. And the most dramatic of the changes that I'm talking about mostly apply to heads up and high stakes economies; 6-max games still run consistently at lower stakes, and the step-ladder of poker remains intact there. But even if it's not as bad in most games, you still see some degradation across the entire span of poker.)

But I reminisce about all this not merely to be nostalgic, or pessimistic. True, I don't believe that this trend can be ultimately reversed. It might be mitigated by a large change like legalizing online poker in the US, but the march toward efficiency will nevertheless continue. It has to.

And yet, my point is not to say that poker is therefore doomed. My point is simply this: economics precedes culture, not the other way around. A prosperous poker economy create a strong culture that encourages play and competitive spirit. A scarce economy encourages self-interested behavior and greedy strategies. So villainizing those kinds of players in a scarce economy isn't an effective way of dealing with the status quo.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BYKM89FfvAM">[video]</div>

## Ending it All

There are only a few ways to resolve a tragedy of the commons: renewed resources, externally-imposed regulation, or cultural change. Renewed resources are not happening&mdash;the golden days of poker won't be coming back. So we have external regulation and cultural change.

External regulation, such as rules imposed by poker sites, are great for solving many tragedy of the commons situations. HUDs, grimming, and intentional time-wasting are good examples of problems largely solved by regulation. Once poker sites adopt new rules and shake up the incentive structure, they are able to incentivize the entire economy *against* overexploitation. The state of the game improves, while everybody is still doing what's now in their best interest.

Poker sites have enormous power in this equation, and it's clear that they need to be more proactive in orchestrating the poker economy so it doesn't degrade further. Seating scripts may be difficult for sites to detect on a software level, but surely there are telltale behavioral signs of script users (we all know what it looks like). If poker sites announced a week in advance that suspected script usage would start to lead to escalating temporary bans from sitting at any tables (1 day, then 3 days, then 7 days, etc.), or perhaps a simple 3rd strike permaban policy, and *especially* if they were tracking this behaviorally rather than through software, most script users would stop. Software is easy to get around. But if it were behavioral, nobody would really be sure what would be enough to tip off the poker sites. Pretty soon, most people wouldn't want to risk it.

Poker sites have already become more proactive in this role, introducing stuff like Zoom, anonymous tables, various &ldquo;amateur-friendly&rdquo; games, and so on. But clearly they need to go further, especially when it comes to the high-stakes games. Transparency and projecting an image of legitimacy is essential for online poker's well-being (and for being taken seriously when the inevitable fight over its legalization begins).

Externally-imposed regulation is a powerful force. But unfortunately, it has social limitations. It can't stop bumhunting; that's too socially murky. And of course, when it comes to live games or TV poker, brick and mortar poker rooms can't force you to be friendly, or not listen to headphones. Notably, some private games *do* force you to be friendly, by simply not inviting you back if you aren't. This is a splendid example of a tragedy of the commons being solved by external regulation&mdash;whoever's controlling the guest list controls the incentives. But I suspect that socially, we wouldn't be okay with brick-and-mortar poker rooms outright banning players who weren't very friendly.

If we want these behaviors to change, then we must acknowledge that externally-imposed regulation can't reach them. We have to create cultural change. And note, I don't say *hope* for cultural change, because simply hoping doesn't do anything. For significant cultural change this late in the game, it must be actively created, enacted, and pushed forward.

Cultural changes affect our direct moral and social incentives. For example, the environmentalism movement, which made green companies &ldquo;sexy,&rdquo; reshaped the cultural landscape and incentive structure. Companies that once couldn't give a shit about using recycled paper or sustainable energy sources, now have direct incentives from their customers. Could we do the same sort of thing in poker?

To make a cultural change in the poker world, we'd have to make it *not cool* that people discuss strategy at the tables. It'd have to become *taboo* to berate a fish. We'd have to *stigmatize* people who recede into their headphones and hoodies during poker sessions. There would need to be an orchestrated cultural push, starting from the movers and shakers (big-name players like Negreanu and Galfond), and trickling down into the foot-soldiers. But rather than being merely a lament, a cry of frustration, it would have to be an *announcement* of change. That the cultural landscape of poker had shifted. This announcement would have to be clear, coordinated, and unambiguous.

What if that did happen? What if there were specific, clear directives that people pledged to follow&mdash;&rdquo;the next time someone plays excessively slow, or the next time someone discusses strategy at the table, I am going to clearly and explicitly tell them off for making the game less fun.&rdquo; What if people anywhere, everywhere, in card rooms around the country, started actively talking about how to make their poker games more fun? What if this became the dominant conversation?

It's not a ground-breaking conclusion, certainly. But that, I think, is the best chance there is at making a real dent in these issues. Wherever poker sites can solve the problem by regulation and reshuffling incentives, we should leave it up to them. But where they cannot, it's up to the big name characters of poker to step up to the plate and help stimulate that cultural movement.

And for the sake of those who are now trying to come up in this game, I hope that it happens.

Hey gang,

Today (after a brief hiatus due to illness), I bring a new video where I explore the innumeracy bias. The central question I explore is this: are our minds naturally built to think in terms of probabilities and ratios? (They're not, it turns out.) And if not, then what, as poker players, can we do about it?

I am sitting on a porch, and next to me is an old man&mdash;grayed hair, sun-beaten skin&mdash;rocking back and forth in his chair. That man is me. That is, he's the old man I will one day be. He is looking off in the distance, smiling. Why is he smiling? Because he's lived a full life. I can't even imagine how much more he knows than I do. All of my youthful foolhardiness, the mistakes I'm going to make, the lessons that I have yet to learn&mdash;he knows them all, and they strike him as almost humorous. That must be why he's smiling, looking at me out of the corner of his eye. I have many questions for him.

But I don't get to ask him questions. I only get to listen.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OYhazrEYYW0">[video]</div>

This is a mental exercise I call &ldquo;words from the future.&rdquo; It's a powerful visualization that I sometimes do for my clients to help them re-align with their values. It's been fresh on my mind lately, and I wanted to share it with you guys. It's pretty simple. Here's how you do it. First, pull out something to write on.

Imagine yourself when you're 70. You've done lots of amazing things with your life by now. You've had an amazing career, maybe you've had a family, maybe you've won a great prize, discovered something. Whatever it is, it's been one hell of a life. You have many friends, and everyone respects you. But you're old now. And you're full of all the wisdom that this life has afforded you. Just imagine your future self, contented and full of wisdom, rocking back and forth on a chair.

See it? Okay. Now bring in your current self. As you are&mdash;youngish, curious, maybe a little lost or confused. You're sitting next to the old you. Maybe it's raining outside. But the old you is smiling. The old you is going to give you some advice. He's not going to tell you everything, of course. Just the little nuggets that are going to help you get on the right path. You get to take this with you&mdash;a little cheat sheet for the rest of your life.

What are they? Think about it. Imagine it. You know what they are.

Write them down.

Keep them.

Here are mine. I've had them taped to the front of my door so I can remind myself of them every time I head out in the morning:

### Words from the Future

**Everybody has something to teach you.**

**Never lie about who you are.**

**Write without thinking.**

**Stop wasting your time with chicken-headed girls (or guys).**

**You have nothing at all to be afraid of.**

**Think of your family often.**

**The path is paved only by doing, doing, doing.**

**You will be loved.**

**You are capable of greatness, but you are not yet great.**

Those are mine. What are yours? Take five minutes. You don't have to share them with anyone, but really try it. I find this exercise is a powerful way to tap into your own wisdom. You might discover something you didn't expect to realize. (Weird update, I know, but I really felt like sharing this. It's been pretty powerful for me.)

Give it a try,

2014-04-26-the-dog-of-athens.md
title: The Dog of Athens
tags: [personal]
image: diogenes_ukigua.jpg
---

Diogenes of Sinope was the father of Cynicism, an ancient school of ascetic philosophy. It's easy to talk abstractly though. I like to imagine him: tattered clothes, tangled beard, a scraggly old man. In Athens, Diogenes was known unaffectionately as &ldquo;the Dog.&rdquo; He lived in a discarded wine tub, which he kept out in the marketplace. He possessed nothing more than his staff and cloak. He once had a wooden bowl, but upon seeing a child drink out of his hands, he discarded the bowl as an un-necessity. He was infamous for his disregard of social custom&mdash;he would masturbate in public, he would spit on rich men. He would even eat his meals in the Athenian marketplace (which was apparently a faux pas of egregious proportions). And yet, he was a man of wide and considerable repute. Of his legendary meeting with Alexander the Great in Corinth, Plutarch wrote:

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2msYDr0x2OA">[video]</div>

> Thereupon many statesmen and philosophers came to Alexander with their congratulations, and he expected that Diogenes of Sinope also, who was tarrying in Corinth, would do likewise. But since that philosopher took not the slightest notice of Alexander, and continued to enjoy his leisure in the suburb Craneion, Alexander went in person to see him; and he found him lying in the sun. Diogenes raised himself up a little when he saw so many people coming towards him, and fixed his eyes upon Alexander. And when that monarch addressed him with greetings, and asked if he wanted anything, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Diogenes, &ldquo;stand a little out of my sun.&rdquo; It is said that Alexander was so struck by this, and admired so much the haughtiness and grandeur of the man who had nothing but scorn for him, that he said to his followers, who were laughing and jesting about the philosopher as they went away, &ldquo;But truly, if I were not Alexander, I would be Diogenes.&rdquo;
>
> <div class="source">Plutarch</div>

For my own part, I've always admired Diogenes and the Cynics. Not that I imagine I'm following their philosophy. Their extreme asceticism demands far more balls than are in my possession. But I suppose it pleases me to know that men once lived who could reject the standards of society, and had the courage to live by it.

It's been over four months now since giving away my money and starting over. The first thing I've realized is that even $10,000 affords me more freedom than most people have. I've been living cheaply, continuing to save and nurturing a small nest egg underneath me (in case I run into anything catastrophic, hopefully it will inure me from going into debt). And yet, there is little I feel I don't have.

I've been eating at the same cheap cafeteria almost every day for lunch, cutting most of my other eating-out expenses. I usually only eat two big meals a day now, which saves on money (and time). I've been cooking lots of omelets for dinner. My mother's been teaching me how to make other meals, but they're works in progress.

How else has my life changed? When I wanted to write, I used to go to the UT Law Library. I'd often take naps on their couches. But that requires paying for city parking&mdash;up to $5 a day. So I've started going to the public library instead; I take my naps at home. Really, now that I think about it, the changes in my life haven't been dramatic. I suppose I've been paring down my life in simplicity ever since I came home from Europe. I eat out less often, and I spend less money on stuff I don't need. But most of the changes have been mental ons.

Admittedly, there are some expenses on which I won't skimp&mdash;an exercise regimen, eating healthy food, stuff like that. The things I need to remain centered. But beyond that, not a lot strikes me as that important.

Even when I was a poker player, I always had a fondness for living simply. Every time I'd pack up my belongings, seeing them pared down to a couple bags in the back of my car&mdash;it was a good feeling. A kind of relief, really. It was a reminder that my life was small and unimportant&mdash;that it was supposed to be. When I'd drive cross-country (others would usually fly), I'd never get motels at night, instead I'd sleep in my car along the highway. I invested most of my money. I never bought much into extravagance. Even if I wanted to, I suspect I wouldn't know what to do with the money. Excess is just a silly thing to me. Even money, at times, feels like numbers on a far away field.

Now, writing a memoir and mind coaching, eating healthy and working out a lot, volunteering and spending time with friends, I'm enjoying the process of my life. I don't know if I'll ever become rich again. If I do though, things will probably be different. I imagine I'll probably be more measured in how I spend and invest it. I'll appreciate it a lot more, I imagine. But I think, most of all, I'll be better at putting it to good use&mdash;not just for myself, but for others.

Hey guys,

For the next *two days*, I'm going to be accepting applications for public coaching sessions. If you're interested, here's how it works:

[Note: the window for this has now passed. I'll be posting a follow-up very soon!]

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2cjLoO97elo">[video]</div>

* Write in an application (subject: Application), and just tell me a little bit about what games you're playing and what you suspect your mental weaknesses are.

* I'll accept (probably) three coaching clients. If you're accepted, we'll chat a little beforehand, and then record a 50~ min coaching session where we'll try to diagnose and work through your primary issues. Then, a week later, we'll do a short 15~20 minute followup to track the progress you've made.

* As an added bonus incentive, if you write within the next two days (that is, until 5/15/2014), then I'll send you a **free copy of my audiobook** as well (**$17.95** on [Amazon/Audible](http://www.amazon.com/How-Be-Poker-Player-Philosophy/dp/B00IJHYGOM/ref=tmm_aud_title_0)), just for writing in! Just mention in your e-mail whether you'd like the audiobook (since I know many of you already have it), and for those who want it, I'll ship it your way. :)

* The coaching audio will get thrown up on my website, so that other people who're potentially interested in coaching can get an idea of what it's like. If that sounds like a decent tradeoff for free coaching, then go ahead and write in! If you're going through a downswing or have wanted to get a jump-start improvement on some of your tilt, motivation, focus, or anger issues as a poker player, I encourage you to send one in. :)

So there you go! [You can contact me here, as always.](http://www.haseebq.com/connect/) Just make the subject: &ldquo;Application.&rdquo;

I'll update this once the window for applications is closed. Hopefully the results will be pretty cool once I put them up! You might learn a thing or two about how to solve your own tilt/motivation problems. Look forward to it! :)

[Note: you can't get a free audiobook or apply for this anymore. But I feel like I owe you something&hellip;so please accept this funny video as recompense.]

Hey guys,

So the applications came in, and I selected a few people for the public coaching sessions. Thanks to everyone who wrote in! I have a few big names in store for the public coaching. It's going to be exciting, so stay tuned.

I'm going to be posting the coaching sessions one at a time. You're likely to pick up a lot of the techniques and resources I use with many of my clients to deal with common issues, such as tilt, anxiety, motivation, etc., as well as hear their interesting stories. Today we're starting with the first candidate, a very awesome guy by the name of **Scott C.**

Scott is a live $2/$5 grinder who wrote in telling me that he was going through a rough downswing. It'd been affecting his confidence, causing him to tilt, and making him dread coming to the tables. I listened to his story, diagnosed the problems, and came up with a step-by-step plan to start resolving his issues.

This session focuses a lot on **tilt**, **motivation to play**, and **confidence**. Give it a listen. ([External link here.](http://yourlisten.com/HaseebQ/scott-c-initial-session))

Hey guys,

Have had a number of people tell me they got a lot out of hearing the [first coaching session](https://haseebq.com/public-coaching-session-scott-c/) I did with Scott C. Well today I finished my first session with the second candidate, a grinder from Belarus named **Yaroslav**.

Yaroslav is an online HU $200NL-$1000NL grinder who wrote in telling me that he had a lot of anger and tilt issues. He said he was a pretty emotional person in his general life, but wanted to learn how to control those emotions in poker. He'd broken mouses, keyboards, and mugs in outbursts of anger.

This session focuses on **anger**, **hot tilt**, **relaxation exercises**, **making mistakes**, and **how to optimize learning**. Give it a listen. ([External link here](http://yourlisten.com/HaseebQ/yaroslov-initial-session).)

Strap in, because it's time for coaching session #3.

**João** is an MTT grinder whose average tourney buyin is around $150. He's a strong player online, and even took 2nd in several of this year's SCOOP events, but his primary issues were in live poker–particularly, he wanted to make the transition to playing more live tourneys. His challenges were that he got bored easily, would get anxious when his stack fluctuated, and seem to make significantly worse decisions in live games in live games.

This session deals primarily with **boredom**, **transitioning to live games**, and **dealing with anxiety**. Give it a listen. ([External link here](http://yourlisten.com/HaseebQ/joao-initial-session).)

So it's time for the three-week followups. If you're just joining us in our program, I'll get you caught up. A few weeks ago I did a drawing for free public coaching sessions, and posted them publicly. Now, three weeks later, I'm following up with them to see if their poker games have improved, and what we can do to sustain positive changes going forward.

Well, I recently finished the last followups, and to say the least, I was completely blown away. If you were wondering how Scott, Yaro, and João did after their coaching sessions, you might be surprised to see how drastic the changes were!


### ♠

**[Scott C](https://haseebq.com/public-coaching-session-scott-c/)** was $2/$5 grinder who was struggling with motivation to play, tilt, and confidence problems. In the 3-week followup, he claims some pretty amazing life changes–you have to listen to believe it. Direct link is [here](http://yourlisten.com/HaseebQ/scott-c-followup).

**[Yaroslav](https://haseebq.com/public-coaching-session-yaroslav/)** was a $200NL-$1kNL HU grinder who was struggling with rampant emotional problems. He had angry outbursts, tilted easily, and was unable to forgive his own mistakes. In this followup, he admits that he used to believe that all of these were simply part of his personality, but now he's realized otherwise–in fact, he claims he feels like he's already felt huge changes.

All in all, I'm really happy with how all of these guys ended up, and I wish them nothing but the best in the future. I was lucky to have chosen three people who were as dedicated and steadfast as these three–they all have strong potential as poker players. Who knows, you might be hearing a lot more of their names in the near future. :)

You might be wondering what's wrong with these people. Do they have ADHD? Alzheimers? Some obscure degenerative disease? In fact, what they have in common is that they're online multitabling regulars, and their stories provide a chilling glimpse into the murky horizon that awaits many poker players.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JlSsbNc0_u0">[video]</div>

How common are these stories? I first started hearing accounts of it when I was a poker player. I'd even experienced some of it myself. When Pokerstars raised the multitabling limits back in 2007, 12-tabling 6-max games quickly became my bread-and-butter. Before long, playing just four tables would bore me; I didn't have the patience for it. After enough time, reading a book or sitting through a two hour documentary seemed like an ordeal. I'd browse Youtube videos while chatting on Skype and reading poker forums. My brain was continually being fed high-octane stimuli, and when it wasn't, I had trouble focusing.

After quitting poker three years ago, a lot of that had gone away. I'd largely forgotten about it. But when I saw a few threads on TwoPlusTwo with people sharing their stories, it sent me down a rabbit hole of investigation.

## Your Brain on Multitabling

It's impossible to know exactly what poker does to the brain. Poker as it's being played now, multitabled for 500+ hands per hour, is a new and strange phenomenon. There's really never been anything like it. It's been around for less than ten years&mdash;too recent for us to observe its long-term effects. And the scientists who study online gambling are more interested in its effects on addicts and laypeople than its effects on professionals.

We have some anecdotes, but anecdotes don't tell us enough. We don't have a clear picture of what percentage of multitablers this happens to. We assume that online poker is the cause of this, but the causation could be more complex than that. We don't know if these people are simply predisposed toward attentional problems, and perhaps that's what caused them to became multitablers in the first place. Or their problems might be caused by some third independent factor, such as Internet addiction. There are too many confounding variables, so we have to get at the question another way.

## The Price of Multitasking

Picture a 24-tabling regular, staring at two 30&rdquo; monitors peppered with MTTs and sit-and-gos. Decisions pop in front of him and then recede into the background with frenetic speed. He's mentally jumping again and again into different situations, clicking rapidly from game to game.

By constantly switching his mental context, he incurs what neuroscientists call [switching costs](https://www.apa.org/research/action/multitask.aspx). &ldquo;Every time we shift our attention, the brain has to reorient itself, further taxing our mental resources,&rdquo; writes Nicholas Carr. &ldquo;Many studies have shown that switching between just two tasks can add substantially to our cognitive load.&rdquo;

Through switching costs, multitasking almost always decreases our efficiency at any given task. That doesn't come as much of a surprise. But what about for someone who's multitasking day-in and day-out? If you're always multitasking, does that make you more efficient at it? An infamous [2009 Stanford study](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/08/21/0903620106.full.pdf+html) looked at exactly this.

The study compared heavy technology multitaskers against light multitaskers. They expected the multitaskers to outperform the non-multitaskers, but what they found was the exact opposite. The heavy multitaskers were less able to ignore distractions, had worse focus, short-term memory, and were poorer at context switching. According to one of the researchers, the heavy multitaskers were &ldquo;suckers for irrelevancy.&rdquo; &ldquo;Everything distracts them.&rdquo; Notably, these symptoms are similar to what we observed in chronic multitablers.

Usually, the brain adapts to become better at commonly repeated tasks or stimuli. But it seems in this case, the brain's response is maladaptive. Constant multitasking made people's brains *worse* at it. Why?

## The Perils of Overstimulation

Perhaps the high rate of information processing puts so much load on the brain that it weakens other faculties, such as working memory or attention control. It's not implausible. Studies have shown that overstimulation leads to [significant impairments in cognitive function for mice](http://www.nature.com/srep/2012/120731/srep00546/full/srep00546.html). Maybe this is something similar&mdash;perhaps poker players are getting overstimulated, and it's affecting their brainpower.

![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Human_brain.png)

But on the other hand, there are reasons to believe that some multitasking has positive effects on the brain. Studies have shown that complex computer tasks like Internet browsing are powerful mental exercise, and have positive effects on patients with cognitive decline. [One study](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0070350) even introduced non-gamers to Starcraft, the real-time strategy game, and found a significant boost in their cognitive flexibility after a few months. These studies seem to indicate that some amount of multitasking is valuable mental stimulation. So when does brain training become brain overload?

It's hard to say. What's clear is that these multitablers have crossed the threshold into unhealthy multitasking. And chances are, that's not the sole cause of their cognitive impairment. Internet addiction similarly causes impairment of executive control and irritability. According to one study by the University of Melbourne, about 10% of students have Internet addiction. Judging from the accounts given by multitablers, it's likely that massive multitabling and Internet addiction are occuring together and are mutually reinforcing.

## A Trigger-happy Brain

But perhaps the &ldquo;overstimulation&rdquo; model doesn't tell the whole story. After all, it's hard to believe that the brain isn't able to adapt positively to multitasking when it's able to adapt to almost everything else. What if we assume that the brain is adapting positively, but only within a narrow band of behavior? After all, people clearly get better at multitabling over time. The progression is well-known: you have to 9-table before you can 12-table before you can 16-table.

Perhaps the problem is that the multitabler has trained his brain for constant, hair-trigger context switches. By spending so much time in the trenches of multitabling, his brain has become trigger-happy when it comes to switching. This causes many automatic, unwanted context switches. And what's another word for an unwanted context switch? Distraction, of course. In that case, it's no wonder that massive multitablers can't focus. They spend all their time adapting their brain to constant switching, so even if they try to slow down and focus, their brain is still primed to switch at a moment's notice.

Perhaps this best explains these effects on the brain. Or perhaps both this trigger-readiness and overstimulation are to blame. Or perhaps it's something else altogether. So far, we don't know. But either way, it's hard to question that massive multitabling is harmful to our brains.

Dusty &ldquo;Leatherass9&rdquo; Schmidt concluded in his [infamous blog post](http://www.cardplayer.com/poker-blogs/51-dusty-leatherass-schmidt/entries/561296-this-is-my-brain-on-poker) that quitting poker was the only option left to him. But that doesn't mean that all multitablers need take such drastic steps. In fact, a lot of research suggests that there are some ways to buffer against these ailments. In part 2 of this article I'll explore what you can do to inoculate yourself and multitable sustainably&mdash;if I ever write it (I suck, I know).

Until then,

title: Why I've Decided to Devote my Career to Earning-to-Give
tags: [effective altruism, personal]
image: EA-Logo-redbg_jgue88.png
---

It's been almost four years now since I retired from professional poker. I haven't played a single hand of poker since then. I've written a lot about poker, I've coached a lot of poker players, but the game itself is long behind me.

So what comes next?

Ever since I quit, that question has hung over me. What do I do with my life? As a poker player it was an easy question: just get better. For a poker player, that means either make more money, or beat stronger opponents. Both are tangible, irrefutable metrics.

I'm not a poker player anymore. But I've realized that no matter how things change, self-mastery is still my life's goal. Perhaps that's why I was so drawn to poker when I was.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j0DvjgagJko">[video]</div>

As I've matured, the meaning of self-mastery changed for me too. To me, self-mastery means mental, physical, and spiritual excellence. It also means ethical excellence. So over the last few years, I've been working to cultivate virtue as best I can. I've been physically training myself through kickboxing, weightlifting, dieting and fasting. I've been mentally and spiritually training myself through minimalism, self-discipline, and meditation. I've volunteered as a dishwasher and done construction work, tutored refugees in English, and over the last year I've volunteered on a domestic violence hotline and been a hospital advocate for sexual assault victims.

I wasn't a poker player because I enjoyed it. In the same way, I don't do these things because I enjoy them either. I do them because I want to move me closer to the kind of person I want to be. It's a struggle that I hope I never abandon.

So what about my career?

I've been kicking around that question for a long time. There's a lot I could do, but what would be the most valuable? For a while I was exploring law school, organizational psychology, and most recently an MBA. But in the past couple months, I've stumbled upon the thing that I know I need to do. And it's altered the course of my life.

**I've decided to become a web developer so that I can earn-to-give.**

## What's Earning-to-give?

It was a few years ago that I first came across the writings of a movement called [Effective Altruism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism). At its simplest, Effective Altruism boils down to one big idea: be altruistic in a way that's rigorous and based on evidence. Rather than simply following your gut or &ldquo;doing what feels right,&rdquo; EA demands that you think seriously about the best ways to improve the world, and to implement those solutions in a rigorous way, no matter how uncomfortable or demanding it might be.

It's more than just thinking about how to do good. It's thinking about how to do *as much good as possible*. And earning-to-give, which came out of Effective Altruism, is one such strategy.

Earning-to-give simply means pursuing a successful career so that you can donate the money you make to the most cost-effective charities. Where some think the best way to help the world is by directly adding their labor (i.e., entering the non-profit job market), someone who earns-to-give thinks they can help even more by earning money in the private sector and donating that money to charitable causes.

That's what I'm going to do. **I'm going to donate 33% of my income for as long as I possibly can. And once I have some savings, I'll raise that number to 50%.**

It sounds outlandish, I know. And on the rare occasion that I confess to someone my plan to do this, their next question is inevitably:

## Why?

It's funny. I was 19 when I first became a millionaire. I had more money than any adolescent ever should. And I had no idea what to do with it. All the insipid little contests poker players would get into on who made more, who was going to retire first, who had a bigger watch, car, house, they held no appeal to me. Money and luxury seemed empty.

In many ways, I'm happier having left it behind.

So why was I so drawn to poker, a game quintessentially about greed? I think it's because I loved the challenge. I wanted to prove myself. I wanted to get better, and to know that I was good.

I still want that. I think self-challenge is a fundamental part of my soul. But I also want to help people as much as I can. And earning-to-give is a way for me to do all of that&mdash;to challenge myself, to develop my skills, while still living an authentic and ethical life. To help people, to change the world, while still mastering myself as a human being.

I don't want to become rich. I don't want to retire young. I want to fight all of my life for the things I care about, and to become a better person for it.

So that's why I'm earning-to-give.

I decided all of this a long time ago, but it's only recently that I've taken the first steps. I'm flying out to San Francisco this Wednesday, and I'll be embarking on my new career path as a web developer. It's a scary, frantic, and exciting time. And it feels like exactly what I should be doing.

**So why web development?** I'm going to explain that in my [next blog post](https://haseebq.com/why-im-becoming-a-web-developer/). For now I need to sleep. I have a lot of preparations I need to make and people I need to say goodbye to.

I'll be writing again soon.

<p class="note">Edit1: someone asked me why I decided to write all this publicly. Two reasons: one, that I believe it's valuable to do this visibly, so that I can potentially influence others to become interested in Effective Altruism and earning-to-give. Second, to hold myself accountable. By publicly tying my hand, I make it harder to go back on this.</p>

<p class="note">I'm committed now.</p>

<p class="note">Edit2: a quote I read earlier today that struck me.</p>

> However many holy words you read, however many you speak, what good will they do you if you do not act on upon them?
> <div class="source">Dhammapada</div>

A new stage in my life began four days ago. I got out of a taxi on 7th and Market Street, with all of my belongings stuffed into a backpack and one suitcase. To my left, homeless men were peddling their wares and accosting passersby, and on my right, I could see the dizzying buildings packed with San Francisco's most promising startups.

I've never lived in a city like this before. Not like San Francisco. I'm frantically trying to figure out this city and the tech industry. To put it simply, I'm lost and excited.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lv0vRHid5cw/">[video]</div>

## How I Got Here

I've known for a while that I wanted to move to the Bay and [earn-to-give](https://80000hours.org/earning-to-give/). So a few months ago, when I got an offer from a good friend of mine to do &ldquo;growth hacking&rdquo; in a few months for an early stage startup in the Bay, I was really interested. Marketing wasn't what I was ultimately passionate about, but it would be a fantastic opportunity to break into the industry and work with some amazing people.

Wanting to brush up my skills (marketing for startups requires lots of technical stuff), I began teaching myself some basic coding: HTML/CSS, Javascript, R.

Much to my surprise, I enjoyed it. A lot. Not only did I enjoy it, but I was good at it. I picked up ideas quickly, relentlessly attacked problems, and reveled in the myopic flow of tinkering and problem-solving. In a way, it reminded me of what I used to enjoy most about poker.

It began to dawn on me that: hey, if I became a coder, I could go into the tech world from the development side. Rather than market things, I could build them myself. And if I wanted to eventually go into entrepreneurship and found my own company, then I could build that product myself. Even from the financial side, as a coder, I could earn-to-give more quickly (since marketing for a startup doesn't pay a whole lot). It all seemed to make perfect sense. Except for one thing: I was 25 and had hardly done any coding in my life. How was I going to get good enough to actually get a job, much less in the technology capital of the world?

## Coding Bootcamps

I began researching coding bootcamps. Coding bootcamps are a new and revolutionary model in technology education. [Bootcamps.in](http://www.bootcamps.in/) describes them as &ldquo;full time coding schools designed to train students without programming skills … by providing highly focused, accelerated learning programs.&rdquo; Coding bootcamps are extremely structured full-time programs that last around 3 months, and teach students how to code from top to bottom. In the span of just a few months, many learn enough to be competitive with graduates from major CS programs. In other words, it's the hack into quickly becoming a hacker.

I got my hustle on. I made a list of all the best coding bootcamps in the Bay (other than HackReactor, since their start dates were too far away), and applied to every single one of them to start as soon as possible. The next week was a sleepless flurry of teaching myself Ruby and Javascript so that I'd be able to pass these technical interviews. For a week straight, I barely left my room. Code was all I saw and breathed. That might sound awful, but I felt ecstatic. I loved it.

Ten days later, I had five acceptances in hand, including an acceptance at my goal school: [App Academy](http://www.appacademy.io). Alongside HackReactor, it's considered the best coding bootcamp in the world. Their program is 12 weeks of 70+ hours of non-stop coding. It has a 3% acceptance rate, 98% employment, no tuition up front, and an average starting salary in the Bay of 105k. Once I got the call, I celebrated, re-oriented, said goodbye to my old friends and prepared to move to SF.

So that's how I got here. I'm going to become a web developer. Not forever, certainly. But for now, this is what's next.

I'm really f**king excited.

So people have asked me: why web development? Surely there are better ways to make money. I could go back into poker, or go into finance, or even get an MBA.

Those are all reasonable choices, I agree. But I think ultimately, web development is the right choice for me, and I'm going to explain why.

## Why Web Development?

First and foremost, I know that I want to work in the tech industry and in the Bay Area. The culture, the weather, and the ethos of this place have always appealed to me, and have drawn me for most of my life toward that direction. I always knew I'd eventually come here. And who knows if I'll stay, but I know this place is going to be a part of my life.

Second, learning to code is an invaluable skill in and of itself. By getting into this industry I'll be able to survey and understand the landscape of both business and entrepreneurship much better. As a coder, I'll be in a prime position to move in any direction once a promising opportunity presents itself, whether that's working for a tech company, a startup, or an orthogonal industry entirely. It is, in that sense, an extremely versatile credential. Not only that, but it's one I can cash in immediately, unlike one that requires a graduate degree.

I know I'll never be the best computer scientist in the world. That's fine; it's not my goal. I have other advantages that I can leverage in the long run, but I'm going to find opportunities to do that by making my way into the industry.

Third, I find coding very intellectually engaging in a way that I don't marketing, business, or finance. That's no mark against those fields&mdash;each one is complex in its own right. They're just not fields I can get immediately passionate about, and nor are they fields that I can easily penetrate with my hodgepodge credentials. In that sense, coding is supremely meritocratic. Either you can code or you can't, and in the Bay, abilities go a lot further than certifications. I've always appreciated that about poker, and I appreciate that about coding.

Four, going into coding will allow me to earn-to-give immediately, connect with other effective altruists who are in tech, and potentially influence others to get into EA and earn-to-give themselves. Tech seems to attract an ideal profile&mdash;thoughtful nerds who don't have much use for all the money they're making. If I can come out here and do some movement-building for Effective Altruism and earning-to-give, it could lead to an amazing impact. I suspect I could do a lot more here than I could in finance, and certainly more than in being a poker player.

And finally, as a web developer, I'll be able to build shit! It's cool. It's fun. It's an exciting and amazing skill, and one in a market that is (short-term prognoses aside), likely to remain robust, if not grow even bigger. Coding and working with data are skills that will be increasing necessities as our internet-driven society evolves. I'm excited to get involved in that, and bite off a small piece of this giant pie.

And why not poker? Because I made a promise to myself to move on with my life, and that's what I've done. And while maybe I might be able to make money in poker in the short-term, I think in the long-term, this will be a much better investment. And just as importantly, I'll be a lot happier.

So.

To that end, this blog will be changing. I'll still write sometimes about poker, but much of my focus is going to be shifting toward technology, entrepreneurship, and effective altruism. Over time, I'll update the design of the blog to reflect that transition. But for now, I've gotta put my head into the game and focus on coding.

My first class of App Academy starts tomorrow morning. It's 70+ hours of non-stop work for the next few months, so I have a torrent of work ahead of me. Time to start swimming.

It's been two weeks now since I began the coding bootcamp at App Academy. The material has been blasted at us at a breakneck pace, and I've been learning a ton. Among the things I've learned: what &ldquo;90 hours a week&rdquo; feels like. The past 5 days, I've been at App Academy from 10AM till midnight, every single day.

It's strange; it feels like just a few days ago that I first posted that I was going to move out here. But we're already beginning week 3 of the academy. It's all a flurry of building programs and trying not to under-sleep. That said, I've gained more confidence in my abilities as a coder. I'm starting to suspect I really have some potential for this.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5bJ0ldayP24/">[video]</div>

I'm still an acolyte coder. Hell, I'll still be an acolyte when I make it out of this program in 10 weeks. Coding is a mountain, and I'm standing at its base. Even with all this I'll have barely climbed one step. But I like that. That's exhilarating place to be for me.

Almost everyone I meet in San Francisco has some background in tech. And that means almost everyone I meet is further than I am. Everybody has something to teach me. It's an amazing feeling. For most of my life as a poker player, I was the &ldquo;master.&rdquo; For every person I looked up to, there were 100 people looking up to me. It was my job to give answers rather than to find them.

But in coding, it's the other way around. I am a student among students. Almost everybody knows more than I do. The impulse to learn, to get better, is irresistible. There's something absolutely ecstatic about that.

I'm going to keep trying to update this blog, but while I'm at App Academy, most of my writing will probably be constrained to my coding blog I've made. You should read it: I write about my progress through App Academy, talk about the challenges I'm facing, and show the programs I've made.

Everything I've done so far has been pure Ruby (meaning, command-line programs), but they include fully-functioning Tic-Tac-Toe, Hangman, all the way up to Chess, Checkers, and currently working on five-card draw poker! Follow me if you want to ride side-car on my coding adventures.

#### You can find my coding blog here: [http://haseebwritescode.com](http://haseebwritescode.com)

(Don't worry if you're not technical, I'm going to continually do my best to explain things so that they're easy to understand. And you'll probably learn a few cool things along the way!)

Sincerely trying to get enough sleep,

It's officially official.

At week 8 into my 12 week coding bootcamp, I was whisked into a room with Ned Ruggeri, the co-founder of App Academy. He sat me down and told me that I was the top student in my cohort (40~ students), and asked that I come on as an instructor and help teach the bootcamp. With the position comes a competitive package, the opportunity to teach others what I've learned, strengthen my skills as a coder, and the potential to develop future App Academy computer science curriculum.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j1hWXU7vs9Q/">[video]</div>

I accepted the position. I'll be starting in a week and a half, effectively skipping the last 1/4th of the program to begin teaching. I'm really looking forward to this, since I really enjoy teaching, and I've grown increasingly confident in my skills as a coder over the course of this program. If anybody is interested in going down this same route or interested in attending App Academy, I encourage you to contact me! I'd be happy to chat about my experiences. And having gone through (most) of it, I can only endorse App Academy as having a *stellar* curriculum, and being eminently worth the time and monetary investment.

I negotiated a four-and-a-half month contract, after which I'll decide whether I want to stay and continue to work with App Academy, or seek other employment in the tech world. It's going to be an exciting and busy time for me. In a way, it'll also be my first real-actual-job.

Haha, it's not *really* my first job; I've been working in one sense or another since I was probably 17 years old. I just kind of like that idea.

This also means that I'll begin earning-to-give and getting more involved in Effective Altruism. It's funny, hah. That was exactly my plan: through App Academy, I'd be able to earn-to-give almost immediately. I didn't expect that to happen before the program even ended. Anyway, watch this space! Once I start TAing at App Academy, I'll be able to update this blog again more regularly.

(And to everyone who's been supporting me or offering advice, or just watching me as I wind along my journey, I just wanted to give a big thank-you. And I hope you continue to expect big things from me!)

EA Global, the largest ever public gathering of EAs, has left me reflecting on what it means to be an effective altruist.

A few weeks ago, 400+ attendees and prominent EA activists, including Will MacAskill and Nick Bostrom (and Elon Musk!), converged on a Google Campus in Mountain View to discuss the state and direction of the EA movement. I ended up donning a volunteer shirt and helping out&mdash;time-keeping for talks, directing and crowd-control, moving heavy objects (a weakness of many Effective Altruists), and scrambling to save the conference from various minor emergencies.

 It was an exhausting and important weekend, although it didn't feel important at the time.

Increasingly, EA has come to guide the direction of my life. I'm earning-to-give with my career (giving a third of all my earnings to high-impact charities), I'm helping to lead [.impact](&rdquo;dotimpact.im&rdquo;), a global EA volunteer group, and I'm helping run Bay Area effective altruism [workathons.](https://www.facebook.com/events/392649784261768/)

I'm taking an active role in helping effective altruism to grow. And it's growing at a meteoric rate. Since the formalization of the movement in 2011, it's more than doubled every year. Effective altruism is going to be big, and it has the potential to seriously impact the world.

I want to make sure that happens, and to make sure that impact is as big as it can be. For me, it's probably the highest-leverage way that I can change the world.

----

In saying this though, I've glossed over an important question. Why did I become an effective altruist to begin with?

There are two ways to answer that.

The first way is to say that all of the arguments are compelling. EA's critique of conventional altruism is rigorous and persuasive. If you, like me, are committed to moral consistency, it's hard not to be convinced. In a way, effective altruism begins by pulling softly on the threads of your beliefs, and by the time it's done, your moral imperatives look completely different.

Let's call that the ideological answer. It's the first reason why I'm an EA, and maybe someday I'll tell the story how effective altruism changed my mind.

But right now, I want to tell another story. I want to tell the story of why effective altruism changed not my mind, but my life. Why EA makes me do things that I wouldn't otherwise dream of doing&mdash;like devoting my life to it.

It's not because of the arguments or the ideologies. Those things are powerful, but arguments are paltry against all the history and conditioning behind a human life. It takes something more blunt than that to change someone's life. It takes something powerful and human.

Really, it takes a punch to the stomach.

The other night while walking home, I had such a punch.

----

I was at the office exceptionally late.

It was 1AM when I finally summoned the awareness that I ought to go home. I closed up my laptop, grabbed my messenger bag, put in my earphones and began down the stairwell. On the ground floor, the security guard, a weathered and prunish Asian man, was fast asleep in a leather chair. I gently opened and closed the building door behind me and stepped out onto Market Street.

At 1AM on a Tuesday, SoMa is deserted. The crisp, young professionals are nowhere to be seen. Even the homeless, usually selling their wares or arguing on a street corner, are absent. There are only a few scuffed-up bundles here and there, dreaming against the walls of buildings.

I turned the corner onto 5th street. It was silent, illuminated with street lights. Cars occasionally floated past. The night felt so barren, I could have been in any city in the world.

I can't explain it, but it was a scene of almost transcendent beauty. Do you know what I mean when I say that? There was nothing special about the sight of it. It's just that this was the world, undisturbed, and I was, for a moment, its only witness.

How long has it been since I felt completely alone, I wondered? A long time. It's an important feeling&mdash;perhaps the most important feeling of my entire life. Time and time again I return to it, or if I can't find it I go searching for it.

Looking up at the lights, walking down 5th street, hands in my pockets, I was thinking: this is it. This is the world. The only one I'll ever get to experience. I never asked for it, I don't even deserve it, but here it is.

I became aware of a song in my headphones. It was this one:

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MqWVegTsHZA/">[video]</div>

And I then remember: damn, am I lucky.

I'm lucky to be born in a rich country.

I'm lucky to have headphones, to own this messenger bag. To have two strong legs. To not be in a bundle on the side of this street. To not have grown up fighting drugs, or malaria, or theocracy, or a war. I'm lucky. I'm so goddamn lucky, and right now I barely even feel it.

I didn't earn my birth. I didn't earn my intelligence. I didn't earn my privilege, my health, my values, my messenger bag. It may as well have been divvied to me in an ancient, secret coup.

I didn't stop walking. The song was building in my ears.

Billions of humans in this world. And so many lives burdened and stunted by poverty, illness, trauma, war. Billions. Imagine if you could hear the sound of it all at once. That furious ocean of suffering, which is invisible to me because I'm here. Because of how quiet this street is. Because this street has conspired to squelch the sound and magnitude of that ocean.

----

But you see, it's not the suffering that gets me. I can accept suffering. Somewhere, someone will always be suffering, and I know that.

It's just the injustice of it. It's that the injustice is so big, so absolute, it's almost suffocating. It's so much that you can't swallow right. All around the world, billions of lives&mdash;billions, never given any relief, never given a way out of that ocean.

So why me? Why do I get to walk down this street in silence? Why am I the one with a laptop and a messenger bag?

You see, when I think about this, it makes me angry. It makes me fucking outraged. What would you do if you lived in such a world? In a world that conspires against itself, in a world that is arbitrary and unjust?

Would it make you sick? Would it make you want to goddamn do something about it? To start a revolution? To throw up arms against this invisible oppressor?

That's what it does to me.

It makes me the kind of mad that I almost don't care what I do. That I might do anything to fight it. That I might throw my entire life against this injustice, just to do it, just so I can say to myself and to my children that my eyes were open, that I saw that injustice, and I fought against it.

To me, that's the promise of EA.

To me, EA promises: if you want to do good in the world, I will show you the thing that will do the *most* good.

And when the stakes are so high, and when the question is so dire and important, how could you not take up that promise?

So that's what I've decided to do. That's why I became an effective altruist.

Perhaps you'll become one too.

Six months ago I decided I wanted to become a software developer. I had almost no coding background whatsoever, but screw it, I decided to take the leap. I applied to all of the coding bootcamps in San Francisco, and went into a cave to teach myself nothing but code. I ended up getting into my top choice, [App Academy](http://appacademy.io). I was crushing the program as the top student in my cohort. Two months into the three-month program, the founders asked me to come on board and help teach the course. I'm now working as one of App Academy's main instructors.

Students often want to know what led to my success. They also ask me what I might do differently if I were to do it over again. It's funny, because when I was going through this process, it seemed like all of the info out there on coding bootcamps was sparse and contradictory. So I decided to write the guide that I wish *I* had when going through this process. Consider this guide a synthesis of my own experiences and those of many other successful students.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5yYS6D-C3ew/">[video]</div>

**If you want to learn how to totally crush your coding bootcamp and land an awesome job as a software developer, this guide is for you.**

Let's start at the top.

## Step 0: Taking the Leap

#### Before we make any life-altering decisions, let's first consider: is a coding bootcamp the right choice for you?

Taking a coding bootcamp is a serious life commitment. It might sound like a fun and whimsical field trip into the world of programming, but realize: most of these coding bootcamps demand upwards of $15,000 and a full three months of your life, 80+ hours a week. If you decide to do this, you will have to blow through a lot of savings and the next several months of your life will be devoted to the singular task of learning how to code. In no uncertain terms, attending a coding bootcamp is taking a giant bet, with both your money and your time.

Are you ready to do that? Take this question seriously. Don't just nod to yourself&mdash;taking it seriously means honestly entertaining that it might *not* be the right choice.

#### Some reasons to think you shouldn't take a coding bootcamp:

* *You're not certain about coding.* To be clear, coding doesn't need to be your forever thing, but it's definitely gotta be your foreseeable-future thing.

* *You have a lot of demands on your time.* If you want to try to juggle your book club and a cocaine addiction and your Etsy business of hand-sewn Star Wars plushies, I wish you the best. But if you want to have a good chance of surviving, you're probably going to have to live a pretty minimalistic life for a while.

* *You're bad at math or analytical thinking.* This is pretty much the best predictor for who makes good coders. Coding doesn't really require a lot of math, though. It's just that being proficient in math usually means you have the right kind of thinking skills for excelling at programming.

* *You're doing it just because you want to make more money.* Money is a shitty motivator, and it won't sustain you. Do this because you actually want to learn how to code and you might enjoy making this your life.

* *You have weak communication skills.* This one might be counterintuitive. Isn't programming the stereotypical job for people with no communication skills? Au contraire, my friend. That might be true for fresh grads coming out of Berkeley. But you will not be a typical coder. Once you make it out of this bootcamp, you're going to be an oddball programmer with a non-traditional background. That means it's going to be up to you to sell yourself to iployers; your pedigree certainly won't do it for you. Coding bootcamps equip you with the knowledge to excel in a job, but it's 100% up to you to convince a hiring manager that you're a capable, friendly, cooperative person who they'll actually want to have join their team.

But don't let me deflate your balloon too much. Let's also look at the positive side!

#### Reasons to think you might do well in a coding bootcamp:

* *You're dissatisfied with your current job/life situation.*

* *You enjoy thinking analytically and you pick up new things quickly.*

* *You thrive in high-pressure environments.* You manage stress well.

* *You have considerable savings* or know people who are willing to loan you ~8 months of living expenses and/or your tuition fees. (There are a [number of companies](https://www.credible.com/blog/lending-news/student-loan-options-for-coding-bootcamps/) that can help with outside financing though.)

* *You are innately talented at math or logic* (even if you haven't done either in a while).

* *You have done some programming/web development before and enjoyed it.* (optional) Alternatively, you thrive on technical shit.

* *You're a capable typist and generally know your way around a computer.*

I'll assume going forward that you've thought about this, and you're sure this is where you're supposed to be. Let's start applying then.

## Step 1: Getting In

#### First, apply to every bootcamp in the region(s) you're considering.

There are four main reasons why it's crucial to apply to **every** bootcamp.

* The first reason is that it'll give you practice with the interview process. Even if you're dead-set on going to a particular boot camp (as I was), you'll get a lot out of going through multiple funnels simultaneously. Talking about yourself, working on basic coding problems in an interview context&mdash;these will become easier the more times you do it.

* The second reason is that having an acceptance in hand makes you more attractive to other boot camps. Especially if you're applying to all of the boot camps in a region, they'll all be more than happy to poach a student from a competitor. They're also likely to expedite you through their process if you tell them that you need to make a final decision soon.

* The third reason is that it lowers the stakes. Psychologically speaking, you're going to be less anxious and freaked out if your top choice interview is just one among the many interviews you're doing. Again, even if you're dead-set on going to only one or two of those schools, just having the illusion of fall-back options will trick your brain into calming the hell down. Every little bit helps.

* And lastly, do it because it's easy. Most of the applications are essentially the same, and none of them cost any money. So there's pretty much no downside to it.

#### A Breakdown of Coding Bootcamps in the Bay Area (skip if you're elsewhere)

App Academy, HackBright (women-only), and Dev Bootcamp are Ruby schools. (HackBright is technically Python, but Ruby is very similar to Python, and I believe they're willing to conduct your interview in Ruby). HackReactor and MakerSquare are pure JavaScript (MakerSquare was acquired by HackReactor, so these two schools now have a common application process). There are more schools, but the rest of them are far worse than these. Go ahead and apply to other schools too though, for the reasons stated above.

HackReactor and MakerSquare will require you to do all of your interviews in JS. The other schools are generally more flexible.

The general hierarchy of coding bootcamps looks something like this (take with a grain of salt): App Academy ≈ Hack Reactor ≈ Full Stack Academy &gt; HackBright &gt; Flat Iron School &gt; Dev Bootcamp &gt; Everyone else. So I'd start the application process for the weaker schools first, and move my way up the hierarchy so that by the time I get to a top school's interview, I've already banged out a few of the easier ones.

I'll assume that you, like me, have no real coding background and have to decide which language to learn first. There are a lot of tradeoffs here. You could learn JavaScript, which is required for HackReactor's application process. But this has two downsides: JS is significantly harder to learn as your first language compared to Ruby (it's more confusing, verbose, and syntactically unforgiving). The second downside is that HackReactor requires the most preparation of all of the schools to make it through their application process, and it also has the most backed up start dates.

Given that, I decided to learn Ruby first. This allowed me to finish the application process for App Academy, Dev Bootcamp, and General Assembly (as well as a couple other schools) much faster, and get a swifter introduction to programming. I figured if I didn't do well enough on my first batch of applications, then I'd learn JavaScript afterward and apply to the JS schools. That ended up not being necessary, but it's still the strategy I'd advocate now.

App Academy was my number one choice due to their tuition-free model. Most of these other schools make you pay 15-18k in cash up front, while App Academy only requires a small deposit and then takes 18% of your first year's income *if* you land a software development job. If you end up leaving the program or not landing a software engineering job, they refund your deposit and you basically lose nothing. In short, they're the one school that you can kind of take &ldquo;risk-free,&rdquo; because their business model is to literally make a bet on your success. That coupled with their stellar placement stats (97% employment rate, 105k average salary in the Bay Area) made them the clear top choice for me. But your priorities might look different.

The remainder of my advice will assume that you'll be studying Ruby, but all of this advice will be completely applicable if you're studying JS as well.

#### Learning the Basics of Coding

Start with [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com). Work through their entire Ruby track. Don't waste your time learning HTML/CSS or any web development stuff (like Rails); that's all totally irrelevant until you actually get into a coding bootcamp. In your interviews you will only be considered on the basis of your programming ability, not your web development abilities, so the rest can wait. HTML/CSS is pretty easy once you have the rest down anyway.

Your time on Codecademy will serve as a litmus test. Was it kinda fun? Did you pick it up quickly, or was it like pulling teeth? If you're in the former camp, you're in good shape and this might work out well. If it was a significantly uphill struggle or you didn't really enjoy it, then it might be a sign that you should turn back. Take this signal seriously.

Once you finish Codecademy, I'd start sending out your first applications to all but the top schools. Note, coding school applications move *fast*. Aside from scheduling issues, most decisions are made within a few days to a week. It's nothing like applying to traditional schools. So once you apply, the train starts moving! (You can slow it down if you need to though; just tell them that something came up and you need to delay your next step. No one really minds if you do that.)

Now it's time to start working on proper coding problems. App Academy has some [prep work](http://prepwork.appacademy.io/coding-test-1/) that you can do to get yourself up to speed on basic Ruby. It goes over a basic introduction to programming, which should reinforce what you learned at Codecademy. There's also a set of coding problems that you can work on using [Cloud9](http://c9.io) as an online development environment. App Academy provides [detailed instructions](http://prepwork.appacademy.io/coding-test-1/setup) on how to get this set up.

Work through all of these coding problems. You want to be able to do all of these. It's okay if they take you a long time the first time; any problem that took you an exorbitant amount of time, wrap back around and redo them again. You should be able to get each of these problems in

**Some programming tips early on**: make sure to respect proper indentation. Any looping constructs (while loops, for loops, each loops) require a new level of identation. Any &ldquo;end&rdquo; statement should be de-indented. The body of a function must also be indented. Bad indentation habits is one of the easiest ways to slip up early on: you think you ended a function or a loop when you actually haven't. Get used to making your indentation perfect, both because people will count it against you if you don't, and it'll make you much less likely to make simple mistakes. Other common gotchas include: forgetting to increment your iterator (specifically in while loops) and off-by-one-errors.

Once you've finished all those coding problems, you're ready to apply anywhere. Send in your application to App Academy or whatever your top school is.

You'll now want to start working on more advanced programming problems so you can pass your later-stage interviews. App Academy will give access to a second set of coding problems to work on after your first coding test (which you should have done by now). You should complete the second set of coding problems with the same rigor as with the first batch. Once you finish those, you should now be confident enough in your coding skills to grapple with a wider range of programming problems. Let's start getting serious now.

Get on [Coderbyte](http://coderbyte.com/CodingArea/Challenges/). Do *all* of the Easy and Medium difficulty problems. Their interface is a little crappy and buggy, so I'd recommend using [repl.it](http://repl.it) (set the language to Ruby) to work through the problems.

(A micro-primer on [repl.it](http://repl.it): the left side can be used as a text editor, which you can load into the interactive terminal on the right side by pressing the play button. Basically, write methods or define classes on the left side, click the play button, and then call those methods in the terminal on the right side to view their output. It makes for a pretty nice coding scratchpad.)

Once you're done with Coderbyte, you should probably be ready for your final interview. If you have more free time, go back over all of the problems you've previously solved and solve them again. You can also skip below and do some Codewars if you want to improve your skills further.

Eventually, you'll schedule your final interview. Standard mental game advice applies: get a good night's sleep (force it if you have to&mdash;take some [melatonin](wikipedia.org/wiki/melatonin)), do some low-intensity exercise ~30 minutes before your interview (some jogging or jumping jacks are usually good), and then spend the time immediately before your interview doing breathing exercises/meditation.

Remember, when it comes to your performance on the interview, the marginal hour spent studying will be way less valuable than the marginal hour spent sleeping. Get plenty of sleep.

Then do your interview. Nail it.

Now you're in. Holy shit. Now celebrate.

## Step 2: Pre-work

You're in now. If you haven't quit your job yet, do it now. You'll want to devote all of your time to coding and preparing to live in a new(?) city.

You should have a decent gap until your start date. For App Academy, you'll have a lot of prep work to do. This prep work is really important, so allocate enough time to get it done!

But if you have the bandwidth and want to really crush the course, I'd advocate honing your skills further. Get onto [Codewars](http://codewars.com). Codewars was pretty much my secret weapon coming into App Academy. It's what I claim made me, hands-down, the strongest programmer coming into my class. And I'll explain to you exactly how I used it to accelerate my learning.

Given that I've worked as a mental coach for several years, I know a shit-ton about the psychology of learning. And from a learning perspective, Codewars is the best platform out of any of the ones I found (and there are a bunch: HackerRank, Codility, CodeEval).

Codewars works through a ranking system. Each problem on Codewars is ranked from 8 Kyu (easy) to 1 Kyu (extremely hard). You have an overall skill level, starting at 8 Kyu and working your way up. You gain points and rank up by solving coding problems that other users created. Each problem has its own test suite that you must pass in order to win points. But if you look at the solutions without solving the problem, you forfeit any possibility of winning points off that problem.

The key to Codewars is that every solution gets voted on Reddit-style, which makes the very best solutions bubble up to the top. This allows you to solve the problem, then see the *best way to solve the problem*. This will usually teach you some new techniques or functions in the standard library.

So here's what your workflow should look like: find a problem, and try to solve it ([repl.it](repl.it) is often your friend here). If you can't solve it within 30 minutes, then just look at the solution. Whether you solve it or not, read the best solution and try to parse it. It will often be kind of mysterious and use methods that you don't know. Go look up those methods in the documentation, play around with them, make sure you understand what they do and why the solution works. Make sure you get it.

This next step is essential. **Now do the problem again and try to re-implement the ideal solution that you just read. Do it from memory.** If you forget, go back and look at the solution, and then start over. DON'T SKIP THIS STEP FOR ANY PROBLEM, NO MATTER HOW SMALL.

If you do this, you will become a killer. I promise. I did it, and coming into my program I was way ahead of anyone in my mastery over Ruby. I also advocated this approach to my best friend, a former paramedic with no coding experience whatsoever. When the TAs read his coding test, they told me &ldquo;your friend is a beast. No wonder, I guess.&rdquo;

This method works for several reasons.

1) It ruthlessly trains you in the art of solving problems. If you want to get better at solving coding problems, the best way to do it is just *solving lots of coding problems*. Most of solving these problems is just pattern-recognition anyway, and it builds up a lot of exposure to many different problem patterns.

2) It teaches you tons of methods in the standard library, and makes you use them and grapple with them. This imprints them on your unconscious mind stronger than just reading docs or groping through tutorials.

3) By typing out the best solutions from memory, it'll teach you by hand to write good code style and intelligent, concise techniques. Don't underestimate the power of visceral learning. Just by typing out the code that someone else came up with, you'll absorb the learning through your fingers.

If you do this, by the time you enter your program, you'll be a programming wizard. Take my word for it.

I'd also recommend trying to get as far as possible through [Ruby Monk](http://rubymonk.com) to really solidify your knowledge on the inner-workings of Ruby. I'd say it's less important than Codewars, but if you have the time, intersperse Codewars with some Ruby Monk and try to finish all four of its tracks (though the first one you can probably skip at this point). Ruby Monk will solidify your knowledge on the internals of the language, while Codewars will transform you into a problem-solving machine.

Now finish your prep work and get ready for life in a new city!

Next time, we'll pick up once the program begins, in Step 3, and see how to excel in your course. Watch this space!

2015 has come to a close and I've just finished my first year's donations. In all I gave 33% of my pre-tax income, which since I started my job in June, amounts to $21,200 USD I donated to high-impact charities.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HyMfMYRpHUg">[video]</div>

## Donations

I donated *$5,300* to AMF, the *[Against Malaria Foundation](https://www.againstmalaria.com/)*, which distributes low-cost anti-mosquito bednets in parts of Africa that are ravaged by malaria. AMF is ranked by [Givewell](http://givewell.org) as the most marginally impactful charity in the world.

![](http://www.goodventures.org/images/grants/against-malaria-general-support-2012.gif)

----

I gave another *$5,300* to [*.impact*](http://dotimpact.im), a grassroots EA organization with which I've grown more involved over the last year. .impact is best known for creating a ton of EA infrastructure, including the [EA Forums](http://effective-altruism.com) and [EA Hub](http://effectivealtruismhub.com). Their latest project is LEAN, which helps to seed and support EA chapters all around the world, helping to foster the movement at the grassroots level.

![](http://dotimpact.im/assets/dotimpactlogo-new-ozzie.png)

----

I gave the remainder, *$10,600* to the [*Center for Effective Altruism*](http://centreforeffectivealtruism.org), specifically to the [EA Outreach team](https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/winter-fundraiser-2015/ea-outreach), which is run by Kerry Vaughan and Tyler Alterman. EA Outreach was responsible for [EA Global](http://eaglobal.org/), the major EA conference this year at Google HQ, and have ambitious plans on how to grow the movement and influence more of the world toward evidence-based giving. I think the impact they could have is enormous, and so I decided to give them half of my donations this year.

![](3 of my nominal income. I haven't been able to put much aside for savings, but I'm at least saving a little. The cost of living in SF is pretty steep, so I feel like I've kept my spending respectably low.

## My First Year in Tech

It's pretty crazy how far I've come in this time. I still remember when I first moved into my tiny shared bedroom in San Francisco back in April. I had no idea what to expect. I definitely didn't imagine that I'd get this far in less than a year.

After I matriculated into App Academy, I worked my ass off to learn programming. I was routinely the last person to leave the office, working from 9AM till midnight or later, 7 days a week. Despite how hard it was, it was invigorating to have such focus again.

I quickly rose to the top of my class. At the end of the first 8 weeks of the 12-week course, the founders whisked me into a room and asked me to join the instructional team. I accepted the offer. June 1st, I began my career in tech teaching at App Academy, the coding school I'd just attended. I'd also already begun earning-to-give, a mere two months after coming out here.

To my chagrin, I was immediately placed on a special project working alongside CTO and co-founder of the company, Ned Ruggeri (a Google alum). He put me in charge of all programming work for App Academy's back-end applicant tracking system and the internal tools for our marketing and admissions team.

I soon began giving lectures. Every lecture is rated by the students and tracked for performance. My lectures won the highest rating among all of the teaching staff. Thanks to my performance and the CTO's trust in me, he handed me the entire algorithms curriculum&mdash;a 15-day series of 2-hour lectures covering all of the most important data structures and algorithms in computer science. I was the first person in the history of the company since the CTO to deliver these lectures.

Then in August&mdash;four months ago, three months after App Academy first hired me&mdash;the CEO asked me to stay on permanently. He offered me the title of Head Instructor. I declined. I told them I wanted to help build the company rather than work in instruction. I already knew how to teach, but I wanted to contribute to the business at a deeper level. After some negotiation, I accepted the position of Director of Product for App Academy.

I didn't write about it on my blog because I've barely had the time, but it's a pretty awesome role. Along with writing some of the curriculum and occasionally lecturing, I work alongside the CEO to develop new products, establish partnerships, lead the revenue strategy, and grow the company. I also manage all of the engineering on App Academy's back-end (including our recent website re-design), as well as the new products we currently have in the pipeline. I also just generally do executive stuff and help keep the company running effectively.

It's been a pretty amazing year. I would never have expected to be where I am now when all of this began. I'm growing really rapidly.

But I think 2016 is going to be even more amazing.

Here's to a new year. Here's to changing the world. Here's to staying hungry and learning like crazy.

A couple weeks ago I had my last day as Director of Product at App Academy. This coming Monday, I will be starting work as a software engineer at Airbnb.

Here's the story of why I left App Academy, the tribulations of my ensuing job search, and why I decided to join Airbnb.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sYT_6yGY6LM/">[video]</div>

<div class="note">
<p>Disclaimer: in this blog post and the next, I'll be speaking frankly about compensation packages I received from (larger) companies. I do this for two reasons.</p>

<p>First, because I believe companies often have an unfair informational advantage over candidates, and providing some transparency helps to level the playing field and shift power toward candidates. Second, because as someone <a href="https://haseebq.com/why-ive-decided-to-devote-my-career-to-earning-to-give/">earning-to-give</a>, I already intend to write publicly about my compensation. My hope is that this transparency encourages others to give more. It also pre-commits me to my own intended donations.</p>

<p>My small caveat is that I won't mention the compensation packages from very small (&lt;25 person) startups, which includes App Academy. At very early stage companies, I suspect making compensation packages public is more likely to disrupt a company's operations than to equip candidates with useful data.</p>
</div>

## Leaving App Academy

As Director of Product at App Academy, my role was an amalgam of various responsibilities. I worked with the CEO to help shape the direction of the company, I established new programs and partnerships, I developed new educational products, I wrote curriculum, I worked one-on-one to teach students, I gave many of our CS-heavy lectures, and I contributed to our internal software engineering projects. Needless to say, I wore many different hats and learned a tremendous amount.

But it was around Christmas when I realized that my role was drifting away from software and computer science, and more toward the business side of running a coding school. I was originally attracted to the role because I wanted to immerse myself in a combination of product and engineering/CS. But predominantly, my time was getting monopolized by business and operational tasks.

I wasn't learning as much anymore. The engineering and computer science topics that really interested me were largely orthogonal to App Academy's bottom line. So more and more of my free time I spent reading and thinking about things that were happening at other companies.

Since back in my poker days, I've always had the instinct to seek the company of people who knew more than me. That relentless osmosis is part and parcel of how I quickly became a strong poker player. I'd arrived in the Bay Area not even a year ago, and already I was often the most knowledgeable person in the room.

The conclusion should've been obvious. I was in the wrong room.

I voiced my concerns with Kush and Ned, the founders of App Academy. As much as I loved working with them, after some deliberation, it was clear to me that it was time to move on from App Academy.

The question was, to where?

## Preparing for my Job Search

I had never done an actual job search before. Because I had been hired directly by App Academy after completing the program, I didn't have a solid resume or any projects to speak of.

So, in the free time I had available to me on evenings and weekends, I began beefing up my portfolio. First, I built out my Asteroids game, getting it presentable and fully playable. ([Check it out](http://haseeb-qureshi.github.io/Asteroids/)! It's pretty fun and fully developed now.)

![](https://github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/Asteroids/raw/master/assets/asteroids.gif)

Second, I made a brand new project, heavier on computer science and built in React, to show off my knowledge of front-end development. This project took quite a while to get off the ground, but the process was very satisfying.

Basically, I built an interface that would visually demonstrate local search algorithms solving the 8-queens problem.

[The 8-queens problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) is a classic puzzle of how to arrange 8 queens on a chess board so that none of the queens threaten one another (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). On an 8×8 board, out of 4,426,165,368 possible configurations, only 92 configurations satisfy the puzzle. This makes it prime candidate for a local search or constraint satisfaction problem.

It's pretty fascinating! Many of the best algorithms to solve this problem involve randomization, including iterative repair, which is by far the fastest algorithm I found. [Give it a spin!](http://haseeb-qureshi.github.io/n-queens-visualizer/)

![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/eb84b58a08982181867a06661a7d4c51d7453ffb/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4e4c41464949742e676966)

Having wrapped up my projects, I spent the majority of my free time grinding on algorithms problems and strengthening my knowledge of system design. Before long, I was prepped for the interview circuit.

It was time to start the job hunt.

## The Hunt

I started sending out applications. The standard App Academy advice is to blast out crap-loads of applications. All junior resumes get a low base rate of responses, so the best way to maximize your chances of finding a good mutual fit is to apply widely and aggressively. Basically, treat it as a numbers game.

Yet given my success at App Academy and having been paid to do software engineering, I figured that I'd be a much stronger candidate than the marginal App Academy student. Despite the fact that I was working full time and it wouldn't be easy to send out applications en masse, I was confident I'd be fine.

I couldn't've been more wrong.

Of the 20+ applications I sent, I was rejected from every single one without so much as a technical screen. One recruiter from Udacity did actually get on the phone with me&mdash;I had pointed out a CSS error on their website in my application and uploaded a private Youtube video showing them how to fix it. The recruiter thanked me and we joked about it, only for him to later tell me they weren't looking for anyone with my skillset. Again, without even a technical screen.

I started to worry. Was I just completely unsellable? Was my background just too all over the place to be worth anything as an engineer?

My resume was a hodgepodge, no doubt. Professional poker player to mental coach to author to programming instructor to Director of Product, with a degree in English from the University of Texas. Maybe my resume was automatically getting binned everywhere it landed.

Or perhaps, and more likely, the problem was that I was trying to get in through the wrong door. I'm reminded of a quote I recently read by Alex Banayan:

> All highly successful people treat life, business, and success just like a nightclub. There are always three ways in.
>
> There's the First Door, where 99% of people wait in line, hoping to get in.
>
> There's the Second Door, where billionaires and royalty slip through.
>
> **But then there is always, always&hellip;the Third Door.** It's the entrance where you have to jump out of line, run down the alley, climb over the dumpster, bang on the door a hundred times, crack open the window, and sneak through the kitchen. But there's always a way in.
>
> Whether it's how Bill Gates sold his first piece of software, or how Steven Spielberg became the youngest director at a major studio in Hollywood &mdash; they all took the Third Door.

Almost everything in my life I've been successful at, I've gotten in through that third door. Becoming a world-class poker player under the age of 18, learning how to code and getting into coding bootcamps in a single frenzied week, or getting hired into App Academy straight as a student and three months later rising up to become Director of Product and teaching their entire algorithms curriculum.

Perhaps this was another case of needing to find that Third Door.

I began plumbing my network. I had one big advantage I hadn't yet leveraged: the students I'd taught. Many of them were working at very strong companies, though they were mostly very junior. At least with their referrals, I'd be able to crack open that window.

Every student I asked was more than excited to refer me. Finally, I had fast-tracked myself into the processes at several awesome companies: Shift, FutureAdvisor, PagerDuty, and Twilio.

I was rejected at all of them. Again, without even a technical screen.

By now I was panicking. But somehow, through the flurry of rejections, a referral from a classmate of mine who was working at 23AndMe came through. He had paired with me during our cohort and spoke very highly of me, so they scheduled me for a technical phone screen.

I was nervous, but once I got on the phone and got rolling on some concrete questions, I crushed everything my interviewer asked me. He was blown away. He told me he'd never heard as thorough of a technical analysis on this problem before, and immediately invited me to do an onsite at their headquarters in Mountain View.

I killed the onsite. And when I say killed, I mean murdered with such ruthless brutality that my children's children will carry the sin with them. To this day, it's the onsite that I felt most confident in. I remember pacing back and forth at the CalTrain station as I awaited my train back to San Francisco, savoring how masterfully I deconstructed each and every question they posed to me. It seemed like everyone who'd interviewed me was ebullient at how quickly and rigorously I'd answered all their questions.

Finally, it seemed like I'd cracked the code.

A week and a half later I open my inbox, and there fresh and white, a reply from my 23AndMe recruiter. The subject: 23AndMe. I open it up to read:

> &ldquo;Thank you for your patience and your time to meet with our SWE team. We appreciate the opportunity to consider you for employment with 23andMe. I want to update you on our search and let you know at this time we are moving ahead with another candidate.&rdquo;

###  To be Continued…

(This is getting pretty long, so I'll finish up the second part in a day or two.)

<p class="note">(Note: this is the second part of this story. <a href="https://haseebq.com/farewell-app-academy-hello-airbnb-part-i/">You can read the first part here.</a>)</p>

Despite the rejection from 23AndMe, I kept pushing.

I applied to the all the big hiring websites. [Hired](https://hired.com) rejected me from their platform. I got no bites anywhere on [AngelList](https://angel.co) or LinkedIn&mdash;not even cold e-mails from recruiters. Nothing from [WhiteTruffle](https://whitetruffle.com) or [SmartHires](https://www.smarthires.io).

Not a breath of interest anywhere.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7cA0mwsfpVE/">[video]</div>

I kept on. I asked friends, students, anyone I knew for referrals. I started reaching out to non-engineers. I asked anyone at all who worked at all at a tech company I found compelling.

I was nervous. Was I a fraud? At App Academy I might have seemed like a paragon, but to the rest of the world&hellip;was I simply not good enough?

## A Swing of the Pendulum

In the middle of this flurry, I created an account on TripleByte. [TripleByte](https://triplebyte.com) is a young YC startup that's trying to change tech hiring. From [their manifesto](https://triplebyte.com/manifesto):

> Credentials should not be used as a proxy for talent. Education and work history are meaningful but relying solely on them results in missing good programmers. Good programmers come from all types of background. It's what you can do that matters, not where you went to school.

Their interview process is completely blind to credentials. They decide to work with you purely on the basis of a technical assessment, then they learn about your credentials and then introduce you to startups they determine are a good match. Though they mostly work with experienced software engineers, I decided to give them a try.

To my surprise, I was able to pass their anonymous programming quiz and I was automatically invited to an onsite assessment. I showed up sheepishly to their office on King Street, and over an intense three hours I was grilled by my interviewer on coding, data structures, algorithms, and system design. At the end of the interview, he asked me what my computer science background was. None, I told him. I'd learned this stuff on my own and from teaching at App Academy. He was taken aback, and told me I was incredibly strong for only having studied this material less than a year.

The next day, TripleByte called me. They wanted to work with me! They'd introduce me directly to startups in the YC network. This was exciting&mdash;there were a ton of companies in YC network I wanted to talk to: Stripe, Twitch, Airbnb, to name a few.

Well, as it turned out, those companies weren't really looking for someone like me. Since TripleByte is a two-sided process, they matched me up with companies for which there was a good mutual fit&mdash;Stripe, Twitch, or Airbnb were nowhere on that list. However, one of the companies they matched me with was Gusto, formerly Zenpayroll (and now a timely Zenefits competitor). I'd previously had my eye on them, so I was excited to see them matched up with me. They also lined up an onsite at a small YC startup called Flexport.

TripleByte had gotten things moving. But even more importantly, they had given me back some confidence. TripleByte wanting to work with me was a small affirmation, to be sure&mdash;it wasn't even a job offer yet. But it felt like I'd finally pierced the membrane. If these guys thought I was good&hellip;I must have it. I just gotta prove that to everyone else now.

## Onsites and Offers

I set off to the onsites. The first of the two, Flexport, was a freight company. In many ways, it seemed more like a logistics company than it was about technology company. But I felt like I performed well in the onsite.

A couple days later: no offer.

I was supposed to be upset, but by now this was an old game. I brushed it off. Each interview I could feel was making me better at interviewing. It was getting easier and easier to relax, to ask for what I needed, to make jokes, to grill my interviewers. I was getting into my rhythm now.

Rejected? It is what it is. Just keep putting in the practice, I told myself.

Next was Gusto. They were a groovy company (no shoes in the office!), and the interview was a delight. They told me they'd get back to me within a week.

Shortly afterward, an onsite from Yelp pulled through (my referral was through a non-engineer!). I went onsite and completely rocked it. Every interviewer was clearly impressed, and they immediately asked me for my references afterward. Perhaps things were looking up! It seemed like one of Gusto or Yelp might actually convert into an offer.

All the while, I kept putting more irons in the grill (gotta keep that kitchen running), and kept studying up on algorithms and system design. Around then, I got an e-mail in my inbox from TripleByte:

> Saw you're starting to get some interviews booked with companies!
>
> I actually wanted to throw another company option into the mix, us :) We're hiring to build out our engineering team, we really enjoyed meeting you and would love to talk more about that if its of interest. Just let me know and I can give you a call tomorrow!

Shit. Really?

I hadn't considered joining a super small company. I'd already spent the last year at a 25 person startup; TripleByte was only 5 people. But I knew entrepreneurship was somewhere in my future, and eventually I'd be joining a super early stage startup (if not founding it myself). TripleByte was a fantastic company, already with huge traction in the tech hiring space. Their founder, Harj Taggar, was a former YC partner, and one of the most charismatic and capable people I've met.

They wanted me. A company actually wanted me! A good one! I laugh now, but it was a revelation to me. They invited me in for another onsite so the rest of the team could vet me.

Before I could savor it too long, I received a phone call soon after. Yelp recruiter. Yelp wanted to make an offer.

And with that, the first domino fell.

----

Then came the Gusto recruiter. Gusto wanted to make an offer.

A TripleByte offer came soon in tow. First I had nothing, now I had three offers in front of me.

And yet, it was a little bittersweet. Yelp's offer was 105K salary with ~17K/yr in equity. Gusto hit around 115K with comparable equity in options, and TripleByte was in the same ballpark.

Now, if you're outside tech (or the Bay Area), those might sound like knock-down amazing offers. But all of these offers were lower than I was currently making, and they were all for explicitly junior roles.

Still, 105K might sound like a lot of money to be miffed about. But in San Francisco, with the second highest cost of living in the US (behind only Manhattan), the purchasing power of $105K in SF is the same as making about $57K in Austin, Texas. I also still owed App Academy tuition (18% of my first year's salary), which was deferred because of my employment by App Academy. That 18% would come due on whatever offer I accepted. And of course on top of that, I'd also be donating a third of my income.

But really, what stuck out most to me is that I'd be leaving App Academy to a downgrade. I would be no better off than if I'd just joined those companies a year before. My goal, somewhere in my head, was to make at least more than I was making now. An arbitrary benchmark in a lot of ways, but it was hard to give up.

Was what I'd learned over the last year working at App Academy not worth anything on the market?

Maybe not. Perhaps I just had to accept it.

----

Now that I had offers in hand, it was time to turn the crank. I reached out to every company I was talking to and told them I'd just received several offers, but was very much interested in moving forward. With that, suddenly recruiters started tripping over themselves to get me on site. I was no longer the ugly boy at the party.

I started mowing down onsites. My performance and experience were no different, yet I was treated completely differently. Phone screen from Google. Gusto raised their offer. Phone screen from Stripe. Yelp raised their offer. TripleByte raised their offer. Then the phone screen at Google converted to onsite.

Bam. Suddenly Google was in sight. I felt like Captain Ahab: for me, Google was the Big One.

My Google recruiter worked for the Youtube team (headquartered in San Bruno). That meant if I were to receive an offer, the Youtube team would have first dibs on me. The interview process is standardized Google-wide though, and Google would ultimately be my employer. I spent the weekend before practicing and took the day off from work so I could head down to San Bruno for the interview.

I arrived that morning at the San Bruno BART stop, hardly having gotten any sleep the night before, and walked 30 minutes to the Youtube campus in downtown San Bruno. It was still early, so I sat in the lobby and read over my notes from Cracking the Coding Interview for some thirty minutes, trying to keep my cool. Finally, the recruiter came out and met me and brought me to the interview room.

Unequivocally, Google was the toughest and most nerve-wracking interview I've ever done. The problems were complex and challenging, all abstract and extremely algorithms-heavy. They didn't ask me a single thing about architecture, systems design, web development&mdash;all they cared was that I could solve hard abstract computer science problems. All the interviewers&mdash;clearly brilliant (and all older white men)&mdash;were stony and tight-lipped about my performance.

I walked back to the BART station that evening, exhausted and completely drained, without any idea whether I'd done well or bombed.

A week later, I got a phone call from the Google recruiter.

I was in. Google wanted me.

----

Their offer was reasonably strong&mdash;120K salary with a 15% guaranteed end-of-year bonus and 24K/yr in RSUs. The total package came out to 162K/yr annualized&mdash;much stronger than my other offers, but around the ballpark of what fresh graduates of App Academy who landed at Google would earn. In other words, it seemed they didn't place me very high on their spectrum. But whatever, right? It was Google! I got Google!

With that, the floodgates opened. Just the whiff of the Google name got recruiters into a frenzy. Companies that wouldn't even look at me now bent over backwards to expedite me through their funnels.

Stripe onsite. Uber phone screen. Twitch phone screen. Uber onsite. Stripe offer. Twitch onsite. Uber offer. Twitch offer. The offers came in, stronger and stronger. All the irons I'd put in the fire were now going off like Roman candles.

Which left me with the question of: well, shit, what do I do with them?

## Deciding Factors

As the offers came in, I weighed them seriously. Every single company I talked to was compelling and had aspects that made me want to work there.

But in the end, it was hard to argue against Google being the best choice.

The first and most visceral reason was I'd never have to deal with this BS again. Google would be a golden mark on my resume&mdash;like the Harvard of software engineering. Never again would I have to worry about credentials, or people tossing my resume without reading it. Google is the one name I'd be able to brandish anywhere as *undeniable* proof of my legitimacy as an engineer.

Part of it had to do with my ego, no doubt. But this job search had shown me that part of it was very real and material.

Of course, then there was the compensation. Google would be hard to beat. Like Yelp, Google was a mature public company, so its equity compensation was as solid as cash. That liquidity is an important factor when it comes to earning-to-give&mdash;it means I can [give sooner](https://80000hours.org/2012/04/the-haste-consideration), which has compounding positive impact and flow-through effects.

On top of that, Google was the only company to do a donation matching program, up to $6,000. That's an extra $6,000 a year that goes to charity that otherwise wouldn't. When it came to earning-to-give and building my career, when I looked at the numbers, it seemed clear I couldn't justify choosing any company other than Google.

At that point, it seemed like a done deal. Companies like Uber, Twitch, Stripe, TripleByte, were all awesome companies. But it had to be Google.

Google! I was on cloud nine. I was ready for everything to wrap up as I figured out which bus I would be taking to San Bruno, planned out my morning workout regimen, and all the rest.

But the irons in the fire were still shooting off sparks. Offers improved, sometimes without any prompting on my part. They became increasingly stronger and stronger. Soon, they started overtaking Google's.

I hadn't negotiated with Google at all, so I knew the Google offer would move upward. I expected Google to settle somewhere around 180K all-in, which would be a healthy jump upward. But I started to really think: what would it take for me to turn down Google?

It was a tough question. Because I was in a competitive situation, Google had allowed me to start chatting with Youtube hiring managers and essentially pick my team.

I was offered a spot on the Youtube Red team, doing back-end work in C++. A small and fast-moving team in one of Youtube's shiniest new projects. It would be tough, certainly, to learn the technology and start becoming productive. But I'd be doing world-class engineering, and have a world-class company on my resume.

And yet, I couldn't deny: there was something energetically captivating about each and every startup I talked to. There was something deeper about them that attracted me, something was missing from Google. Not just the growth and the responsibility, or the greater self-determination. Each of these companies were innovators, creating new value in an uncertain future, and&mdash;they needed my help.

They actually needed my help. That was captivating. And it was hard to ignore that I didn't really feel that in my interactions with Google.

But Google continually assured me that they'd be able to beat any other startup's offers. It seemed like a decision they were happy to make for me. As other companies kept bidding up, the Google offer moved up to 185K. And as I was moving into final negotiations, they assured me there was still more room for the offer to grow.

More room to grow? How bad did Google actually want me?

## Enter Airbnb

It's funny. I had initially been rejected by an Airbnb recruiter for a different position more than a month before. Airbnb wasn't even on my radar. So when Ned, the CTO of App Academy told me he'd put me in touch with his friend David at Airbnb, I mostly brushed it off.

Upon Ned's glowing recommendation, David met with me and agreed to refer me into Airbnb. With his referral, I was promptly un-rejected. David was a senior engineer there, and his recommendation seemed to carry a lot of clout (the Google offer helped of course), so I was quickly shuffled through to the phone screen.

I wasn't expecting to do too well&mdash;I'd read in many places that Airbnb had an extremely challenging interview, and that they were more credentials-focused than other companies. So much so that I'd never heard of a bootcamp student getting placed at Airbnb. Apparently they used to post on their job listings: &ldquo;no bootcampers, please.&rdquo;

On the phone interview, I received a pretty challenging problem&mdash;I remember thinking when I got it that I was going to mess it up. But somehow I solved it with ease, and all of my outputs were correct. I'm not sure whether to attribute it to the accruing notches on my belt or to blind luck, but I aced the phone screen and they eagerly brought me on-site.

I've always had a lot of respect for Airbnb as a company&mdash;I was an early Airbnb user myself&mdash;but even as I was walking into their large and beautiful campus, my mind was already made up. I was joining Google.

The Airbnb interview was long and challenging. But, unlike the Google interview, it was invigorating. I met with payments engineers, infrastructure engineers, even a political analyst who worked on European Airbnb regulation. I was challenged on my understanding of algorithms, of caching layers and database indices, I was questioned on my beliefs about the human right of free movement across borders and on the future of travel.

I loved it. I loved everyone I met. Even more, I loved the spirit of Airbnb. Everything about it&mdash;the beautiful cosmopolitan office built as an homage to Airbnbs around the world, the people, the technology, the raw energy and drive toward connecting the world more tightly together.

Airbnb's mission is simply, &ldquo;Belong Anywhere.&rdquo; I've been both an Airbnb guest and a host for years, and before that I was an avid Couchsurfer and Couchsurfing host. I believe strongly in the culture of sharing and interconnection.

But even so. Yeah, Airbnb was pretty cool. (And walking distance to my house!) But still, Google is Google&mdash;the tech equivalent of getting an invitation to the Justice League. How could I turn that down?

After the interview, Airbnb was slow to get back to me. Being a challenging interview, I was unsure whether an offer would come through&mdash;much less, if it could change anything. I'd already finished my last day working at App Academy, and was now officially between jobs. I decided to head home for a bit to wrap up my negotiations and rest up before starting my next gig. I had a short deadline until I wanted to start, and let each of the companies know. It was now time to go into final negotiations.

## Turning Point

I get the phone call. Airbnb wants to make an offer. I have less than a week, but they're scrambling to piece everything together to meet my deadline. They'll get back to me.

They get back. Initial offer, 220K.

220K?

Jesus Christ.

What??

What on earth are they doing offering me 220K? This company must be out of its goddamn mind. No wonder tech is so overvalued. I lost my shit.

I had to take this really seriously now. Airbnb's offer was highly illiquid, but they were offering me a very strong base salary: 130K, 25K signing bonus, and 65K worth of RSUs a year. Not as liquid as Google, no doubt. But Airbnb as a company was barreling toward an IPO, already worth more than 23B, and was of the most robust tech companies from a business and revenue perspective. Besides, if I'm risk-neutral&mdash;which I think I am&mdash;then it's a clearly better deal.

I began really weighing things. Google&hellip;was Google. I already knew its advantages.

But at Airbnb, I'd clearly be able to take on more responsibility more quickly. The engineering organization was slated to double within a year. I was already very familiar with Airbnb's tech stack, mostly Ruby on Rails, since it was what I'd been teaching at App Academy and developing on for the last year. It was also younger company. Unlike Google and its &ldquo;lifers,&rdquo; this was a place where I'd be more likely to meet people in an earlier stage in their lives&mdash;and meet potential co-founders.

Of course, it was also walking distance (the ol' commute-less commute).

But, seemingly more affecting than all of those things&mdash;they needed me. At Google, I'd be a smart person sitting in a smart person chair. I'd be doing serious engineering work no doubt, but by the time I'd be done, I'd be walking away having changed little more than my own resume.

At Airbnb, they really needed my help. They believed I could make a difference. For the life of me I couldn't figure out why, but they made it clear. They thought I was valuable, and they wanted someone with my experience.

God, I'm a sap.

I had less than a week to decide. I didn't know how to make the decision. So I started trying to evaluate everything objectively. I tried estimating the value of different outcomes. I tried to ascribe weights and calculate the value of things like network, branding, growth, faster promotion, potential for meeting co-founders, likelihood of IPOing. But nothing was convincing. It felt like an impossible choice. Before long it was Thursday night and I had to make a decision before the end of day Friday. There was a lot of cursing.

Google was assuring me that they'd raise their number by Friday morning. That night I couldn't sleep. I repeatedly got out of bed, pacing back and forth rehearsing conversations, frantically checking my e-mail and re-tweaking Excel models. What the fuck? Just a few weeks ago I could barely get anyone to look at my resume. My first offer barely cleared 120K. 220K? What on earth is Airbnb thinking??

That night and the following morning, I called up trusted friends and asked them what I should do. I was on the phone off and on for several hours through that morning. The consensus was overwhelming.

Everyone thought I should go with Airbnb.

## Final Hours

That morning, worn thin with sleep deprivation, I got a call from Google. They were raising the offer to 211K. That's 211K. Liquid. I'd receive all of that before a year's end. I remember scratching my chin and just laughing. God fucking dammit. I thanked my recruiter, and let her know I'd get back to her before the end of the day.

I knew Google would have a strong final offer, maybe upwards of 200K, but 211K was stronger than I'd expected. Still, it shouldn't sway my decision, right? Was this really a decision within a margin of 10K in EV? No one else seemed to think so. If Airbnb was the winner, it should still be the winner now.

Right?

I told myself: if I'm choosing Airbnb, just remember. 220K was their *initial* offer. That means there's money on the table. If there's one thing this job search had taught me, is that there's always, always more money on the table.

As an instructor at App Academy I ceaselessly pushed my students to negotiate hard, without fear of being rejected, looking stupid, or being perceived as greedy. Employers negotiate even harder and with more power behind them, and so it's up to candidates to tip the scales back in the direction of employees. As absurd as it seemed now, given an offer of 220K, I had to take my own advice and ask for more. I rehearsed it again and again in my head.

But if I'm going to ask for more, I shouldn't just ask for 10K more. I should expect to be met somewhere in the middle, right? I've got to be aggressive. But I don't have any stronger offers and they know that, so maybe it's stupid.

Fuck.

I called my recruiter from Airbnb and, half expecting to get laughed at, announced: &ldquo;If Airbnb can move up the RSUs by 30K to hit a total of 250K in all-in compensation, then I'll sign.&rdquo;

&ldquo;250K? Do I have your word?&rdquo; she said.

&ldquo;My word.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Okay. Let me see what I can do. I'll get back to you before evening.&rdquo;

The rest of the afternoon was a blur of habitually checking my phone, email, anything for some word of what would happen. I was driving my car into Austin, bumper-to-bumper in traffic when I got the phone call. It was the Airbnb recruiter.

&ldquo;Haseeb? This is Janice.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Janice! What's the word??&rdquo; I held my breath.

&ldquo;I made the magic happen. 250K. 130K salary, 25K signing, 95K a year in RSUs. So you're in?&rdquo;

I almost swerved into the car next to me from punching the air so hard.

&ldquo;I'm in.&rdquo;

So that's the story. I start on Monday.

## Overview

On the whole, I'm really excited to be joining the Airbnb family. It's definitely a different path than Google. Most significantly, there'll be less that I can donate to charity in a year's time. But not only is the total value of the assets greater, I'm also convinced that in the longer term, Airbnb will be the better move for my career.

Stock in a private company is of course still a valuable asset&mdash;I just won't be able to donate a third of their value until a liquidation event (hopefully an IPO). But my pledge to donate 1/3rd of all of my income, including my salary, doesn't change. Ultimately, this will be a better move in terms of EV, provided some discounting for the fact that I'll have to donate later in the future.

That said, the brand of the company was obviously an explicit consideration for me. From that perspective, my choice to join Airbnb might seem a little strange to some. In many parts of the world, Google and Airbnb wouldn't even be said in the same sentence. But within the SF ecosystem, Airbnb and Google are largely considered to be in the same tier of engineering organizations. I'd even argue that among certain crowds, Airbnb would be a stronger signal on one's resume than Google would be.

So I think, on the whole, I really got lucky with a company that's a perfect fit for what I'm looking for.

One other thing I want to add. I know some might think it's weird to be sharing your compensation in a public venue like this. I take my inspiration from [Jeff Kaufman](http://www.jefftk.com/donations) (who ironically works for Google, albeit in Boston), who donates 50% of his income to EA charities and catalogues it publicly every year.

The norm of keeping compensation secret is a very American one. And I think on the whole, it stifles transparency and open dialogue about things like class and economic inequality. But more poignantly, it makes it harder to be transparent and galvanizing about earning-to-give, which is very much one of my goals.

I explicitly entered into tech a year ago because I believed it was a place where I'd be uniquely well-suited to create a lot of value. It's an industry where smart, driven young people can quickly earn an outsized income. Seeing that opportunity, I decided to pivot into tech and make building a career here an active aim of my life. And I hope to, as long as I can, continue to speak openly about my compensation and give even more of it away.

So that's enough of soapboxing. Here are some stats.

## A Few Statistics

By the end of my process, I had received a total of 8 job offers (not including re-negotiation with App Academy). I had completed 12 onsites total, so my I had a total onsite-to-offer rate of 66%.

Considering only the onsites after receiving my first offer however, my onsite-to-offer rate was 87%.

Of my offers, 2 of them were through TripleByte (one from TripleByte itself, the other, Gusto, through their introduction). The remainder were through referrals. Two of the 6 referrals were non-engineering referrals.

There were 12 companies where I was referred but did not receive an offer. 25% of the companies I was referred to didn't even talk to me. But that was a lot better than the base rate: overall, 53% of companies I applied to through any means rejected me without even talking to me.

In the end, I didn't get a single offer through a raw application. Every single offer came through a referral of some kind. (This I did not expect, and strongly influences the advice I'd give to a job-seeker.)

The differential between my lowest (initial) offer and my highest (final) offer was, in total value, an increase of 104%. That is, my compensation literally more than doubled by not accepting my first job offer. (I expect this to be highly anomalous, since companies had a lot of discrepancies in where they leveled me on their engineering ladders.)

The largest percentage increase was also with my lowest initial offer, Yelp. They started at a total annualized value of 122.5K (105K salary + 17.5K stock), and their final offer was at a total value of 180K, an increase of $57.5K, or 47%. Again, I expect this to be anomalous, because I literally jumped in engineering levels (they initially offered me a junior role, then re-evaluated). The second largest increase was from Google, moving up $48.6K for an increase of 30%. This one is perhaps less anomalous. I'm not sure.

On all but two of my offers, I negotiated. The average delta for company offers at which I negotiated was +$30,671 for the final offer. So, negotiation pays, boys and girls. More on that later.

In total, I received offers from Airbnb, Youtube (Google subsidiary), Uber, Twitch (Amazon subsidiary), Yelp, Stripe, Gusto, and TripleByte. The average value of the final offers was approximately $193,600. The salaries were all approximately the same at $130K. (Only one company offered me a base salary of $125K.) I should also note that I negotiated more aggressively on RSUs and signing bonus. I'll also talk more about that later.

There's obviously a lot in this department, but this blog post is already long enough. I'm going to write one more post before I start at Airbnb this coming Monday: my key takeaways from this job search, and advice to current job seekers. I'll also talk more about my thoughts on negotiation in that upcoming post.

Look forward to it!

### Update (4/25/2016)

This post has gotten a lot of unexpected attention, so I want to clarify a couple things.

First (and this should go without saying), everything mentioned in my story are my own thoughts and words, and though I am employed by Airbnb, I in no way speak on their behalf. (It's legally important to say that, I guess.)

That said, I realize that pay transparency is a controversial subject, and I seem to have stirred up a hornet's nest. So I want to make clear a few things.

Many people seem to think that publicly disclosing your compensation is a fireable offense, and that Airbnb will fire me now that they see I've posted this. Neither of those statements are true.

It's explicitly illegal under the National Labor Relations Act to fire workers for discussing their compensations, and it has been illegal in American law since 1935. This kind of policy is known as &ldquo;Pay Secrecy,&rdquo; and such policies have been repeatedly struck down by courts.

See: [Pay Secrecy Policies at Work are Often Illegal and Misunderstood](http://www.npr.org/2014/04/13/301989789/pay-secrecy-policies-at-work-often-illegal-and-misunderstoo).

And yet, pay secrecy is considered the norm in American culture.

There was a time in American history when income tax records were in the public domain. Even now, there are many cultures in which talking about your compensation is not at all considered wrong or disrespectful. Rather, it's seen as an important part of creating a transparent society.

Pay secrecy is an easy fallback, because talking about social inequality and pay differentials is uncomfortable. It's especially uncomfortable in American culture, where your salary often serves as a signal of your social status.

But pay secrecy carries with it a lot of costs. It can hide gender and racial discrimination, systemic exploitation, and nepotism. It's easy to sweep these problems under the rug and not want to look at them. And for what it's worth, I have a lot of respect to Airbnb for openly working toward solving these problems in the culture they're building.

These are complicated problems. I don't have all the answers. But because I am committed to effective altruism and publicly earning-to-give, I will continue to be open every year about how much I donate (and by association, how much I earn), insofar as it's possible.

(For further reading, check out [Your Coworkers Should Know Your Salary](https://hbr.org/ideacast/2016/03/your-coworkers-should-know-your-salary), published in the Harvard Business Review. Also, [my response to a commenter on how disclosing my salary might be unwise or affect colleagues at Airbnb](https://haseebq.com/farewell-app-academy-hello-airbnb-part-ii/#comment-2738).)

The second thing I want to say is that for some reason, many people are drawing the conclusion that I primarily got a job at Airbnb by being really good at negotiating, or gaming the system, or something like that.

**If you have ever done a software engineering interview, you would know that this is completely absurd.** There is no way to negotiate or charm someone into passing a software engineering interview. Much less 8 of them.

If you don't know the ins and outs of object-oriented programming, database design, asymptotic analysis, binary search trees, or how to improve the cache efficiency of an algorithm, then you're not going to pass a computer science-heavy interview at a top company. You don't even have a shot at it.

The moral of my story is **not** &ldquo;get really good at negotiating and you'll get a great job.&rdquo; Negotiating is important, and I certainly encourage everyone to negotiate!

But first, get good at the thing you're doing. Then worry about negotiating.

I moved to San Francisco from Austin, Texas about a year ago because I decided I was going to [earn-to-give](https://haseebq.com/why-ive-decided-to-devote-my-career-to-earning-to-give/). Since then I've been relentlessly trying to build a new career for myself, so I could earn more and donate more to charity.

Entering into App Academy, barely knowing the basics of Ruby, I came into the office and grinded every day, spending 80+ hour weeks just coding and studying. I'd come in at 9AM in the morning and leave around midnight, 7 days a week, sleeping in a bunk bed in SOMA in a 200 square feet shared room.

It's certainly true that I probably have a mind that's well-suited for coding. But it's also true that I outworked almost everyone who was in my cohort. And when I was hired by App Academy to help teach the course, I continued working as hard as I could to get good at this.

I still stayed late in the evenings, I still came into the office on weekends alongside the students just to continue coding and learning more. I started an algorithms study group in the evenings where I taught students new algorithms that I had read about, and wrote specs and instructions to guide them through the implementation. I took over our entire algorithms curriculum and taught well over 100 students the basics of data structures and algorithms.

And of course, I was scared that none of this would matter. That having been an English major, having a non-traditional background, being 26 and too old to transition into tech, competing against 20 year olds who'd been coding since they were 10, I thought I must have no chance.

Thankfully, I was wrong. And I'm very, very lucky that I was wrong, because I was almost right.

So if there's one takeaway I want people to have, it's not &ldquo;here's why it pays to be a master negotiator.&rdquo; I'm going to talk a lot more about negotiation advice in my next blog post, but that's almost a detail compared to the larger point.

The real takeaway should be: *get so good that they can't ignore you.* Because once you are, they won't.

title: How to Break Into the Tech Industry—a Guide to Job Hunting and Tech Interviews
tags: [tech careers]
image: coding-924920_960_720_wtwest.jpg
---

I recently completed a job search for my first role as a software engineer.

Despite having first learned how to code almost a year before, having a background as an English major and former professional poker player, I was able to land a total of 8 offers including Google, Uber, Yelp, and Airbnb (where I ultimately joined). In this three-part blog post I'm going to describe my advice to a job-seeker trying to break into the tech industry.

If you haven't read the story of my job search, [you can read about it here]( https://haseebq.com/farewell-app-academy-hello-airbnb-part-i/). It provides some of the backdrop for this post.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DgcI0mQXATI/">[video]</div>

First, several caveats.

I have a weird background, but make no mistake&mdash;I both worked my ass off and got very lucky. When I got my job offers, I was working as an instructor and Director of Product of App Academy, and had been studying (and teaching) this stuff for a little under a year.

In light of that, some people have interpreted this as a &ldquo;get rich quick&rdquo; sort of thing. It's not. It's more of a a &ldquo;go into a cave for six months and hopefully get a job when you emerge&rdquo; sort of thing. Subtle difference, but an important one.

Note that my advice here draws not just from my own experience, but also from the advice of many others. It also comes from observing the job searches of 200+ App Academy students breaking into the tech industry.

That said, take all of my advice with a grain of salt. There are people out there who are much more successful than I, and who know much more about this domain. So if you find there's some aspect of my advice that seems flat-out wrong or contradicted by others, defer to your own judgment.

I entered into tech so that I could [earn-to-give](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earning_to_give). My hope is that in supplying this advice, I will encourage and enable others to do the same.

I've broken this up into three parts: getting interviews, the interview process, and negotiating. This post will cover the first two parts, and I'll conclude with a lot of advice about the negotiation process in a subsequent post.

Note: this advice will be primarily geared toward the software engineer market in the Bay Area, but a lot of the advice will be generally applicable. When I mention &ldquo;engineering,&rdquo; just substitute your own field. Though the details might be different, the underlying dynamics are largely the same.

I hope you find this post helpful in your own job search.

<h2 id="part1">Part 1: Job Hunting</h2>

First and foremost, job hunting is a numbers game. You must have faith in the numbers.

If I told you that you have a 4% chance of getting an offer from any application, that might seem dishearteningly low. But mathematically that means that 50 such applications will give you an 87% chance of getting at least one job offer.

And yet, any given application is almost certainly not going to be the one that ends up turning into an offer.

That's okay. Expect those dynamics. It's weird and counterintuitive, but you should probably expect the company that ultimately gives you an offer to seem like a long shot. This is because almost every application will seem like a long shot.

Be comfortable with that. Trust in the law of large numbers.

This applies to networking, raw applications, even to phone screens and on-sites.

### Networking

Networking is probably the highest leverage activity in getting job offers.

Networking sounds intimidating. But I promise you, at its heart, it's pretty simple.

Just buy everyone coffee.

And when I say everyone, I mean everyone who works at a tech company.

Every time you meet someone in tech, and I mean anyone at all, you should tell them, &ldquo;Hey, that's really cool. I'm actually trying to get a job as a software engineer. I don't know very much about [the thing you do]. I'd love to buy you coffee and pick your brain about it. Are you free sometime this week around [time]?&rdquo;

Buy tons and tons of coffee for people. Do it religiously and have no shame about it. I don't care if you can't afford it. Go broke inviting people to coffee.

In fact, if you go broke, let me know and I'll fund your coffee dates until you land an awesome job and can pay me back.

How do you meet tech people in the first place? Go to [meetups](https://meetup.com). Go to local events. Go to developer conferences. Go to house parties. (Techies are normal people, and people are everywhere.)

Get creative. @Message people on Twitter. Cold-email them (specific people, not companies). Don't be creepy, but it's totally okay to reach out to people out of the blue, learn about them online, and ask directly if you can buy them coffee.

Most importantly, *plumb your network*. Chances are, you have friends or friends of friends who already work at tech companies. You're just not paying attention.

Okay.

So now you've got a bunch of coffee dates lined up with all these random people who work for tech companies. Some of them might be engineers, or managers, operations, designers, customer support, salespeople. Doesn't matter. Meet anyone and everyone.

Once you've sat someone down for coffee, it's time for an **[informational interview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informational_interview)**.

### Informational Interviewing

Here's what you do in an informational interview.

First, learn everything and anything you can about this person. Learn everything you can about their company. Learn everything you can about the industry or technology they work with.

Notice I didn't say &ldquo;ask for a job.&rdquo; **Don't ask for a job.** This is not about you asking for a job. This is about everything other than you asking for a job.

Get to know them! Get to know their company! Learn more about what they do and why it's important. Ask things you really want to know.

They should be doing most of the talking, otherwise you're doing it wrong. Shut up and ask more questions.

Chances are, if you shut up for long enough, they'll be curious about you and want to know what you're doing. Tell them your story. Tell them about who you are, what brought you here, and why you want a job as a software engineer.

At the end of the conversation, go for the close&mdash;which, most of the time, is not to ask for a job referral. **Do not ask for a referral unless they bring it up.** Rather, ask them: &ldquo;who else do you know who'd be a good person for me to talk to?&rdquo; Tell them you want to learn more about front-end development, or cryptography, or iOS, or whatever you were asking them questions about.

You *were* asking them questions, right?

If they can't think of anyone to pass you along to, ask them if they know any other engineers anywhere you could talk to. Or anyone at all who works at another tech company you're interested in. Whatever it is, get contacts for more people to get introduced to. Every conversation should lead to at least one more contact.

Then, just keep following this chain. Schedule more coffee dates, ask more questions, get more contacts. Go through all of it without asking for any unsolicited referrals.

This might seem weird. But studies have shown that this is the most effective way to get a job. And ultimately, it's the most effective way to generate referrals outside of your network.

Why does this work?

It works because people **hate it** when you ask them for a job.

Give you a job? Why? They don't know you. Why would they give you a job? Why would they even waste their time on you?

The power of informational interviewing is that instead of making it about you, *you make it about them*. People like to talk about themselves. They like to teach others. They want to help. But they don't want to be pestered by strangers for favors.

If you keep doing this, people will see your curiosity and your genuineness. They'll believe in your story, and *they will want to refer you*. By not pressuring people to recommend you, you will make them want to do so&mdash;or, at the very least, become an ally in your journey.

The reality is, most people *can't* refer you. This is because their company might be too small to hire junior devs, or they might not need people with your skillset, or they might have overhired for the quarter, or, believe it or not, their company could just be secretly failing and not have any money.

That's okay.

If you do this enough times, someone will eventually float the idea: &ldquo;I could refer you if you want.&rdquo;

If they say this, graciously ask them if they'd be comfortable doing so. They'll then say yes. Now say &ldquo;golly gee, that would be swell.&rdquo; Then follow up with them over e-mail, thank them, and send them your resume. Congrats, you've just landed yourself a referral.

See? That wasn't so hard.

Now keep them posted on your progress through their company's pipeline. Don't hesitate to also ask them for further advice.

Oh, and, before you leave that coffee date, still ask them for more contacts. I mean it. The chain stops for no one.

### Getting the Chain Started

But how do you start the chain?

Chances are, you already have contacts in the tech industry. Even if you think you don't, you probably do. Go scour your LinkedIn, your Facebook, ask your family, talk to people you kinda knew in high school. Nothing is off limits.

Make a spreadsheet of every single person you know who works for a tech company. Mark down what company they work for, and what their role is at that company.

Then sort all of your contacts by company, and then by role. You should reach out to your most relevant contact at every single company on your list (an engineer is more relevant than someone in operations, etc).

**Reach out to every single one.**

Invite them to coffee, lunch, dinner, whatever. Always buy. Farm them for referrals and further contacts. If you have a strong network, this is likely to be the most powerful source of leads for you.

This is great, because unless you have a stellar resume (which I assume you don't because you're bothering to read this guide), referrals are going to be an order of magnitude more impactful than raw applications. This is especially true at top companies.

So keep your funnel healthy. Keep scheduling coffee dates. Keep networking, even if you're mid-way through your job search. I didn't stop meeting with people until I had about 4 offers, and even then I still reached out to people at new companies I was interested in.

### Resumes and Cover Letter

I'm not going to offer a lot of specific advice here, because there's so much to say and it's so individual to your background and experience. [Scour](https://www.resumonk.com/blog/dear-software-engineer-this-is-why-your-resume-was-rejected/) [the](https://www.resumonk.com/resume-examples/software-engineer-resume-examples/software-engineer-sample-resume-%231) [internet](https://jsonresume.org/schema/) for resources. I'd strongly recommend getting your resume reviewed by someone who knows what they're doing.

Resume short version: keep your resume to one page, always. Highlight anything that sounds kinda math-y or technical. Measure everything in terms of impact, don't just describe your responsibilities. Make your resume pretty, especially if you're claiming to be a front-end or full-stack developer. Don't use Arial or Times New Roman. A little bit of design effort will go a long way. [Never, ever have typos](http://blog.alinelerner.com/lessons-from-a-years-worth-of-hiring-data/).

Some people read cover letters, some people don't. You usually need to write one, and you'll likely end up coming up with a script that you adapt. Always personalize them&mdash;try to find some reason why you like the company's mission or find their work interesting. Keep it short, and minimize the cruft. If you need more advice, there's no shortage out there on the internet for cover letter advice.

### Job Platforms

Get on all the job hiring platforms. The first job offers I got were from [TripleByte](https://triplebyte.com), which I cannot recommend highly enough for software engineers.

Also set up a profile on [AngelList](http://angel.co), [WhiteTruffle](https://www.whitetruffle.com/), [SmartHires](https://www.smarthires.io/), and all the rest. Apply to [Hired](https://hired.com). Clean up your LinkedIn and Github profiles. Get your projects up and README'd and pretty.

Even if some of these platforms reject you or you don't get any bites, they're enormous return on investment for the time you'll spend.

### Mass Applying

Referrals and job platforms are unequivocally higher-yield strategies, but you shouldn't ignore raw applications. This is especially true if you have a strong resume, as you're likely to have a higher reply rate. Raw applications are low investment, so you might as well pump them out in your free time and maximize the number of potential bites. They are also the primary way I've seen most App Academy students get jobs, so they certainly work. But they require more volume.

I recommend most people mix in some mass applying into their strategy.

You should pre-commit to a number of companies to apply to per day.

Mass applying to companies is really mind-numbing. It's easy to lose focus. So structure your time and set goals for yourself. Apply to batches of companies in 45-minute sprints. Use [Pomodoros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) to keep yourself on point and accountable.

### Company Size

From my observations, small-medium size companies are more likely to take a chance on a raw application.

Large and prestigious companies tend to have rigid resume review processes, and are more likely to trash your resume if it's not studded with exciting phrases like &ldquo;Stanford PhD&rdquo; or &ldquo;literally a superhero.&rdquo;

Tiny companies are hit-or-miss.

Shoot for unsexy companies. You're much more likely to get an interview, and at this stage, getting interview experience under your belt is ultimately what matters.

Understand: just having your first offer matters much more than where the offer is from. Even if the offer is from a company you're not excited about, you can easily leverage it up to a company you want more. More on this later when we talk about negotiation.

### Study, study, study

This is perhaps the most important piece, and where a lot of the hustle comes in. You need to study your ass off. Your study habits are one of the chief determinants of your performance in interviews (not to mention your performance in your subsequent job).

You're trying to break into this field, so break in!

Below, I'm going to give my general advice to someone aiming for a role as a full-stack or back-end developer. If you want to get a job doing front-end development, game development, embedded systems, or anything sufficiently specialized, you should look up more specific advice for those fields.

This is the preparation that I personally used. My approach to studying has been informed by my knowledge of performance psychology and by the science of learning. But your mileage may vary.

I'm going to assume you already know how to program. If you don't at all, [read this instead as a first step](https://haseebq.com/cracking-the-coding-bootcamp-the-definitive-guide/).

I should also note that the following advice is strongly tailored toward interviews at larger, more prestigious companies. At smaller companies, your interview is less likely to consist of abstract algorithms problems. You may have to do raw coding exercises, fix a bug in production code, or build a small semi-practical system. It's also more likely you'll be asked questions about specific languages or frameworks. I ran into a few of these interviews, but only at smaller companies. Adjust your study plan accordingly.

Disclaimer: a common refrain in tech is that &ldquo;programming interviews are broken.&rdquo; I agree. I think standard tech interviews are poor predictors of software engineering ability. But like any good hacker, I designed this advice to be a reverse-engineering of the standard programming interview. Take it for what it is, and no more.

### General Study Strategy

First, a high-level roadmap.

Watch the [Princeton Coursera course on algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI) (by Robert Sedgewick), mostly up until Dijkstra's algorithm and not much more than that. Try to follow along and code as you go. You don't need to implement things in Java unless you already know Java.

Read [The Algorithm Design Manual](http://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1462241467&sr=8-1&keywords=algorithm+design+manual+skiena&tag=charity48-20) for general algorithms and data structures background. Go through most of it. (You can skip the giant appendix about specific algorithmic topics).

Buy [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Programming/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1462241515&sr=8-1&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview&tag=charity48-20). We'll be using this as a repository of coding problems and solutions.

Listen regularly to podcasts about software like [Software Engineering Daily](http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/podcast/) or [The Bike Shed](http://bikeshed.fm/). Read [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). There's a lot of stuff you won't understand, but that's okay. Just soak it in. Over time, this will give you some familiarity with modern web stacks, current trends, and how developers talk.

For system design and architecture, I recommend reading through [HiredInTech](http://www.hiredintech.com/system-design) and reading a bunch of the top blog posts on [High Scalability](http://highscalability.com/all-time-favorites/) (appears to be down at the time of posting). There's also a massive [Github repo of resources](https://github.com/checkcheckzz/system-design-interview) you can check out specifically for systems design interviews.

If you already know a programming language, do your practicing in whatever language you know best. Interviewers won't care. If you have a choice among languages, prefer expressive scripting languages like Ruby, Python, JavaScript, etc. More on this later when we talk about interview advice.

Object oriented design and code organization are very important concepts, and they'll come up in interviews. Unfortunately, there's pretty much no way to learn them other than by just writing lots of well-structured programs, and getting critiques and code reviews.

If you have no programming background at all, this is one of the places where a (good) coding bootcamp helps tremendously. They will give you a lot of experience just writing programs and being critiqued on your coding style. But there are always online communities where you can find substitutes, such as on [Stack Exchange](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/).

If you're struggling to understand a concept in a book or on Wikipedia, look up Youtube videos of people explaining it in different ways until you get it. I've found this strategy amazingly effective.

Ask human beings for help when you're struggling. If you don't know anyone, get on StackOverflow or find a good IRC channel for the language you're working in. Be a burden on others. Ask quickly and unashamedly. You have my permission.

If you're working on an algorithms problem (such as out of CTCI) and can't figure it out, spend no more than 20-30 minutes without making progress. Just go look up the answer. Contrary to popular belief, most struggling past 30 minutes is pointless.

Some people will disagree with this.

Screw those people.

That said, if you find up having to look up the answer to more than 2/3rds of problems, your problem set is too hard and you need to downgrade.

But banging your head against a wall or staring blankly at code is a waste of time. For code/algorithms problems, you very much want to maximize the density of learning per hour.

Any time you look up the answer to a coding problem, try to understand the solution. Walk through it with a debugger if it's particularly mysterious. Read multiple explanations of why it works.

Then&mdash;and this is **extremely** important&mdash;if you didn't solve the problem completely on your own, treat the problem as though you never solved it at all. Put it back into your rotation of problems. Mark it as something you need to try again from scratch. Wait at least a day, and try to solve it fresh. If you fail, rinse and repeat ad infinitum.

And finally, structure the hell out of your learning. Make a schedule. Know exactly when you're going to be working on this stuff, when you're going to take breaks, when you're going to go to lunch, etc. Build flexibility into your schedule, but have clear goals for how many hours a day you'll spend studying.

That's most of my general studying advice. Now here's the specific study guide I'd recommend.

### Programming Interview Study Guide

First and foremost, work through the Princeton algorithms course. You should follow along and implement as much as you can. Along the way, also implement all these major data structures. (Many of these are not explicitly covered in the course&mdash;implement them on your own).

* Linked List
* [Dynamic array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array), implemented with a [ring buffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer) (use a statically sized array underneath the hood)
* Hash set
* [Hash map (with chaining)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#Separate_chaining_with_linked_lists)
* Binary heap (without decrease-key; know that [Fibonacci heaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_heap) exist and know their guarantees)
* Binary search tree (doesn't need to be self-balancing; know that [self-balancing trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_binary_search_tree#Implementations) exist and know their guarantees)
* Prefix tree (a.k.a. trie)
* Suffix tree (don't worry about compression, just build a dumb version; know that [Ukkonen's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukkonen%27s_algorithm) exists and learn its guarantees)
* An object-oriented [adjacency list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list) for graphs

Know all of the time complexities for their basic operations. It helps to visually intuit them. Look at images. Draw them out on paper/whiteboard.

Once you've gotten all of those out of the way, implement this subset of the most common algorithms:

* Binary search (implement it both iteratively and recursively)
* Randomized quicksort (pay extra attention to the partition subroutine, as it's useful in a lot of places)
* Mergesort
* Breadth-first search in a graph
* Depth-first search in a graph (augment it to detect cycles)
* Tree traversals (pre-order, in-order, post-order)
* Topological sort (using [Tarjan's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#Depth-first_search))
* Dijkstra's algorithm ([without decrease-key](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9255620/why-does-dijkstras-algorithm-use-decrease-key))
* Longest common subsequence (using dynamic programming with matrices)
* Knapsack problem (also dynamic programming)

Know the time complexities and space complexities of all of these algorithms ([cheat-sheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)). Know the difference between [amortized, average](http://stackoverflow.com/a/7335098), and worst-case time guarantees.

Do at least one or two problems where you BFS or DFS through a matrix.

Once you finish these you should have a decent grounding in algorithms and data structures. Read through the entirety of *Algorithm Design Manual* to solidify your understanding. Implement anything that you find sufficiently interesting.

A few points of interest: learn about heap sort, but don't bother coding it. Know that it's O(1) space but practically very slow due to cache-inefficiency. Learn about quickselect and median-of-medians. Code them if you want.

Learn the basics of bit manipulation. Be able to explain what AND, OR, and XOR do. Know what a signed integer is. Know that there are 8 bits in a byte. Know what assembly is (from a high level), and get a sense of the basic operations that hardware exposes. [This awesome video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZUDEaLa5Nw) about the inner workings of the original Game Boy covers just about all you need to know.

Learn about SQL databases. Learn how to design a SQL database schema; it comes up in interviews often. Read about ACID, the CAP theorem, and BASE (you don't need to memorize the terms, just understand the concepts at a high level.) Understand why joins can become unscalable. Learn the basics of [NoSQL databases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI_g07C_Q5I).

Read about caches and cache efficiency. Know what a cache miss is. Know that reading from registers is lightning-fast, reading from the various caches is pretty fast, reading from memory is slow, and that reading from the hard disk is abysmally slow.

Read how to implement an LRU cache, and then actually write one that gets and sets in worst-case O(1) time. This is a weirdly common interview problem.

[Learn what happens when you type a URL into your browser and press enter](http://igoro.com/archive/what-really-happens-when-you-navigate-to-a-url/comment-page-3/). Be comfortable talking about DNS lookups, the request-response cycle, HTTP verbs, TCP vs UDP, and how cookies work. Shows up all the time in interviews.

Learn the standard ways to speed up a slow website. This includes a lot of things like adding database indices to optimize common queries, better caching, loading front-end assets from a CDN, cleaning up zombie listeners, etc. Also an interview classic, pretty rabbit-holey.

(These last two are obviously web development specific.)

Once you've covered those, you now have most of the grounding you need. You should be ready to start interview circuit training.

(If you already have a background in CS, I'd probably start here.)

### Interview Circuit Training

First, work through the first 3 problems on every relevant section of *Cracking the Coding Interview*. (That is, skip sections like Java or C++ if you don't know those languages, skip testing, skip concurrency unless you have experience writing concurrent programs. Do read about it though.)

Write out your solutions in code. Make sure they work. Check edge cases.

After you've written a good 30+ solutions, stop coding every single solution. By now you should have some solid coding practice, and you should be developing your high-level intuition how to determine the optimal approach to a problem. The rest is pattern recognition.

Continue working through the rest of *Cracking the Coding Interview*. But from here on out, instead of actually writing code, just write a high-level description of the algorithm you'd use to solve the problem.

Here's an example of what I mean: &ldquo;First sort the array, then repeatedly binary search through it on each subsequent query. This should take nlog(n) pre-processing and log(n) for each query.&rdquo;

That's enough detail. Once you've written your high-level solution, check it against the solution in the book. If your solution is suboptimal, write a description of the optimal solution. Make sure it makes sense to you. If it even *slightly* doesn't make sense and you're not confident you could write the code, then code it up, test for edge cases, etc.

With this workflow, you should be coding only a small percentage of the remaining problems. You should be able to work through many more problems a day now.

Make sure you have your solutions collected into files so that you can review them easily. In your solutions files, you should also have the problem statement along with any solution you have written/described.

Whenever you review them (which you should at weekly intervals), here's how you should review: read the problem statement only, decide how you'd solve the problem in your head, and then check it against the algorithm you have written down. Again, reaffirm to yourself why the correct answer is correct.

Once you make it through the entire book, spend the remainder of your study time grinding problems on [LeetCode](http://leetcode.com).

LeetCode is an online coding platform like HackerRank or CodeWars that gives you a problem statement and lets you write code against test cases.

I recommend LeetCode particularly because it has the most accurate problem set I've seen for what most algorithms interviews are like. It also has an awesome feature that it tags programming problems by companies where the problem was asked. (If the company has fewer than 2000 employees, then it's unlikely to be tagged anywhere.)

So any time you have an interview at a big company, do every single problem that company is tagged with on LeetCode. You have to pay for a subscription to see the tags, but it's worth it.

GlassDoor is also a good source of company-specific problems to grind on. (You can also try CareerCup, but their accuracy tends to be a bit more dubious.)

After all that, there's one last piece that's missing&mdash;actual interview practice. One of the chief principles of learning is *practice like performance*. That is, make the way you practice as close to the actual performance as possible. In this case, the actual performance will be standing in front of a whiteboard and getting verbally interviewed by someone.

Practice for it.

Find someone to mock-interview you in front of a whiteboard (and reciprocate for them afterward). Have them ask you questions you've never seen before. Practice all of your interviewing skills, including introducing yourself, clarifying the problem, making jokes, everything that you plan to do in a real interview. Treat it as though it's the real thing. Be willing to struggle and look stupid. Don't let yourself break character.

This is also really the only way to practice architecture-oriented interviews. Have your interviewer ask you about the request-response cycle or how you'd architect Twitter, or other standard interview favorites.

A great resource is [interviewing.io](http://interviewing.io/), which allows you to anonymously interview and get interviewed by other people and practice programming problems. They're in private beta right now, but check them out.

If you actually implement every part of this workflow, you should become an algorithms beast within a few months. Your performance on a coding interview will be comparable if not superior to the average CS graduate.

There's nothing magical about any of this. It's all just practice. All of the information you need to pass a coding interview is out there, freely available. It's up to you to put the time in.

Okay.

You're clearly awesome at algorithms now, so let's keep going.

### Staying the Path

Job searching is hard. Once you start applying to companies, you're going to get many, many rejections.

Struggling for months and getting rejected everywhere is deeply demoralizing.

It's going to feel like it's your fault. It's going to feel like something is wrong with you.

That's exactly how my job search began. The same is true for many people I know who landed awesome jobs. Almost everyone goes through this.

There are a couple stories I like to share with App Academy students.

I once worked with an App Academy student who didn't have a degree; he'd dropped out of college. He was job searching for 11 months and had submitted hundreds of applications. He was ready to completely give up on ever finding a job. But with some support and coaching, he was able to get his first offer at a startup. After some negotiating, that offer ended up being the second highest offer any student has ever received in App Academy history.

Another student I worked with had a similar story. 11 months of nothing but rejections after hundreds of applications. After getting some support, he finally received his first and only offer, and it was from Uber. He's still working there.

The moral of this story is: hang in there. Keep grinding. Remember that it's a numbers game. Keep putting yourself out there, and most importantly, keep taking care of yourself.

The simple stuff is important. It'll sound stupid, but focus on self-care before anything else in the job search.

Do things that de-stress you, whether that be meditation, taking baths, playing video games, whatever. Spend time with friends. Eat good, real food.

Make sure you're sleeping. The marginal hour spent sleeping is almost always more useful than the marginal hour spent working.

Get regular exercise, even if you don't want to and hate everything about it. Countless studies have shown that exercise is basically a panacea. It boosts personal well-being more than any other psychological intervention, including anti-depressants.

Depression will creep up on you.

If it does, notice that it's there. Talk to people about it. Don't be ashamed. Fight it actively. Exercise and Vitamin D are your allies. Spend time outside, in the sun. See a professional if you need it.

But your best defense is structuring your time. Religiously schedule yourself. Know what you should be doing everyday.

In many ways, freedom is your enemy. Let structure be your shelter.

### Mindset

I used to work as a mental coach for professional poker players, as well as other folks in high-stakes professions. A lot of that work has informed my approach to job searching.

Here's my advice on mindset.

First and foremost, treat everything as a learning experience. By that I mean, don't ever go into a phone screen or an onsite interview hoping for a job. Don't hope for anything at all. Just go there to learn, to mess up, to try things out and see what this whole interviewing thing is all about.

I'd almost say&mdash;imagine someone else was invited to this interview, and you're merely their doppelganger. You get to be a fly on the wall, try things out, but you don't really care whether they get hired or not. You're just doing it because it's interesting. And why not get more experience interviewing?

Treat every interview like this. Stop caring about the outcome. Don't hope to get hired at all, just go in there and learn.

This approach will have tremendously beneficial effects for you as a candidate. You won't be so damn nervous or terrified. You'll be less attached to the outcome and won't be crushed if you don't get the job. (Almost never does a candidate pass their first couple interviews, so you should expect that anyway.) And it makes the entire process more fun and easier to actually learn from.

The second big piece of advice is: continually set goals for yourself. But only set goals that are completely in your control.

For example, a goal like &ldquo;I want to have a job offer by January 20th&rdquo; is a terrible goal. It's not up to you. How would you even know if you're making incremental progress toward this? You'll either have a job before then or you won't.

Instead, choose goals about your own behavior. A goal like &ldquo;I want to apply to 4 jobs every weekday,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I want to ask 4 people for coffee dates every week&rdquo; are completely in your control and easy to measure.

The third and final piece of advice is on how to frame your job search. Here's a little parable I used to tell my students.

### Your Number

Imagine that somewhere, in God's Database, is a number. That number is the number of days you're going to have to work your ass off until you find a job.

Everyone has their own number in God's database. Even you.

Let's call your number N.

Every day you spend seriously job searching decrements that N by 1. You don't know what that N is of course. And you'll never know what N is until you finally get your first offer. (Assume God [sanitizes his inputs against SQL injections](https://xkcd.com/327/).)

You don't get to choose your N. Many things affect the size of your N&mdash;your experience, your education, your network, systemic biases in the industry, and some randomness. A shitload of randomness, actually.

Other people will have smaller Ns than you, even though they're not as skilled as you are. That's okay.

Ignore other people. They have it easier, and that's fine. But your N is already decided, and your only job is to whittle that N down.

So treat every day as progress. Whether you get rejected from a company, whether you screw up an interview, whether you get inexplicably lowballed, it doesn't matter. That N is getting lower and lower, and your interviewing skills are getting better and better. Be confident. You're getting closer.

Every single day is progress.

And, lastly&hellip;

### Keep Having Fun

This is really important.

Keep making things. Keep working on projects. Find things that excite you. Learn new technologies, frameworks, algorithms, languages. When someone asks you &ldquo;what are you working on lately?&rdquo; you should have a good answer&mdash;one that excites you.

Work on things that are actually fun. It'll keep you sharp, motivated, and happy.

You're breaking into this industry because you want to program, right?

So keep programming!

----

<h2 id="part2">Part 2: The Interview Process</h2>

Okay. You did all of part 1 and you've got interviews lined up. Great. Now what?

 I'm going to reiterate this again: approach every interview as a learning experience. Stop caring whether you'll get the job or not. The first few times, you'll almost certainly bomb. It's okay. Expect that and roll with it.

Interviewing is a skill, and not a particularly mysterious one. Trust that the more times you do it and the more deliberately you analyze your mistakes, the better you'll get at it.

Don't worry about getting a job. Each interview probably won't be the one that leads to a job. That's okay. Just learn and have fun. You'll perform much better that way.

### The Basics

So your interview is coming up.

If you are uncertain about anything in particular, know that you can ask your recruiter or point of contact at the company. You can ask them things like: What sort of problems will be on the interview? Anything specific I should review? Can I use Python? Will there be any pair programming? Should I bring my own laptop for coding? Will I be able to Google documentation during the interview?

These are all totally fine questions. Nobody will care at all if you ask. I've seen many people agonize over questions like these. Just ask.

Some basics:

At a tech startup in the Bay, dress nicely, but casual. Something like a sweater or button-up and jeans works well. In more conservative markets, wear a dress shirt and slacks. If you're not sure, ask your recruiter. This is in no way a taboo question.

They'll often offer you something to drink. Take it if you want it. Use their bathroom. Do whatever you can to make yourself relaxed.

When you meet your interviewer, say hello, introduce yourself. Relax. Try to remember their name. (No big deal if you don't.)

There's always some ritual to beginning an interview. It's not too complicated.

Your interviewer will walk in the room. Smile. Tell her your name. Shake hands confidently. Look her in the eye.

Adopt relaxed body language. Lean back in your chair. Try not to fidget&mdash;just clasp your hands together if you can't help it.

You're completely fine. This interview is just for practice anyway. Don't analyze yourself. No, it's not weird that your arms are dangling like that.

Ask your interviewer what team she's on and what she's been working on lately. This will get the conversation flowing.

If you're nervous, it's okay to tell them that. If you're eager to get started, it's also okay to tell them that.

### Talking About Yourself

When it comes to talking about yourself, most tech interviews are incredibly formulaic.

Almost every question you'll be asked will be a permutation of one of these four:

* What's your story / walk me through your resume / why'd you leave your last job? (these are essentially the same question)
* Why us?
* Tell me about a challenging bug you faced and how you solved it.
* Tell me about an interesting project you worked on.

The first question is particularly important. Essentially, they want to hear your personal narrative. Your answer will strongly influence their perception of you.

This really just comes down to storytelling. Consider yourself a character in a story, and structure the story with a beginning, middle, and end. There should be inflection points, characterization, and easy to understand motivations. Keep it as short as possible, while preserving color and what makes you interesting. Try not to be negative. Frame your story around seeking challenge and wanting to better yourself, rather than rejecting or disliking things.

You will tell this narrative again and again. If you interview enough, eventually it will congeal into a script. The best way to improve at it is to literally practice it out loud and listen to a recording of it. Also try to get feedback from someone whose judgment you trust, and ask them to be as ruthlessly critical as possible.

For the remaining three questions, you should have have pre-crafted answers. If you're at a loss for stories, it may help to sit down and just brainstorm every relevant story you can remember (for example, every bug you remember working on), and then narrow it down from a larger list.

It's hard to practice this effectively in a vacuum, so this is a good thing to work with someone else on.

Once you've answered all your interviewer's soft questions, they may ask you if you have questions for them. Tell them you'll save your questions until the end of the interview. This will give you more time to for the actual programming part, which is the majority of where you'll be evaluated.

Now let's look at advice for the actual programming interview. This is going to be very whiteboarding-specific, but much of the advice applies to coding on a machine as well.

### How to Approach an Interview Problem

Before you answer any (non-trivial) question, always, always, always repeat back the question in your own words. Make sure you understand exactly what they're asking.

Expect that 10% of the time, you will misunderstand what they're actually asking. If that's the case, when you repeat back the question, they'll clarify. But if you misunderstand and jump straight to working on the wrong problem, they won't correct you for a while.

This is because if you start doing things that make no sense, your interviewer is usually just going to assume that you're incompetent.

This is okay. Your interviewer has a hard job, because most people are incompetent, and it's their job to interview incompetent people.

Thus, if they see you initially do something stupid, they will not charitably assume that you're a smart person who is just having a bad day. That's fine; you'll gradually gain credibility over the course of the interview. But it's important to be mindful of this initial dynamic.

Thus, you should be as explicit as possible in all of your communication. Spell things out in nauseating detail. This will both eliminate any potential miscommunication between you and your interviewer, and will also quickly convince them that you are not incompetent. This is surprisingly important.

Okay, let's move on.

For any non-trivial question, I almost always start by working through a small-medium sized example on the whiteboard. This again confirms that I understand the problem and develops my intuition for how to solve it. It's also worth throwing in some edge cases here to give yourself a sense for why the problem is tricky.

Don't ever jump straight to coding. Even if you think you know the answer, don't jump straight to coding. First, explain your approach in the abstract. If there are problems with your approach, your interviewer will often point them out here; by jumping straight in, your interviewer is more likely to let you hang yourself.

Once you begin mentally working through the problem, try to keep talking. Don't stop moving your mouth. Do your best to let the interviewer know everything that you're thinking at all times. No matter how small or stupid or uncertain the step you're taking in your head, just say it out loud. If you need time to think, say &ldquo;give me a moment to think about this.&rdquo; Then recount the results of your thinking, even if it was unfruitful.

Engineering interviews are as much about communication and thought process as they are about results. You can absolutely pass an interview on communication alone, even if you don't get the optimal answer.

Look at your interviewer. Engage with them. Ask them questions. Make a joke. Don't ask for help, ever. And don't give up.

Don't ever, ever give up. As long as they don't give up on you, you don't give up on yourself. Keep pushing, trying different things, and if you can't think of anywhere productive to go, just explain why everything you can think of won't work.

You'll get way more help, way more leeway, and way more empathy from your interviewer if you follow this advice.

If an efficient solution doesn't immediately jump out at you, go ahead and describe the brute force solution to the problem. You'll almost always get credit for something if you at least enumerate a correct but inefficient solution. You don't have to necessarily code it (depends if they ask you to). It's usually enough to just describe how it works. Then say, &ldquo;So that solves the problem in exponential time. But it's definitely not optimal. Let me see if I can find a more efficient approach.&rdquo; This will also help you grapple with the problem, and may give you a flash of insight on how to solve it efficiently.

A good heuristic for finding a brute-force solution is asking yourself: what's the algorithm that my brain uses to try to solve this problem if I wanted to solve it by hand?

Don't be afraid of looking stupid. It's okay to be wrong. It's okay to ask questions if you don't know what something means. Take it in stride and laugh about it. At almost all of the interviews where I received an offer, I botched at least one question. Don't let it ruffle you.

That said, if you think you know what something means but you're not 100% sure, trust your intuition. You'll usually be right. If you're not, it's okay to be corrected.

### Correcting your Interviewer

Sometimes you might think your interviewer is wrong about something.

Your interviewer will definitely be sometimes wrong. But it's much, much, much more likely that you'll be the one who's wrong. Think about it: you're stressed out of your mind and coding for dear life, while your interviewer is sitting in a chair and watching the hundredth person this year struggle to solve their favorite pet problem.

As a default, always defer to your interviewer and assume that you are mistaken. Never get defensive. Figure out why you're wrong. If you are in fact right, you should be able to prove it methodically.

Okay, so you've talked everything to death, now you're ready to write code. First, say: &ldquo;Would you like me to code this up?&rdquo;

If your interviewer has any final misgivings about your approach, this gives them an opportunity to stop you. They may also sometimes stop you if your algorithm is acceptable but they want you to find a more optimal approach.

But usually they'll say yes. So let's start writing code.

### Writing Code

Just kidding. You're not ready to code yet.

Before you write anything, first verbally verify your assumptions about the input. May I assume I never get negative inputs? May I assume these are all 64-bit integers? May I assume everything in this input string is ASCII-encoded? May I assume that my input is a hash map, formatted like so? Should I raise an error for an invalid input? How should this function behave if the input is a float?

Some of the time, your interviewer will be satisfied with this attention to detail and will allow you to hand-wave some error handling for invalid inputs. But if you don't mention it at all, they might later ask you &ldquo;ah, but what if you get a negative integer?&rdquo; Then you'll have to erase something and squeeze in a line for error handling and waste more time.

You're almost ready to code now. Announce the language you're going to write this in. You should strongly prefer a dynamically typed language with a rich standard library like Ruby or Python. Choosing a language like Java or C++ will only handicap you in how long it takes to express the same algorithm. You will not be graded on how hardcore of a programmer you are, only on whether you solved the problem in the allotted time.

Now is also the time to mention if there are any special data structures or libraries you need. It's totally cool to say &ldquo;May I assume that I have a prefix tree?&rdquo; even if you don't know of a prefix tree library in your language. It's okay to just declare the API as you go: &ldquo;I'm going to assume this heap has a .pop_min method.&rdquo;

And now it's time to code.

Always start at the top left corner of the board. Board management is surprisingly important in whiteboarding interviews. Erase stuff that's in your way and give yourself as much room as possible for the code.

More board management advice: don't close blocks (whether curly braces or *if* blocks) until you actually get to them. Closing them early will make things messy if you have to then squeeze in unexpected lines of code or do a lot of erasing.

As a general habit, add plenty of white space around lines. It's very, very common to have to add extra lines somewhere in a function. The more breathing room you leave, the easier that will be.

If you don't remember the exact name of a method, your interviewer won't care most of the time. Don't stress about it. Just come up with a reasonably close-enough name for it. If they ask what it does, just say: &ldquo;I could be mistaken about the name here, but this method creates an inverted version of a hash map so the unique values now point to their keys.&rdquo; Most interviewers will be satisfied with that.

Name your variables descriptively, but keep them short. It's going to suck to write long variable names repeatedly without autocomplete.

As you're writing, abstract away as much logic as you can into helper functions. This is a tremendously useful whiteboarding optimization.

Just invoke the helper functions as you go and don't feel the need to write their declarations immediately. Just say: &ldquo;I'll write this function afterward, but this just returns a hash table mapping each character in the string to its frequency.&rdquo;

Go ahead and keep working through your main function, and worry about the helpers later. This will keep you in your flow and will make it easier to read and reason about your code.

After you finish and establish the characteristics of your primary function's logic, oftentimes your interviewer will trust that you can write some of the helpers and won't want to watch you code them.

Just say: &ldquo;so this helper function does [blah blah blah]. Do you want me to write this as well?&rdquo; If they say yes, go ahead and write all your helper functions out. But this at least gives them the chance to say no. This optimization alone ended up saving me a lot of time across my interviews.

Finally, once you've finished all of the code, review everything. Just say &ldquo;okay, let me review this now.&rdquo; Read your code from top to bottom and ensure it makes sense. Follow it as though you had a debugger, actually tracing the path and transformations of an input. Fix any obvious mistakes. Then start inspecting for edge cases.

Most common edge cases: the input is null/empty, the input is 0 or size 0, the input is 1 or size 1, or the input contains duplicates. Try to suss out the assumptions you're making and see how they could be violated.

Once you're satisfied that your solution accounts for edge cases, then and only then turn to your interviewer and announce &ldquo;I believe this solves the problem.&rdquo; Make it clear that you believe you're done.

Now go ahead and analyze the algorithm. Announce the time complexity and space complexity of your solution. Talk about any tradeoffs you might be able to make. &ldquo;If you wanted to take O(n^3) time, then you could just memoize all the answers and return them in O(1) time for subsequent queries. But that comes at a big up-front time and space cost.&rdquo;

### Assorted Heuristics

This is kind of dumb, but I thought I'd include this because people seem to find it helpful.

If you're blanking during an interview, try these rules of thumb, roughly in order of usefulness:

1. Try hash maps.
2. If your problem fundamentally breaks down to searching for something, consider binary search.
3. Try sorting your input.
4. Can you break the problem down into sub-problems? Does solving the problem for size (N – 1) make solving it for size N any easier? If so, try to solve recursively and/or with dynamic programming.
5. If you have a lot of strings, try putting them in a prefix tree.
6. Any time you repeatedly have to take the min or max of a dynamic collection, think heaps. (If you don't need to insert random elements, prefer a sorted array.)

Okay, so the interview is finally over. Now it's time to ask your interviewer questions. This part, too, is surprisingly important.

### Grill Your Interviewers

A common trope people throw around is &ldquo;you're interviewing them as much as they're interviewing you.&rdquo; I say if that's true, then put them through the goddamn wringer.

Ask them why they decided to join the company. Ask them what they think the company could improve at. Ask them about a time that they messed up and how it was handled. Ask them how they see themselves growing at this company in the next few years. Ask them what they wish someone would have told them before they joined. Ask them if they ever think about leaving, and if they were to leave, where they would go.

To be clear, these are not necessarily questions about the company. They are questions *about your interviewer*.

I advocate grilling your interviewer for a few reasons:

* Your interviewer is likely representative of the people you'll be working with if you join. You should learn as much as possible about the kind of people who work here.
* It's going to give you a lot more insight into the company than any generic question will.
* It gives you some momentum in the interview. Instead of constantly being on the defensive, by asking tough questions, you get some time to breathe while your interviewer reacts to your questions.
* It's also just more interesting!

That said, you will probably have some burning questions you actually want to ask your specific interviewer, like &ldquo;How did you get into data engineering?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What are your feelings on the company's transition toward service-oriented architecture?&rdquo;

That leads me to my second piece of advice when it comes to grilling interviewers.

Most of the time you won't have snappy, specific questions to ask. So memorize a set of questions and ask them again and again. Not just for different companies&mdash;literally ask successive interviewers at the same company the exact same thing.

Why?

Because for one, interviewers usually solicit questions at the end of an interview. By then there's a good chance you'll be psychologically drained and won't feel like coming up with novel, incisive questions.

(Never, ever, ever say &ldquo;I have no questions.&rdquo; Be interested!)

Second, interviewers don't compare notes on which questions a candidate asked them. So if you have a good set of questions, nobody at the company will know you asked the same questions.

Third, even if they did, they wouldn't care. Good questions are still good questions, and it's worthwhile to hear different people's answers to the same good question. I've learned a lot about different companies' dynamics this way.

### Be Excited

This is the final point I want to make, and it applies to your entire interview process.

Be excited about the company. It's trite, but it makes a huge difference. Be excited to interview. Be excited to learn about what your interviewer does and the prospect of getting to work with them. Tell them how much you like the people you met and that you dig the culture.

Interviewing is surprisingly like dating. Your interviewer is disproportionately more likely to be excited about you if you're excited about them. That positivity will make them more want to work with you, and even go to bat for you when it comes decision time.

Not only that, but excitement is a signal that you actually want to do the job they're hiring you for, and that you're going to work your ass off to do it well. If your interview performance was anywhere near the edge, your excitement may end up pushing you over the finish line.

You'll likely be interviewing at different companies, but you should always talk about what makes this company unique and captivating. If you're not sure, just ask your interviewers&mdash;what makes them love working here? You can then reflect back that answer.

At the same time, you don't want to appear desperate. I liked using the phrase &ldquo;looking for good mutual fit.&rdquo; You want to be discriminating, but you also want to seem winnable if they make you the right offer. If you seem outright disinterested in the company, then they probably won't want to make you an offer even if you pass their technical bar.

Companies do vary significantly in culture. But a lot of &ldquo;culture fit&rdquo; really just comes down to a simple question: would your interviewers actually want to be your colleague?

It's much easier for them to say yes if you sound excited. So make it easy for them.

title: The Myth of the Feel Player
tags: [poker]

There is a vague and shadowy mythology surrounding the Feel Player. He is a genius of mysterious origins. No one can explain how or why he is good at poker&mdash;not even the Feel Player himself. He is like a mathematical prodigy hailing from a tiny, illiterate village in India, or a low-born squire who pulls a mythical sword from its pedestal. He is a fluke, an exception. He is not supposed to be great, yet somehow he is.

Perhaps it is his impossibility that so excites us. Or perhaps it is the dream that he offers&mdash;that we, too, could be great like him. By telling ourselves the story of the Feel Player, we drop our business cards into an imaginary lottery. What, in the end, could be more democratic, more reassuring, more feel-good than the possibility of the Feel Player?

I am here to assure you, gentle reader, that the notion of a Feel Player is a myth.

In this article, we will examine the concept of a Feel Player, what it can tell us about cognition and unconscious competence, how Feel Players evolve (or don't), and why the concept of the Feel Player can be so detrimental to students of poker.

First, let's try to begin, unlike the Feel Player, unsensationally&mdash;what, properly defined, is this mysterious player?

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VfCSx5641U4">[video]</div>

## What is a Feel Player?

The hallmark of the Feel Player is in the way he justifies his plays. When you ask a Feel Player why he made a bluff, he'll answer, &ldquo;it felt right.&rdquo; When you ask him why he folded the second-nuts, he'll say, &ldquo;I felt like he had it.&rdquo; The origins of his answers are a mystery. Where the rest of us invoke combinatorials, betting logics and notes we've taken, the Feel Player invokes the god in his head.

But somehow&mdash;awesomely&mdash;the god in his head is usually right.

There are many poker players who have, for me, embodied the myth of the Feel Player. Personally, I have always seen Ilari Sahamies (Ziigmund) as the foremost exemplar of this phenomenon. Of course, there are many others. And while I have seen many Feel Players come and go, few have lasted the test of time.

There is a common belief is that Feel Players have a different and unique style of thinking. I.e., some players are analytical and theory-heavy, whereas others are intuitive and feel-heavy. &ldquo;Feel&rdquo; is seen as merely a thinking style, like the difference between auditory and visual learning.

&ldquo;Feel&rdquo;, then, is shorthand for intuition&mdash;pure unconscious competence. We've talked about this concept before in previous chapters, but let's look at it in a little more detail.

## Feel and Consciousness

As previously stated, there are four phases of learning in the process of mastering any skill:

1. unconscious incompetence (inattentively being bad)
2. conscious incompetence (attentively being bad)
3. conscious competence (attentively being good)
4. unconscious competence (inattentively being good)

In a simple task, you can progress uniformly from one stage to the next. But poker is an extremely complex game. Instead of thinking of poker as a single skill to be optimized from stages one to four, we should think of ability in poker as comprising *many* different skills&mdash;innumerably many&mdash;each of which is at a different stage in these phases of learning. Because poker is so intricate and incorporates so many different situations and types of reasoning, even the best players in the world will have some parts of their game that have not passed on to the stage of unconscious competence.

Consider **&ldquo;autopilot&rdquo;**. In poker, what we call autopilot is another way of referring to the entirety of your unconscious competence&mdash;your poker &ldquo;muscle memory,&rdquo; so to speak. When you are autopiloting, you are essentially restricted to only your poker skills that are unconsciously mastered&mdash;skills in the fourth stage of mastery. Everything that is not mastered to that level (that is, skills in which you are only consciously competent) will be suddenly missing from your game. So if, when you autopilot, your flop checkraising game vanishes, this tells you that your flop checkraising game is still not yet mastered to the level of unconscious competence. Although autopiloting is often seen as a bad thing, it is invaluable for elucidating which parts of your game are completely automatic&mdash;and, by implication, which parts are not. So when we are *not* autopiloting&mdash;when we are playing our **A-game**&mdash;there is a thread of conscious chatter that's running through our heads. This conscious thread is what gives us access to all of our consciously competent poker skills. The goal, then, is *not* to remove all of the chatter from your mind. This is somewhat unlike other activities, such as juggling or dancing, in which the goal is to &ldquo;get out of your head&rdquo; and &ldquo;just be in the moment.&rdquo; The chatter we experience when playing good poker is essential for invoking the skills in which we have only conscious competence.

The neurological difference between conscious and unconscious processes is not well understood, but experiments have demonstrated that the difference is real and crucial to managing performance. Consider, for example, driving your car to work in the morning, compared to driving your car on the motorway in a thunderstorm. On a normal day you drive very inattentively, perhaps listening to music, or talking to a passenger. But during a thunderstorm you probably turn the music down, lean forward in your seat, and are fully focused on the task. By fully attending to your driving, you recruit all of the subtlety and attention you can to your handling of the car. Things like fine handling, reactionary decision-making, and adjusting your speed to weather and visibility conditions are skills that most drivers *don't* have unconsciously mastered. We intuitively recognize this, and adjust our concentration levels according to the needs (and dangers) of the task at hand.

But perhaps you might argue that poker is a very mental game&mdash;it's not a physical activity like playing tennis or driving a car. How is it that such a mental game can be automated into our mental muscle memory, such that we don't even have to think about it? One process that explains this is chunking**.** Chunking is the process by which larger and larger patterns of information are condensed or &ldquo;chunked&rdquo; into single mental units. A good example of this is in the assessment of starting hands. The first time you ever played no-limit Hold'em, perhaps you looked at a hand like A7o, and processed it as &ldquo;I have an ace and a seven.&rdquo; Perhaps you considered how each of those cards could facilitate hitting a pair&mdash;a pair of 7s, or a pair of aces, and maybe you figured this to be pretty good. But now, as an experienced poker player who's been dealt thousands of A7's, you treat A7o as not two separate cards, but one distinct &ldquo;chunk&rdquo; of a hand. You think very fluidly and quickly about how A7o does against other chunked hole cards&mdash;A5, AJ, 78, etc.

The more we play poker, the more we are able to chunk bigger and more complex patterns of information into single units. As you continue to gain experience, you will start to chunk flops&mdash;such that Js8s7c will become a flop that you will play so many times, you will no longer analyze it card-by-card, but will see it as one discrete thing. And when the turn comes down 2d, a blank, you will not have to analyze that card separately either, because you know exactly how you're supposed to play with your JTo on Js8s7c+low blank. Once something is chunked, it no longer needs to be consciously analyzed, and hand processing speed increases exponentially. You're not thinking anymore &ldquo;what do I beat and what don't I beat on this board? How many hand combos are ahead of me?&rdquo; but instead, you just unconsciously &ldquo;sense&rdquo; the relative strength of your hand on this board, and play it accordingly. Once a skill becomes unconsciously competent, it is almost always chunked to a high degree. And because chunking requires a great depth of experience, the only way to reach this level of unconscious competence is by putting in thousands of hours and consciously analyzing them so many times that the analysis becomes crystallized in your chunking. Thus, that spot can eventually be dealt with as a single unconscious unit.

So when I ask you, &ldquo;why do you think A83r is a bad board to checkraise?&rdquo; you might not have an immediate answer&mdash;perhaps, for you, you just know this intuitively. It's part of your chunked sense of A83r; you &ldquo;feel&rdquo; it. But if you take a minute to think about it, you can probably retrospectively explain&mdash;&ldquo;well, if I checkraise that board I'm repping very few hands, most Axs I have will just check/call, and he has more big aces if he's raised preflop,&rdquo; and so on.

We all have some of our decisions relegated to &ldquo;feel,&rdquo; but most of us can still reproduce the theory needed to derive them again if needed. Yet according to the popular mythology, the Feel Player cannot do this.

## The Evolution of the Feel Player

So how could such a thing as a Feel Player ever arise? How could someone who doesn't theoretically analyze their hands ever become good at poker?

It's not as unlikely as you might think.

First, let us remember that poker is a **stochastic** game&mdash;that is to say, it's non-deterministic. Poker is stochastic in that it gives *partially random* feedback to your plays. E.g., if you make a *good* checkraise, your feedback might still be negative (the checkraise fails and you get punished) 30% of the time. Not only that, but there's second-level stochasticity&mdash;the checkraise might be good against 80% of players who've given off the same reads your opponent has, and bad against 20%, so even if you've made a bad checkraise against *this* player, one of the 20%, it might be good on average. Add stuff like getting sucked out and coolers, and you can see how poker gives chaotic and unreliable feedback.

But the idea we have is that the Feel Player is *purely responding**to feedback*. He is simply listening to what poker is telling him&mdash;little *yes*'s and *no*'s&mdash;and like someone learning to balance on one foot, he gradually gets better and better, with his body continually nudging him in the right direction. Perhaps this seems a little farfetched to you. Isn't poker too messy for a player like that to ever get good?

Let me provide you with a hypothetical Monte Carlo simulation. Imagine a group of 1,000,000 &ldquo;theory&rdquo; players, and one of 1,000,000 Feel Players. The theory players are, obviously, those who use poker theory to negotiate the game, whereas the Feel Players are learning purely from poker's stochastic feedback. Of course, a lot of those theory players are going to fail; maybe they're not smart enough, or they're too tilty, or just unlucky&mdash;but let's say that only 30% of them succeed as poker players. That gives us 300,000 surviving theory players. For Feel Players, on the other hand, *tons* of them are going to fail&mdash;poker is so random and their learning is so undirected, the vast majority of them will drop off like flies. But given the sheer numbers and the fact that poker might, in its random feedback, nudge some of those players into really good habits, let's say that 0.5% of them succeed. That gives us 5,000 successful Feel Players.

That's a ratio of 1:60 for Feel Players to theory players. That's a pretty lopsided ratio. But it's enough for most people to have run into many of them, and for a couple Feel Players to be prominent among the top 300 players in the world. But the &ldquo;Feel Player&rdquo; seems like a prominent phenomenon; surely there are more than 1:60, you might say.

In fact, Feel Players are overwhelmingly rare at the highest levels&mdash;we just tend to notice them a lot more. It's a sort of availability bias; they're mentally overrepresented. Theory players are everywhere. They're boring and mechanical. But Feel Players are sensational, rare, and fascinating, so we pay more attention to them. We hang on their every word, we watch them in games, and we root for them. Why? Perhaps because they are like us. Feel Players take crazy risks. They tilt. They make plays no one would ordinarily make. Just the idea of being a Feel Player, of thumbing your nose at the meticulous and boring process of poker theorizing&mdash;this is an exciting attitude in and of itself. The Feel Player appears to show us that anyone can win at poker. It doesn't take a genius, or having spent thousands of hours studying the game, or the ability to do GTO simulations or combinatorial calculations. So we follow him. We tell his story. We, in a sense, create the myth of the Feel Player.

## The Luck of the Draw

Now think, how many Feel Players do you really know of? Make a mental list. And of those, how many *are you really sure* are Feel Players, and not just players whose poker theory you don't really know much about? I'd be surprised if you knew of more than five who are still successful.

A Monte Carlo simulation can account for the existence of Feel Players. But this doesn't mean that one should take them seriously. As with any tall tale, the point isn't whether or not it actually happened. The fact is, being a Feel Player is not a reliable way to become good at poker. It's not a learning style, or a way of being. We are better off thinking of Feel Players, rather than as geniuses or heroes, as simply really, really lucky.

It's strange, I know, to call someone who is highly skilled &ldquo;lucky.&rdquo; We reserve that word generally for people who are ostensibly bad. But in fact, if you are looking at the top 0.1% of Feel Players&mdash;the ones who are successful&mdash;their getting conditioned by poker in the exact right way to produce good habits was purely a matter of luck. It was out of their hands. Even though they may now be good, solid, consistent cash game players, they still may have been just as lucky as a first-time fish who binks a bracelet, depending on the EV and unlikelihood of those events. Feel Players have no control over their development. They don't &ldquo;choose&rdquo; to get good. They may *happen* to become good, but if you took 100 simulations of their life, with all of the decisions that they made held constant, they would succeed in only one, whereas a theory player might succeed in 20 of them.

And that is also why Feel Players as a race are going extinct. You don't hear as much about them now as you used to. This is because Feel Players in general have very short lifespans. After all, if your conditioning and learning was mostly random, what makes you think it's going to continue to keep up with evolving games? In that sense, Feel Players are much like comets. They may burn brightly for a time, and that draws our eye to them, but they go out just as fast and foolishly as they arrived. This is not to mention that the chance of a Feel Player reaching the highest levels is becoming more and more unlikely, as poker continues to get harder and more players are employing complex strategies guided by game theory and exploitation. Strategies that you could've stumbled into three years ago and taken a run at high stakes with are now not enough to break even in $2/$4 games.

Poker is changing. The fact that you're reading this article probably means that you're on the right side of that change. It was merely 10 years ago that basic poker conversations we have nowadays would've been scoffed at as reductionistic, nonsensical, or &ldquo;not what the game is about.&rdquo;

Don't get me wrong. I'm not suggesting that intuition is not important, or that &ldquo;feel&rdquo; doesn't play a role in most of our decisions. It absolutely does. There are many things that our unconscious minds are better at processing than our conscious minds will ever be. Theory can only do so much; it is slow, lumbering, and we often have no time to work through the full calculations in a hand before we must make a decision. Further, there are games like PLO, which can become so complex that it's impossible to do EV simulations in many flop scenarios. We are always navigating poker unconsciously, and often &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; out the terrain with our guts before our brains. But we must also remember that, as poker players, we are tasked with the responsibility of doing *everything we possibly can* to become good. Poker, rake, and randomness are all working against us. Nothing is in our favor. So we must enlist every tool at our disposal&mdash;theory being perhaps the strongest. All theory players use feel; without it, they would be uselessly slow. But properly oriented, theory is like the charioteer, directing the raw and wild power of feel.

One of the greatest benefits of theory, after all, is its ability to reduce the stochasticity of poker feedback. Without theory, you might be conditioned not to make that checkraise again&mdash;but with a solid understanding of theory, you may realize that even though this hand gave you a *no*, solid theory will reassure you that it was really a wider *yes* in the long run. Thus, you don't swallow the randomness and noise that poker is feeding you, and instead you shape your game closer to the real mechanics of poker. Feel is like a wild horse, dragging you every which way, and it is up to theory to tame it and keep yourself on course. Thus without theory, your learning is at the mercy of far more chaos (not to mention cognitive biases).

In reality, there are probably no true Feel Players at high stakes anymore. The binary I initially presented is a bit of a fantasy&mdash;rather than theory versus feel, it's really &ldquo;theory and feel,&rdquo; in constant orbit of one another. In reality, every serious, modern-day poker player has *some* idea of theory that's guiding his play. Some, like Ilari perhaps, just have relatively less compared to their peers. Inevitably, these things are hard to quantify, and in truth, a lot of it is probably just perception. Perhaps Ilari is a theory player, and just doesn't seem that way&mdash;or hides it. I would never know. But whoever is or isn't a feel player is beside the point. The point is. feel is not a learning style. Feel is ubiquitous, and necessary for every poker player, and always has been. But it's a cop-out. It's the luck of the draw. It is not a reliable way to become good.

So you know the [first 6 rules](https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/). You've maneuvered through the initial offer conversation, you've lined up counteroffers from other companies, and now it's time to move into the actual negotiating.

Naturally, this is the part where everything goes horribly wrong.

But worry not. Stick with me, and I'm going to make you into a superhuman negotiator. (Or at least an eccentric billionaire negotiator, which is sometimes better?)

Seriously though. In this article I'm going to deep dive on the whole negotiating process, and discuss the final 4 rules on how to negotiate a job offer.

Right. Let's start from the top.

What does it take to be a good negotiator?

Most people think negotiating well is just looking the other person in the eye, appearing confident, and asking for tons of money. But being a good negotiator is a lot more subtle than that.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7hYKw-hL6OM/">[video]</div>

## What Good Negotiators Sound Like

You probably have a friend or family member who's infamous for refusing to take no for an answer. The kind of person who will march into a department store and bullheadedly argue with the management until they get a purchase refunded.

This person seems like they often get what they want. They make you cringe, but perhaps you should try to be more like them.

Rest assured, this person is actually a terrible negotiator. They're good at being difficult and causing a scene, which can sometimes convince a waitress or shift manager to appease them. But this style of negotiating will get you nowhere when negotiating with a business partner (that is, an employer).

A good negotiator is empathetic and collaborative. They don't try to control you or issue ultimatums. Rather, they try to think creatively about how to fulfill both your and their needs.

So when you think of negotiating a job offer, don't imagine haggling over a used car. Think more like negotiating dinner plans with a group of friends, and you'll fare much better.

## Slicing up the cake

Another important difference between good and bad negotiators is that bad negotiators tend to think of a negotiation as a zero-sum game.

Imagine we're negotiating over a cake. In a zero-sum negotiation if I get one more slice, you get one less. Any gain I make comes at your expense.

This seems obviously true with cake, right? So what makes a job negotiation any different?

Ah, but it's not actually true for cake. What if I hate corner pieces and you love them? What if I really like the cherries? What if I prefer to scrape off some of the frosting, but you love extra frosting? What if I'm full and you're starving, but you'll agree to treat me to my favorite cake next time?

Of course, when I posed the question I didn't mention anything about cherries or my feelings on corner pieces. It might seem like I just made shit up.

But this is exactly what good negotiators do. They bend the rules. They question assumptions and ask unexpected questions. They dig to find the core what everyone values and looks for creative ways to widen the terrain of negotiation.

While you were thinking about how to haggle over slices, I'm thinking about how to give both of us more than just half of a cake.

Different parties in a negotiation almost always have different value functions. We may value the *same* things&mdash;we both care about cake, after all. But we we don't value them in exactly the same way, so there's probably a way to give each of us more of what we want.

Most people go into a job negotiation thinking they need to stubbornly haggle over salary like slices of cake. They don't ever stop to ask&mdash;hey, what do I actually value? Why do I value it? What does the company value? Why do they value that?

There are many dimensions in a job negotiation: salary, signing bonus, stock, a year-end or performance bonus, commuter benefits, relocation expenses, equipment, an educational stipend, a childcare stipend, extra vacation time, a later start date, getting a dedicated hour a day to work out or study or meditate or play solitaire. You could choose which team you're assigned to, what your first project will be, what technologies you'll be working with, and sometimes even choose your title.

Maybe you're a frosting person, and the company is more into cherries. You never know if you don't ask.

Hold onto this mindset.

Okay.

Let's pick up the negotiation where we left off. All the offers are in, and recruiters are eagerly awaiting for you to get the ball rolling.

Let's start negotiating.

## Phone vs Email

Your first decision is whether you're going to negotiate over the phone or keep it over e-mail.

Talking on the phone not only signals confidence, but more importantly, it allows you to build a strong relationship with your recruiter.

Talking on the phone enables bantering, telling jokes, and building connection. You want your recruiter to like you, understand you, empathize with you, and want you to succeed. Likewise, you want to care about your recruiter and understand what's motivating them.

The best deals get made between friends. It's hard to make friends over e-mail.

However, if you don't have confidence in your negotiation skills, you should try to push the negotiation to e-mail. Written, asynchronous communication will give you more time to strategize and make it easier to say uncomfortable things without being pressured by a recruiter.

That said, recruiters will always prefer to get you on the phone. It's essentially their home turf. They're also well aware that negotiating is easier over e-mail, and they have little interest in making it easier on you. They'll often be vague about the offer over e-mail and only offer to discuss specific details on the phone.

If you want to stick to email, you have to push back against this. There's no secret to it: just be honest and ask for what you want.

Tell them:

> Hi recruiter, I hope your day is treating you well!
>
> Re: your previous e-mail, I'd prefer to discuss the details of the offer over e-mail. I sometimes get nervous during important phone calls, so discussing the offer over e-mail helps me to keep a clear head and communicate more clearly. I hope this is okay with you. :)

No bullshit, no huff-puffery. Just telling the truth and asking for what you want.

There's tremendous power in honesty and directness. Take advantage of it.

(Also, note how I wrote &ldquo;discuss the details of the offer&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;negotiate.&rdquo; Never describe what you're doing as negotiating&mdash;that sounds immediately adversarial and haggley. Describe it instead as a discussion, and they're less likely to recoil.)

## Having Alternatives

I mentioned before how essential it is to have multiple offers. I'll reiterate again&mdash;it's very, very valuable to have multiple offers.

With other offers on the table, if your negotiation doesn't work out, they know you'll just accept another offer. Your negotiating position suddenly becomes a lot more credible because they know you're willing to walk away.

This effect is strengthened if you get an offer from a prestigious company. And the effect goes through the roof if you have an offer from a company's primary competitor (now they'll really want to poach you from the big bad competitor-corp).

Some of this behavior is stupid tribalism. And some part of it is rational in trying to deprive competitors of talent. Either way, take advantage of it, and be tactical in which companies you aim for.

But what if you don't manage to get any other offers? Does all the negotiating just go out the window?

Not at all. What's important here is not actually having other offers. More specifically, it's in having strong alternatives. Which is why **Rule #6 of negotiating is: have alternatives.**

A negotiation needs stakes. If there were no risk and you knew for sure the other side would sign a contract, what incentive would you have to offer them anything more?

Your alternatives are what give a negotiation its stakes. By signaling your alternatives, you allow your interlocutor to develop a mental model of when and why you'll walk away from the negotiation. Your alternatives also have an anchoring effect on how much the other side thinks you're objectively worth.

In negotiation literature, your best alternative is often referred to as your BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement). Basically, it's what you'd do if you walked away.

I like the term BATNA a lot, mostly because it sounds like a gadget Batman would lob at bad guys.

So what's your BATNA if you don't have other offers? Do you even have one?

Of course you do. Your best alternative might be &ldquo;interview at more companies&rdquo; or &ldquo;go to grad school&rdquo; or &ldquo;stay at your current job&rdquo; or &ldquo;go on sabbatical in Morocco for a few months&rdquo; (as it was for a friend of mine who was deliberating between joining a startup and gallivanting through North Africa).

The point is, you don't need to have another offer to have a strong BATNA. *Your BATNA's strength comes from 1) how strong the other side perceives it to be, and 2) how strong you perceive it to be.*

If your recruiter thinks that going to grad school is an awesome thing to do, then they'll see you as having a very strong alternative, and the stakes of the negotiation will be raised.

But even if they think grad school is ridiculous, if you convince them that you'd be totally happy to go to grad school, then the burden is on them to make this deal more attractive to you than going to grad school.

Thus, *you need to communicate your BATNA*. This doesn't need to be ham-fisted, but you need to make it a background to the negotiation. (Note: usually whenever you signal your BATNA, you should also re-emphasize your interest in reaching an agreement).

Examples:

> I've received another offer from [OTHER CORP] that's very compelling on salary, but I really love the mission of [YOUR COMPANY] and think that it would overall be a better fit for me.
>
> I'm also considering going back to grad school and getting a Master's degree in Postmodern Haberdashery. I'm excited about [YOUR COMPANY] though and would love to join the team, but the package has to make sense if I'm going to forego a life of ironic hatmaking.

Note: one of the biggest mistakes I see here is from people who are currently working. If you already have a job, staying where you are is often your BATNA.

This means if you tell your interlocutor that you hate your job, then they know your BATNA sucks, and have no incentive to negotiate with you (on top of potentially thinking that you're a negative person). Always emphasize the pros of your current company, your seniority, your impact, and whatever else you like about where you currently work.

*You should make your decision seem genuinely close for it to be a strong BATNA.*

## What a Job Negotiation Means to an Employer

I've kept saying that to be an effective negotiator you need to understand the other side. So let's take a look at what it's like to negotiate as an employer. (I'm going to have to use the tech industry in my examples here; the details will differ by industry.)

First, we have to rewind and understand what brought us to this offer in the first place. What kind of resources have they spent so far in trying to fill this position?

* Writing and posting a job description on all appropriate channels ($300)
* Reviewing ~100 or more resumes ($1250)
* About 15% of those resumes need to be phone screened, so roughly 15 phone screens ($2250)
* Around 75% of those initial phone screens warrant a technical screen, so roughly 11 technical screens ($9000)
* About 30% pass through to an on-site, so roughly 3 onsites. These onsites require the coordination of 6-7 employees ($10800)
* Finally, they make one offer. The recruiter (and potentially the executive staff) need to spend time on the phone with the offeree convincing and negotiating. ($900)

<p class="note">Numbers nabbed from <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-average-cost-of-recruiting-an-engineer-in-Silicon-Valley/answer/Rick-Brownlow?srid=tvlO">here</a>.</p>

All-in-all this process took about 45 days from start to finish.

Now say you end up turning down their offer. They've spent over $24,000 just extending this single offer to you (to say nothing of opportunity costs), and now they'll essentially have to start over from scratch.

This is what a company faces if you turn them down.

Realize what a gauntlet they've been through!

Realize how important it is that you're the one!

Out of the droves and droves who've shown up on their doorstep, *you're* the one they want. They want to usher you into their tribe. They went through so much crap to get you here, and now they've found you.

And you're worried that if you negotiate, they'll take it away?

Further yet, understand that salary is only one part of the cost of employing you. An employer also has to pay for your benefits, your equipment, space, utilities, other random expenses, and employment taxes on top of all of that. All-in, [your actual salary often comprises less than 50% of the total cost of employing you](http://web.mit.edu/e-club/hadzima/pdf/how-much-does-an-employee-cost.pdf).

(Which means they expect that your value to the company, in terms of the revenue you'll generate, to be more than 2x your salary. If they didn't believe that, they wouldn't be hiring you at all.)

So, this is all to say: everything is stacked in your favor. It doesn't feel that way, but it absolutely is.

Realize that when you are agonizing over whether to ask for another few thousand dollars, what they're doing is praying with bated breath that you'll sign the offer.

If you don't sign the offer, they lose. Losing a good candidate sucks. No one wants to believe that their company isn't worth working for.

They want to win. They will pay to win.

And yet, you might worry: &ldquo;but if end up negotiating more, won't they have higher expectations? Won't my boss end up hating me for negotiating?&rdquo;

**No, and no.**

It's your role that will determine your performance expectations, not how much you negotiated. Making 5k more or less in salary doesn't matter at all. Your manager will literally just not care about this.

Remember how expensive it is to even employ you in the first place! Nobody's going to fire you because you're performing 5K worse than they expected you to; the cost of firing you and hiring someone else is a lot more than 5K to begin with.

And no, your boss won't hate you now. And in fact, at most big companies the person you're negotiating with won't even be your boss. Recruiting and management are totally separate departments, completely abstracted from one another. And even if you're at a startup, trust me that your boss is used to negotiating with candidates and doesn't put nearly as much significance in it as you do.

In short: negotiating is easier and more normal than you think, and companies are completely willing to negotiate with you. If your intuition tells you otherwise, trust that your mental model is wrong.

## How to Give the First Number

In [part 1](https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/), I mentioned how valuable it is not to have to give the first number. But there are times when you can't avoid it. In that case, there are ways to give the first number without giving the first number.

If a company asks you &ldquo;what are your salary expectations?&rdquo; you might say:

> I don't have any particular numbers in mind. I'm more interested in learning whether this will be a good mutual fit. If it is, I'm open to exploring any offer so long as it's competitive.

Sounds good. But they push back,

> I understand that, but we need to have a clear idea of what you think is competitive. I need to know whether it's worth going through the interview process. We're a young startup, so I need to make sure we're on the same page as far as compensation.

That's a strong push. But you can still push back.

> I completely hear you, and I agree it's important that we're on the same page. I really have no particular numbers in my head, it all depends on the fit and the composition of the offer. Once we decide we want to work together, I think that's the best time to figure out a compensation package that makes sense.

Most employers will relent here. But there's a small chance they push further:

> Okay, look, you're being difficult. Let's not waste each other's time. What's an offer that you'd be willing to take?

This is a decision point. They're trying to take away your negotiating power and pin you to a premature decision.

That said, you probably will have to say a number at this point, or risk damaging the trust in this relationship. (They *are* making a valid point that startups can't offer the same kind of cash as large companies, nor should you expect them to. They might be sensing that you're not aware of this.)

But you can give a number here without actually giving a number.

> Well, okay. I know that the average software engineer in Silicon Valley makes roughly 120K a year salary. So I think that's a good place to start.

Notice what I did here. I didn't actually answer the question &ldquo;what's an offer you'd be willing to take,&rdquo; I merely anchored the conversation around the fulcrum of &ldquo;the average software engineer salary.&rdquo;

So if you're forced to give a number, do so by appealing to an objective metric, such as an industry average (or your current salary). And make it clear that you're merely starting the negotiation there, not ending it.

## How to Ask for More

Say an offer is out there, and now you want to improve it. As always, be direct and ask for what you want. Here are generally the steps you should take.

First, reiterate your interest in the company. This is as simple as:

> I'm really excited about the problems you guys are working on at Evil Corp&hellip;

Now frame why you're asking for more. There are two choices here: you can say that you're on the fence and that an improvement might convince you, or you can go stronger and say that you're outright dissatisfied with the offer. Which approach you choose depends on how much leverage you have, how weak the offer is relative to your BATNA, and whether you have other offers (the weaker your negotiating position, generally the more tentative you should be).

Either way, be unfailingly polite.

If you're dissatisfied with the offer, you might say something like:

> I appreciate the work you guys put into constructing this offer. But there were a couple things I was unsatisfied with.

If you want to be more reserved, you can say something like:

> The offer you guys extended was strong. Right now my decision is basically between you and [XYZ CORP]. It's a genuinely difficult decision for me, but there are a couple of dimensions where, if this offer improved, it would be much more compelling.

Don't just say something like:

> Thanks for the offer. Here are some ways I think it could improve.

This makes you sound like an ass. Be polite, and if you want to strengthen the offer, tell them clearly how you feel about it. This builds trust and conveys seriousness.

Let's say you want to raise the salary. Now that you have a specific ask, it's time to employ **rule #7: proclaim reasons for everything.**

We all implicitly know the catch-22 of negotiation: if you say you want more salary, you'll sound greedy. And no one likes greedy people, right? So why would they want to give more money to a greedy person?

I suspect this is the primary reason why so many candidates recoil from negotiating. They don't want to *feel* greedy. It goes against all of their social conditioning. And yet, there are some situations in which most people would be totally fine negotiating.

Specifically, *when they have to.*

If you *had* to raise your salary or you wouldn't be able to afford rent, or if you had to negotiate health insurance to cover a medical condition, you'd negotiate without a twinge of regret. The difference? That you have a *reason* for what you're requesting.

It's kind of a brain-hack, both for yourself and for your negotiating partner. Just stating a reason&mdash;any reason&mdash;makes your request feel human and important. It's not you being greedy, it's you trying to fulfill your goals.

The more unobjectionable and sympathetic your reason, the better. If it's medical expenses, or paying off student loans, or taking care of family, you'll bring tears to their eyes. I told employers that I was earning-to-give, so since I was donating 33% of my income to charity, I had negotiate aggressively to leave myself enough to live off.

But honestly, even if your reason is inane and unimpressive, it will still carry this effect.

Just saying &ldquo;can you improve the salary?&rdquo; sounds like you're boringly motivated by money. But if you say &ldquo;I really want to buy a house within the next year; what can we do to improve the salary?&rdquo; this suddenly seems a lot more legitimate.

If they turn down your request now, they're implicitly telling you &ldquo;no Jennifer, you can't buy your house. I guess you don't deserve one.&rdquo; No one wants to do that. They want to be the one who says &ldquo;Alright Jennifer, I talked with the director and I made it happen. You're getting that new house!&rdquo;

Of course, it goes without saying that the reason you want money is so that you can spend it on things. What do they think you're going to use it for, toilet paper?

I know. It's stupid. It's really stupid, but it works.

Just go with it, state a reason for everything, and you'll find recruiters more willing to become your advocate.

## Assert your Value

One effective move you can make in a negotiation, especially after an ask, is to emphasize the unique value you'll be bringing to the company. Example:

> Blah blah blah, I want X, Y, and Z.
>
> I know that you guys are looking for someone to build out your Android team. I believe I bring a lot of experience leading a team of Android developers and I'm confident that I'll be able to bring your mobile offerings up to parity with your competitors.
>
> Let me know your thoughts.

Be confident without boasting or trying to hold yourself specific metrics (unless you're supremely confident). Whatever you assert should be something you've touched on earlier in your discussions, but it's okay to repeat it now as a gentle reminder. It reminds them of the carrot and shows that you're still excited to add value.

This is not appropriate in every negotiation, especially for very junior positions, where it's harder to differentiate yourself. But later in your career (or for more specialized/consulting roles) this can be a really valuable nudge.

## What to Ask For

This brings me to **rule #8: be motivated by more than just money.** Note, this is not code for &ldquo;if you seem like you're motivated by more than just money, you'll get more money.&rdquo;

There is no bigger turn-off to a company than somebody who only cares about money. This is something you're not going to be able to fake.

*Actually be motivated by other things.* You should be motivated by money too of course, but it should be one among many dimensions you're optimizing for. How much training you get, what your first project will be, which team you join, or even who your mentor will be&mdash;these are all things you can and should negotiate.

Among these factors, salary is perhaps the least important.

What do you really value? Be creative. Don't try to haggle over slices of cake when there's so much more on the table.

Of course, to negotiate well you need to understand the other side's preferences. You want to make the deal better for *both of you.* That's why **rule #9 is: understand what the company values.**

How do you figure this out? Well, there are a few good rules of thumb.

First, salary is almost always the hardest thing to give, for a few reasons.

1. It must be paid year after year, so it becomes part of a company's long-term burn rate.
2. It is almost always the thing that people gossip about, so paying someone significantly more salary can cause unrest.
3. It tends to be the most tightly constrained by pay bands, especially at large companies.

So if you want more financial compensation, you should think about structuring as much of it as possible outside of salary. A signing bonus, for example, is easier to give than salary. A signing bonus has the advantage of only needing to be paid once, it gets the candidate excited about joining (because everyone likes wads of cash), and it's generally not as public.

Remember that you can always get salary raises as you continue to work at the company, but there's only one point at which you can get a signing bonus.

The easiest thing for a company to give though is stock (if the company offers stock). Companies like giving stock because it invests you in the company and aligns interests. It also shifts some of the risk from the company over to you and burns less cash.

If you are genuinely risk-neutral or early in your career, then you should generally try to assume as much stock as possible. If you aggressively trade cash for stock, you can end up with a higher expected value offer (albeit with higher risk).

## A Brief Primer on Equity

You can skip this section if you're already pretty familiar with how equity works. I'm going to speaking to the totally uninitiated here, because too many people get swindled when it comes to valuing stock.

First, understand there are two completely different classes of companies: public companies and private companies. If the company is public (i.e., it has IPOed and is listed on the stock market), then its stock is as good as cash. You will usually be granted RSUs (Restricted Stock Units), which are just shares like you can purchase on the stock market. Once these shares vest (that is, are released to you), you can turn around and sell them on the stock market. This is how they turn into money.

If the company is private, then things get a lot more complicated. For private companies, most of the time they will not actually issue you stock grants. Usually, they will issue you stock options. An option is a pre-agreed right to purchase shares of stock at a frozen price.

It's important to note that when you want to leave a company, if you have options, your life becomes really complicated. You may have to pay a bunch of money to actually exercise your option (that is, buy your pre-agreed upon stock at the previous frozen price, or risk losing it), with no way to actually sell it yet. The only way to truly liquidate your options is when the company IPOs or is acquired. And many companies don't ever do either.

Thus, options are very risky. It's easier to get screwed by options, especially on tax implications. For a lot more information, see [this post](http://a16z.com/2016/08/24/options-ownership/) by Scott Kupor of a16z.

## Equity Shenanigans

Many companies will try to play mindgames with you when it comes to equity. Several companies pulled these on me.

A common one is presenting the total value of the stock grant rather than the annualized value, despite the the stock not vesting evenly, or vesting over 5 years instead of the standard 4.

But the most egregious thing that companies will do is tell you absurd stories about the value of their stock. They'll say: &ldquo;okay, we're worth this much now, but at the rate we're growing we're going to be worth 10X that in a year. So really, the value of your options is many millions of dollars!&rdquo;

To not mince words: this is cynically dishonest bullshit. Don't buy it even for a second. I got this a few times, and the only reason I didn't walk away from the offer immediately was because it was always a recruiter pulling this crap. If it was a manager I would've turned down the offer outright.

Here's why this is infuriatingly stuptags: [a company's valuation is determined by investors. These investors see the financials and the growth rate of the company, and invest at a price that **reflects the current growth rate of the company.** In other words, they invested at a valuation that already took their 10x growth rate into account. Investors are not idiots. And unless you (or your recruiter) think you have privileged information or insight that the company's investors don't, you should probably take the investors' word for it.

(Not to mention a company's nominal valuation is almost always inflated due to preferred shares, debt, and survivorship bias, but let's ignore that for now.)

So if a company gives you this hock of crap, fire back and tell them thank you, but you'll be considering the stock at the same valuation their investors valued it at.

I mean, be nice. But don't let them try to strong-arm you into accepting this garbage.

A job is not a suicide pact. Choose a company that is judicious and transparent, and you'll be much more likely to find yourself respected and taken care of.

## Other Things You Can Ask For

Because I'd be remiss if I didn't point out a few other things.

Relocation expenses often come out of separate budgets at big companies, so this is generally very easy to get.

Look for creative benefits that would be particularly valuable to you. Maybe it's covering your commuter expenses, asking for dedicated volunteer or learning time, getting sponsored for conferences, or even charity donation matching.

Don't assume anything's off the table until you've tried bringing it up.

That said, don't throw the entire kitchen sink at them. A negotiation can quickly become cumbersome for an employer if you bring up a litany of changes. Keep the changeset as pithy as you can.

## Negotiating Jiu Jitsu

Recruiters love trying to trick you into ending the negotiation early. They're going to do this relentlessly. Don't fault them for it&mdash;I suspect they can't help themselves.

Just keep breaking out of their shenanigans, and don't let yourself be pressured into ending a negotiation until you're actually ready to make a final decision. This is especially grave if you have multiple offers, and you let one company pressure you into canceling the others. Companies succeed in doing this all the time, so I want to equip you with the skills to jiu jitsu out of these techniques.

Here are two situations you can break out of. (These are both real situations that happened to me during my negotiations, though the numbers and details are invented.)

### Situation 1:

I ask for a 10K increase in signing bonus. The company gets back to me and says,

> That's really tough for us to do. I'm going to try, I think you're worth it, but I can't really go to my boss and fight for you unless she knows you're going to sign. Are you going to sign if I get you that 10K?

You should be thinking: ah, this person is trying to force me to a decision point and take away my negotiating power.

I respond:

> Okay, so what I'm hearing is that you'll have to expend some personal reputation to get me a 10K bonus. If you end up going to bat for me, are you confident you'll be able to get that 10K?

They respond:

>I think I can, it just comes down to you Haseeb. If you're serious about joining us, then I'll go fight for you. But I need to know for sure you'll sign.

Great. Time to Jiu Jitsu.

> That makes sense. Unfortunately I can't commit to signing yet; I'm not yet at the stage where I can make a final decision. Like I told you before, this weekend I'm going to sit down with my family and talk things over with them. Choosing the company I'm going to spend the next few years at is a commitment I take really seriously, and so I want to be sure I'm making a well-considered decision.

> But since you're confident that you can get an extra 10K, let's do this instead: in my mind, I'll pretend this offer is [X + 10K] and as I'm considering my final decision, that's where I'll value it. I know it's tough for you to go and get that from your boss, so I don't want you to do that until I'm certain I'm going to sign.

They then vaguely recant and promptly get approval for the 10K bonus.

### Situation 2:

I ask for a 20% increase in stock package. The hiring manager, knowing that I'm negotiating with other companies, then fires back:

> I want to get this stock package for you. And I know I can, we've got the budget. But before I do that, I need your word on something.

> What's that?

> I need you to give me your word that if I improve your offer, you're not going to just turn around and take our counter-offer to [COMPETITOR_COMPANY] to improve your offer with them.

You should be thinking: so basically they're asking me not to negotiate. Cute.

> Let me see if I understand what you're saying. You are willing to improve my offer, but only if I agree that I won't tell [COMPETITOR] what you're offering me. Is that correct?

> Well no, I can't legally do that. What I mean is&hellip;what I mean is, look. I like you. But if I improve your offer and you just take our offer to [COMPETITOR], you'll be violating my trust.

> Okay, let me be sure I understand you here. If you give me this offer and I tell [COMPETITOR], I will be violating the trust under which you're granting me this improved offer. Is that correct?

> Uhh&hellip;Look. How about this. In my mind, I'm going to go get you this stock package okay? And in my head, I'm going to do it with the assumption that you're the kind of person I think you are, and you're going to consider our offer in its own right and not just shop it around. Fair enough?

I nod. He gets the improved offer. I continue to negotiate. Antics averted.

(In case you're wondering, if he had said &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; I would have turned down the proposal.)

## The Path to Signing

It's not enough to just continually ask for stuff. Companies need to sense that you're actually moving toward a final decision, and not just playing games with them.

Your goal in a negotiation is not to be difficult or elusive. True, you should assert your value and carefully consider your options, but you can do so in a way that's respectful and considerate toward the companies you're talking to.

Don't go dark on people. Be open and communicative. I keep saying be honest and I mean it&mdash;be honest.

Aside: I keep talking about honesty, and you might protest that this is antithetical to my earlier rule of &ldquo;protect information.&rdquo; It's not. True, you should protect information that might weaken your negotiating position, but you should be as communicative as possible about everything else (which is most things).

Negotiating is all about relationship, and communication is the bedrock of any relationship.

This brings me to the **the final rule: be winnable.** This is more than just giving the company the impression that you like them (which you continually should). But more so that you must give any company you're talking to a clear path on how to win you. Don't bullshit them or play stupid games. Be clear and unequivocal with your preferences and timeline.

If there is nothing that a company could do to sign you, or you don't actually want to work for them, then don't negotiate with them. Period.

Don't waste their time or play games for your own purposes. Even if the company isn't your dream company, you must be able to imagine at least some package they could offer you that would make you sign. If not, politely turn them down.

It costs each company money to interview you and to negotiate with you. I didn't negotiate with every company I received an offer from, but if there was one key mistake I made in my job search, it was that I still negotiated with too many (in large part because I didn't think my job search would be successful).

## Making the Final Decision

Okay, it's decision time.

(Yes, you do have to make one.)

Three things to keep in mind here:

1. Be clear about your deadline.
2. Assert your deadline continually.
3. Use your final decision as your trump card.

When you start negotiating you don't have to be clear about your timeline because you probably don't have one yet. But once you get into intermediary stages, you should set for yourself a deadline on which you'll sign. It can be for an arbitrary reason (or no reason at all), but just pre-committing to a deadline will allow you to negotiate more clearly and powerfully.

&ldquo;A weekend with the family.&rdquo; I found works nicely, as it has the added benefit of roping other decision makers in. Then when companies push you to end negotiations early, you can re-assert this deadline.

Companies should all be totally aware of when you're going to make your decision. This will raise the stakes and galvanize negotiations as the deadline approaches.

This deadline also lets you defer your decision while still improving offers. Your narrative should basically be &ldquo;I want to see the strongest offer your company can muster. Then I will go into my cave, meditate for 10 days, and when I emerge I will have decided in my heart which company to join.&rdquo; This gives you enormous power to avoid any on-the-spot decision points or premature promises.

Eventually, deadline day will come. Try to make this a business day (say, a Friday or a Monday) so that you can communicate with recruiters during this day. If a hail mary is going to happen, it'll happen here.

Even if there's only one company in the running, you should always *always* wait until the last day to sign your offer. Yes, even if you're certain you're going to sign and even if it's your dream job. I've seen many scenarios in which offers spontaneously improved as deadlines approached, or a fallen player gets up and presents you the holy grail in the 11th hour. Either way, there's no harm.

Finally, your trump card. Save this for the very end. Your trump card is these words: &ldquo;If you can do X, I will sign.&rdquo; Note, this is NOT &ldquo;If you give me X, the offer will be more compelling blah blah blah.&rdquo; Fuck that. It's time to make a promise.

Every company that's still on the table, let them know what it would take to sign you (unless there's nothing they could do). And when you make the final ask, don't forget reason-giving, even if it's the same reason as before!

> Hi Joel, I've been thinking it over and it's genuinely a really tough decision for me. I loved everyone at [COMPANY] but the one thing that makes it hard for me is the salary. As you know I'm trying to pay off my student loans so salary is really important to me right now. If you can improve the salary by 10K a year, then I'll be totally ready to sign.

With luck, they meet you half-way. Or, with a little more luck, they'll meet you all the way.

And just because I know someone will ask&mdash;yes, once say you're going to sign, you should always sign. Never go back on your word. It's a small world, people talk, and these kind of things will come back to haunt you. (More importantly, never go back on your word because you're the kind of person who never goes back on their word.)

Tell all of the other parties that you've made your final decision. Thank them for the negotiation. If you did it well, they'll usually thank you back, tell you to keep in touch, and to reach out again in a couple years next time you're on the market.

And that's it. You did it! Congratulations! You're still alive, right?

&hellip;You're not moving.

Well, that's fine. It's time to celebrate your new job, you beautiful fool! (Drinks are on you.)

If you got some value out of this article, share it with a friend who'd benefit from it.

I just came home from a vow of silence at a meditation center in northern California. It's a strange feeling coming back to city life after five days of silent meditation.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*W3bSf7ni68rbzw8Wy_tJTg.jpeg)

Looking around at puffing joggers, Christmas wreaths, eager couples waiting outside restaurants, the stop and start of traffic&mdash;it's almost too much for my senses.

The last time I took a vow of silence was 5 years ago. It lasted ten days. I had just walked away from my career as a poker player then. I was lost, confused. I was angry at myself. Entering the veil of silence, I expected to come out the other side with answers.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LXZVHL32G3g">[video]</div>

It was probably the hardest ten days of my life. But when I got to the other side, I emerged with only more questions.

This time feels different. Despite the dark of the winter solstice, I return from my vow of silence with unexpected clarity.

I decided that after I got home, I would write a letter to myself. This is that letter.

These last two years have been a cyclone of change. I've [pledged myself to earning-to-give](https://haseebq.com/why-ive-decided-to-devote-my-career-to-earning-to-give/), I've picked up my life and migrated to San Francisco, I've [shouldered my way into the tech industry](https://haseebq.com/farewell-app-academy-hello-airbnb-part-i/). Now I am a full-time software engineer.

I've been moving so fast, so much has obviously shifted. Yet internally, I still have this old image of myself. I've forgotten to even ask myself&mdash;what do I value now? How has it changed?

I wanted to create a document that I can look back on, to remind myself of my principles. If times are ever tough or I'm feeling stranded, that this letter can be a lodestone to guide me.

Call it a personal manifesto.

Usually when I write blog posts, I write them for other people. This post will be an exception&mdash;I am writing this first and foremost for myself. Nevertheless, I hope that this posts inspires your reflection, and that you might consider how these principles might be useful to you too.

## 1. Live simply.

You already have everything you need.

Simplify. Give things away. Turn down offers for more. Know that you are complete and you don't need more things to live a good life.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*SxUjpFIsHW7t7Iv2k3Nqqw.jpeg)

What a pleasure it is to pack up your life into a few bags and embark on a new life! Allow yourself to do that, again, and again, and again.

Of course, there's no shame in having things. But whatever you have, consider it all borrowed&mdash;and when it must be returned, do it with joy.

## 2. You will always have haters. Ignore them.

If you are passionate, if you are strange, if you defy what most people assume are the rules, you will court haters.

That's fine. Let them hate if that's what they need. Their hate will make you more resilient.

But most of all, you should be thankful that they showed up. Because if they didn't, it would be a sure sign what you were doing was not important.

> You have enemies? Good. That means you've stood up for something, sometime in your life. <div class="source">Winston Churchill</div>

## 3. Fight quietly for the things that matter.

Whether it be the people you love, or the causes that matter to you&mdash;do good work. Be humble. Fight hard, and fight with everything you've got.

Attention or fame can be pleasurable, sometimes even useful. But more often than not, it's a distraction from the real work.

## 4. Give yourself up.

It's not about you. It's about something bigger than you.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2ZlJC9xDCKWjUDj8ufheqA.jpeg)

Give. Contribute. Not just money, or time, but your identity. Make your life about more than just you.

> Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life? <div class="source">Mary Oliver, &ldquo;The Summer Day&rdquo;</div>

## 5. Seek mastery.

Get better.

Work harder.

Practice, study, fumble.

Do this all your life.

Call it passion.

## 6. Be forever a student.

There will always be people who are better, stronger, wiser than you.

When you don't know something, proclaim it out loud. Feverishly seek the answers. Wear out your knees with humbleness. Never let ignorance or shame deter you, because the desire to learn is always noble.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qBuMPCuhUBhdTr2HAmv34g.jpeg)

Go searching for your teachers, and don't give up until you find them.

## 7. Cultivate virtue&mdash;by force, if you have to.

You are a coward. You are fearful, you are lazy, you are selfish. Only once you know this can you begin the work of cultivating virtue.

You are principally what you do. So pledge. Show up. Keep coming back. And when you are too afraid to stay, sometimes you must lock yourself in the room and throw away the key.

## 8. You will find your own way.

Your life, your path, your failures and successes will not look like other people's. Though you will read many books and hear many stories, for better or for worse, their blueprints will not apply to you.

That's fine. You'll do great things, and in your own way. You will forge a path that no one will expect&mdash;not even you.

That's okay. Trust that your path, strange though it will seem, is right for you.

## 9. Build your wings on the way down.

Be smart, be calculated, be careful. But when opportunity arises, steel your nerves and take the leap. If you don't see any risks worth taking, you're not paying attention.

It's okay if you don't know what you're doing&mdash;trust that you'll learn before you hit the floor. And if you crash: brush yourself off, forgive your errors, and try again. This is the only way progress has ever happened.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5a5ovIzCTvdRlNeWns4iuA.jpeg)

## 10. Stay hungry, stay foolish.

You are a little bit crazy. The world needs people like you&mdash;reckless, steaming, hapless dreamers.

So don't give it up. Keep asking for too much. Hunger for the world and everything in it, and don't slow down, no matter what people say.

> Forget safety. Live where you fear to live.
>
> Destroy your reputation. Be notorious.

title: 2016 donations and some thoughts on the \"Muslim Ban\"
tags: [effective altruism, personal]
image: picasso.jpg
---

I was originally planning to write this post reflecting on 2016 and my year-end donations (I know, better late than never). But given the political climate in the U.S. right now, I'm feeling pretty shaken. I don't usually write about politics, but I decided I needed to share a few thoughts.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c9stBEAGF4I">[video]</div>

First, donations.

[Note: for those who don't know my background; I am an effective altruist, and I earn-to-give. This means I entered into the tech industry so I could donate 33% of my pre-tax income to high-impact charities every year. I also blog openly about it.]

I first started earning-to-give when I landed my first job in the tech industry in June 2015. [In 2015 I donated a total of **$21,200**](https://haseebq.com/my-first-year-earning-to-give-a-retrospective/).

In 2016, my donations totaled **$50,600**. My finances this year were little more complicated, but that was my best estimate of 33% of my pre-tax income. (That income does not include RSUs; whenever I can liquidate them, I will also donate 33% of their value.)

Below are the organizations I donated to and why.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LqhZqp3zTN9D6CJsnoSPSQ.png)

## The Against Malaria Foundation

*Donation: $12,650 (25%)*

[The Against Malaria Foundation](https://www.againstmalaria.com/) distributes low-cost anti-mosquito bednets in parts of Africa that are ravaged by malaria. AMF has been repeatedly ranked by Givewell as the dollar-for-dollar most impactful charity in the world.

It's important to make speculative and high-risk altruistic investments. But there is some straightforward value in just rewarding and spreading the word about organizations that rock at saving lives (and in the worst case, to have no doubt that one's donations are having real positive impact). I also donated to them in 2015, and good chance I'll donate again in 2017.

![](http://cvox.imgix.net/images/campaign_11046/583756b782eb1_55d0e028cfa8836684be9b40a670736b.png?ixjsv=2.2.3&w=310)

## .impact

*Donation: $12,650 (25%)*

[.impact](http://dotimpact.im/) is a grassroots EA organization that maintains a lot of Effective Altruism's infrastructure, including the [EA Forum](http://effective-altruism.com/) (which I highly recommend). One of their most exciting projects is LEAN (Local Effective Altruism Network), which helps to seed and support university EA organizations. I also donated to them in 2015.

Young people have already shown that in many ways they are going to be the primary vector for change in this world. And as those young people come into power, I'd love to see more of them thinking rigorously about how to do good. 

In short, I think influencing more young people to think critically about effectiveness is one of our best levers for ensuring a positive future.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_IkNmLi8VpyThIYZCUNdMA.png)

## 80,000 Hours

*Donation: $25,300 (50%)*

My largest donation this year was to [80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/) (80K). 80K is an organization that advises young people on how to do the most good with their careers. They analyze different career paths, balancing career capital with altruistic aims.

80K actually strongly affected my own trajectory when I was considering career pursuits. Reading through their career guide on tech entrepreneurship influenced my original decision to enter into the tech industry.

[80K has had had impressive growth and has done a lot of good for influencing more students on the path to altruistic lives](https://80000hours.org/2016/12/annual-review-dec-2016/). There's a big talent gap in effective altruism right now, and 80K seems like the best investment for filling that gap. I'm excited to see what they can do in 2017.

So that wraps up my donations. Now I'd like to do what I normally never do, and say a few words about the political climate in the U.S.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LeEPFvCBl6u638r_dsvViA.png)

## Authoritarianism, walls, and the &ldquo;Muslim Ban&rdquo;

Far more capable minds than mine have spilled enough ink on this topic, so I'm going to keep my words brief.

Things are moving faster than anyone expected. But history has seen this before. **Our environment is likely to change fast, and unpredictably.**

Keep your eyes open. Be vigilant. Know your power and use it wisely, and where you have none, stay safe.

It's a scary and saddening time. History books will struggle to make sense of this. And when we are old, we will look back and talk with shame about the barbarism that America, for a time, succumbed to.

But I am optimistic. When I see the protests happening across the U.S. and around the world, the international condemnation of these regressive and protectionist policies, when I see the power and fury of a culture founded on inclusion and love&mdash;it gives me confidence.

The world is changing. Though we may have stumbled, we are going to take two steps forward.

I, for one, am going to keep fighting in my own way. 

I hope you do the same.

title: The Time I Had to Crack My Own Reddit Password
tags: [personal, programming]
image: hackers.jpg
---

**I have no self-control.**

Luckily, I know this about myself. This allows me to consciously engineer my life so that despite having the emotional maturity of a heroin-addicted lab rat, I'm occasionally able to get things done.

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/gOH54eiriYIwM/giphy.gif">
<div class="caption">Mm, a waste of time!</div>

I waste a lot of time on Reddit. If I want to procrastinate on something, I'll often open a new tab and dive down a Reddit-hole. But sometimes one needs to turn on the blinders and dial down distractions. 2015 was one of these times&mdash;I was singularly focused on improving as a programmer, and Redditing was becoming a liability.

I needed an abstinence plan.

So it occurred to me: how about I lock myself out of my account? 

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zI-riJZiY7s">[video]</div>

## Here's what I did:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*8Zpw3ipnu92ehqA_6T-o8w.gif)

I set a random password on my account. Then I asked a friend to e-mail me this password on a certain date. With that, I'd have a foolproof way to lock myself out of Reddit. (Also changed the e-mail for password recovery to cover all the bases.)

This should have worked.

Unfortunately it turns out, friends are very susceptible to social engineering. The technical terminology for this is that they are &ldquo;nice to you&rdquo; and will give you back your password if you &ldquo;beg them.&rdquo;

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/uB6rsQFg5yPzW/giphy.gif)

After a few rounds of this failure mode, I needed a more robust solution. A little Google searching, and I came across this:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*iMtDCzvNYVF9UOeiIbU7Ww.png)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*7QCLp-4HnnDwgj1FSnRstw.png)
<div class="caption">(Looks legit.)</div>

Perfect&mdash;an automated, friend-less solution! (I'd alienated most of them by now, so that was a big selling point.)

A bit sketchy looking, but hey, any port in a storm.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TOUIDOIRHiVySUWt46n3mw.gif)

For a while I set this up this routine&mdash;during the week I'd e-mail myself my password, on the weekends I'd receive the password, load up on internet junk food, and then lock myself out again once the week began. It worked quite well from what I remember.

Eventually I got so busy with programming stuff, I completely forgot about it.

## Cut to two years later.

I'm now gainfully employed at Airbnb. And Airbnb, it so happens, has a large test suite. This means waiting, and waiting of course means internet rabbit holes.

I decide to scrounge up my old account and find my Reddit password.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sAr_MYJtJVkNq6uHiVQxtQ.gif)

Oh. *Oh. Oh shit.*

I didn't remember doing this, but I must have gotten so fed up with myself that **I locked myself out until 2018**. I also set it to &ldquo;hide,&rdquo; so I couldn't view the contents of the e-mail until it's sent.

What do I do? Do I just have to create a new Reddit account and start from scratch? But that's *so much work.*

I could write in to LetterMeLater and explain that I didn't mean to do this. But they would probably take a while to get back to me. We've already established I'm wildly impatient. Plus this site doesn't look like it has a support team. Not to mention it would be an embarrassing e-mail exchange. I started brainstorming elaborate explanations involving dead relatives about why I needed access to the e-mail…

All of my options were messy. I was walking home that night from the office pondering my predicament, when suddenly it hit me.

**The search bar.**

I pulled up the app on my mobile phone and tried it:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DvLUtm_ZGOaTGKy1bOuyYQ.gif)

Hmm.

Okay. So it's indexing the subject for sure. What about the body?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*esw6gkV0G-M1JKaPAqipLA.gif)

I try a few letters, and voila. It's definitely got the body indexed. Remember: the body consisted entirely of my password.

*Essentially, I've been given an interface to perform substring queries.* By entering in a string into the search bar, the search results will confirm whether my password contains this substring.

**We're in business.**

I hurry into my apartment, drop my bag, and pull out my laptop.

Algorithms problem: you are given a function `substring?(str)`, which returns true or false depending on whether a password contains any given substring. *Given this function, write an algorithm that can deduce the hidden password.*

## The Algorithm

So let's think about this. A few things I know about my password: I know it was a long string with some random characters, probably something along the lines of `asgoihej2409g`. I *probably* didn't include any upper-case characters (and Reddit doesn't enforce that as a password constraint) so let's assume for now that I didn't&mdash;in case I did, we can just expand the search space later if the initial algorithm fails.

We also have a subject line as part of the string we're querying. And we know the subject is &ldquo;password&rdquo;.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XvaVCyWtSdqKSz59HKnNDw.png)

Let's pretend the body is 6 characters long. So we've got six slots of characters, some of which may appear in the subject line, some of which certainly don't. So if we take all of the characters that aren't in the subject and try searching for each of them, we know for sure we'll hit a unique letter that's in the password. Think like a game of Wheel of Fortune.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LOzh--_Ujutrh_OKhjfNaw.png)

We keep trying letters one by one until we hit a match for something that's not in our subject line. Say we hit it.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fdoVAq3t5naQ5G9yARr0RA.png)

Once I've found my first letter, I don't actually know where in this string I am. But I know I can start building out a bigger substring by appending different characters to the end of this until I hit another substring match.

We'll potentially have to iterate through every character in our alphabet to find it. Any of those characters could be correct, so on average it'll hit somewhere around the middle, so given an alphabet of size `A`, it should average out to `A/2` guesses per letter (let's assume the subject is small and there are no repeating patterns of 2+ characters).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GJ5xKZzTe0F5un-Iz11pXg.png)

I'll keep building this substring until it eventually hits the end and no characters can extend it further.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*E9ri3Rf8LBPxUTjgs5BvPQ.png)

But that's not enough&mdash;most likely, there will be a prefix to the string that I missed, because I started in a random place. Easy enough: all I have to do is now repeat the process, except going backwards.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*F_n0WGRP_8RJdFtR-v0b1g.png)

Once the process terminates, I should be able to reconstruct the password. In total, I'll need to figure out `L` characters (where `L` is the length), and need to expend on average `A/2` guesses per character (where `A` is the alphabet size), so total guesses = `A/2 \* L`.

To be precise, I also have to add another `2A` to the number of guesses for ascertaining that the string has terminated on each end. So the total is `A/2 \* L + 2A`, which we can factor as `A(L/2 + 2)`.

Let's assume we have 20 characters in our password, and an alphabet consisting of `a-z` (26) and `0–9` (10), so a total alphabet size of 36. So we're looking at an average of `36 \* (20/2 + 2) = 36 \* 12 = 432` iterations.

Damn.

This is actually doable.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/119cVU19ICcAKc/giphy.gif)

## The Implementation

First things first: I need to write a client that can programmatically query the search box. This will serve as my substring oracle. Obviously this site has no API, so I'll need to scrape the website directly.

Looks like the URL format for searching is just a simple query string, `www.lettermelater.com/account.php?**qe=#{query_here}**`. That's easy enough.

Let's start writing this script. I'm going to use the Faraday gem for making web requests, since it has a simple interface that I know well.

I'll start by making an API class.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/b34b7e50009ca20511abaf9e4c7e2aab.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/b34b7e50009ca20511abaf9e4c7e2aab).</noscript>

Of course, we don't expect this to work yet, as our script won't be authenticated into any account. As we can see, the response returns a 302 redirect with an error message provided in the cookie.

```

So how do we sign in? We need to send in our [cookies](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17769011/how-does-cookie-based-authentication-work) in the header, of course. Using Chrome inspector we can trivially grab them.

(Not going to show my real cookie here, obviously. Interestingly, looks like it's storing `user_id` client-side which is always a great sign.)

Through process of elimination, I realize that it needs both `code` and `user_id` to authenticate me&hellip;sigh.

So I add these to the script. (This is a fake cookie, just for illustration.)

It's got my name in there, so we're definitely logged in!

We've got the scraping down, now we just have to parse the result. Luckily, this pretty easy&mdash;we know it's a hit if the e-mail result shows up on the page, so we just need to look for any string that's unique when the result is present. The string &ldquo;password&rdquo; appears nowhere else, so that will do just nicely.=op

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*cZT37Ji9j8sm8dobFpiAWQ.png)

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/4db364c7432730e4f432c3ea3dcac9bc.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/4db364c7432730e4f432c3ea3dcac9bc).</noscript>

That's all we need for our API class. We can now do substring queries entirely in Ruby.

```
[31] pry(main)> Api.include?('password')
=> true
[32] pry(main)> Api.include?('f')
=> false
[33] pry(main)> Api.include?('g')
=> true
```

Now that we know that works, let's stub out the API while we develop our algorithm. Making HTTP requests is going to be really slow and we might trigger some rate-limiting as we're experimenting. If we assume our API is correct, once we get the rest of the algorithm working, everything should just work once we swap the real API back in.

So here's the stubbed API, with a random secret string:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/07630885b15348da15c92835860d5415.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/07630885b15348da15c92835860d5415).</noscript>

We'll inject the stubbed API into the class while we're testing. Then for the final run, we'll use the real API to query for the real password.

So let's get started with this class. From a high level, recalling my algorithm diagram, it goes in three steps:

1. First, find the first letter that's not in the subject but exists in the password. This is our starting off point.
2. Build those letters forward until we fall off the end of the string.
3. Build that substring backwards until we hit the beginning of the string.

Then we're done!

Let's start with initialization. We'll inject the API, and other than that we just need to initialize the current password chunk to be an empty string.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/4cb8aa0c850c6584a584dc76f975dc2f.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/4cb8aa0c850c6584a584dc76f975dc2f).</noscript>

Now let's write three methods, following the steps we outlined.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/ba8b2e06bf9727afe3d10696c786d663.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/ba8b2e06bf9727afe3d10696c786d663).</noscript>

Perfect. Now the rest of the implementation can take place in private methods.

For finding the first letter, we need to iterate over each character in the alphabet that's not contained in the subject. To construct this alphabet, we're going to use `a-z` and `0–9`. Ruby allows us to do this pretty easily with ranges:

```
ALPHABET = (('a'..'z').to_a + ('0'..'9').to_a).shuffle
```

I prefer to shuffle this to remove any bias in the password's letter distribution. This will make our algorithm query `A/2` times on average per character, even if the password is non-randomly distributed.

We also want to set the subject as a constant:

```
SUBJECT = 'password'
```

That's all the setup we need. Now time to write `find_starting_letter`. This needs to iterate through each candidate letter (in the alphabet but not in the subject) until it finds a match.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/32224d08a3c1350dc849521618b0b0ac.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/32224d08a3c1350dc849521618b0b0ac).</noscript>

In testing, looks like this works perfectly:

```
PasswordCracker.new(ApiStub).send(:find_starting_letter!) # => 'f'
```

Now for the heavy lifting.

I'm going to do this recursively, because it makes the structure very elegant.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/3d6ea350690f47790fe8f13b729a00e1.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/3d6ea350690f47790fe8f13b729a00e1).</noscript>

The code is surprisingly straightforward. Let's see if it works with our stub API.

```
[63] pry(main)> PasswordCracker.new(ApiStub).crack!
f
fj
fjp
fjpe
fjpef
fjpefo
fjpefoj
fjpefoj4
fjpefoj49
fjpefoj490
fjpefoj490r
fjpefoj490rj
fjpefoj490rjg
fjpefoj490rjgs
fjpefoj490rjgsd
=> "fjpefoj490rjgsd"
```

Awesome. We've got a suffix, now just to build backward and complete the string. This should look very similar.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/e8fb85d9a9681906e4a0511b1ebfc137.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/e8fb85d9a9681906e4a0511b1ebfc137).</noscript>

In fact, there's only two lines of difference here: how we construct the `guess`, and the name of the recursive call. There's an obvious refactoring here, so let's do it.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/a6f3a62bb3ae96442d6fe13288e3739b.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/a6f3a62bb3ae96442d6fe13288e3739b).</noscript>

Now these other calls simply reduce to:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/192d898aaaff1fed314008f232aaa3cb.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/192d898aaaff1fed314008f232aaa3cb).</noscript>

And let's see how it works in action:

```
Apps-MacBook:password-recovery haseeb$ ruby letter_me_now.rb
Current password: 9
Current password: 90
Current password: 90r
Current password: 90rj
Current password: 90rjg
Current password: 90rjgs
Current password: 90rjgsd
Current password: 90rjgsd
Current password: 490rjgsd
Current password: j490rjgsd
Current password: oj490rjgsd
Current password: foj490rjgsd
Current password: efoj490rjgsd
Current password: pefoj490rjgsd
Current password: jpefoj490rjgsd
Current password: fjpefoj490rjgsd
Current password: pfjpefoj490rjgsd
Current password: hpfjpefoj490rjgsd
Current password: 0hpfjpefoj490rjgsd
Current password: 20hpfjpefoj490rjgsd
Current password: 420hpfjpefoj490rjgsd
Current password: g420hpfjpefoj490rjgsd
g420hpfjpefoj490rjgsd
```

Beautiful. Now let's just add some more print statements and a bit of extra logging, and we'll have our finished `PasswordCracker`.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/a88ef356b59858d6954214122f1f01e8.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/a88ef356b59858d6954214122f1f01e8).</noscript>

And now&hellip;the magic moment. Let's swap the stub with the real API and see what happens.

### The Moment of Truth

Cross your fingers&hellip;

```
PasswordCracker.new(Api).crack!
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NR-y9WthtHg4DVjLDwikVA.gif)
<div class="caption">(Sped up 3x)</div>

Boom. 443 iterations.

Tried it out on Reddit, and login was successful.

Wow.

It&hellip;actually worked.

Recall our original formula for the number of iterations: `A(N/2 + 2)`. The true password was 22 characters, so our formula would estimate `36 \* (22/2 + 2) = 36 \* 13 = 468` iterations. Our real password took 443 iterations, so our estimate was within 5% of the observed runtime.

**Math.**

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/26xBI73gWquCBBCDe/giphy.gif)

**It works.**

Embarrassing support e-mail averted. Reddit rabbit-holing restored. It's now confirmed: programming is, indeed, magic.

(The downside is I am now going to have to find a new technique to lock myself out of my accounts.)

And with that, I'm gonna get back to my internet rabbit-holes. Thanks for reading, and share this if you enjoyed it!

title: Blockchain: the revolution we're not ready for
tags: [blockchain, programming]

---

Imagine you didn't need to trust a stranger to make a deal with them. Imagine you didn't need to trust your bank to deposit your money there. Imagine you didn't need to trust your government to know it was being just and fair.

What would happen?

**It would change the world.**

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k3Zb_4ZOM7M"></div>

This is precisely the promise of blockchains.

Cryptocurrencies, which are built on blockchains, are all over the press these days, mostly because of the high prices, volatility, and sensational narratives surrounding debacles like [Mt. Gox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox) and [The Silk Road](https://www.wired.com/2015/04/silk-road-1/).

But there's something much bigger going on than just digital currencies.

While the mainstream media has been busy speculating about prices and black market intrigues, they've missed the fact that beneath it all, cryptographers had quietly invented an entirely new set of technological primitives.

Blockchains (and the consensus protocols that support them) were invented as a result of cyberpunks trying to solve a bold problem: how to create digital, untraceable money. By combining cryptography, game theory, economics, and computer science, they managed to create an entirely new set of tools for building decentralized systems.

But what they created will change much more than just how we exchange money. It's going to change the entire world. And hardly anyone seems to notice.

Edward Witten, the famous physicist, once said of string theory that it was <q>a part of 21st century physics that fell by chance into the 20th century.</q> In other words, the physics community was not ready for string theory.

**Blockchain is a 22nd century technology that fell by chance into the early 21st century.**

It's painfully obvious that we're not ready for it.

## What is a blockchain?

At its core, a blockchain is a surprisingly simple and elegant data structure. It's basically just a linked list with one important augmentation—each block contains a [cryptographic hash](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) of the previous block. This creates an effectively unalterable chain of blocks and their fingerprints, stretching back to the original block.

![Blockchain](http://i.imgur.com/Ymhi8jq.png)

If everyone in your system replicates this linked list (and verifies its legitimacy by repeating the cryptographic hash functions), it will implement a slow and somewhat crude distributed database that's resistant to tampering.

And that's a blockchain. Doesn't sound that amazing, does it?

Of course, to actually build a functional protocol, you need a lot more than that—you'll need authentication (public/private key cryptography), a consensus mechanism (Nakamoto consensus via proof-of-work or various kinds of proof-of-stake), space and time optimizations (Merkle trees and Merkle proofs), and a bunch of fancy peer-to-peer networking stuff. But that's a subject for another, more technical blog post.

The point is this: **blockchains are a genuinely new tool for organizing complex systems**. And we are only beginning to understand how to integrate them into the real world.

## The promise of blockchains
If everyone works off the same blockchain, and everyone openly shares what the current state of the blockchain is, and it's computationally intractable to tamper with it, and everyone agrees on rules of how new data is committed&hellip; then suddenly everything changes.

Suddenly you can build completely decentralized systems that require no trust among participants. So long as enough actors in the system follow the rules of the protocol (in the most primitive case, at least 50% of them are good), then you can imbue the system with provable security guarantees. Conspiracies or bad actors can't censor or vandalize the system.

You can even engineer the right incentives straight into the protocol, and then have every actor in the system enforce them.

Using blockchains, a lot of massive coordination problems simply disappear. Conundrums that plague global financial infrastructure, voting, international remittances, insurance policies, custodial records, and even government corruption can simply be designed out of existence.

By creating the right system with the right guarantees, you can fix bad incentives. You can eliminate corrupt middle-men and rent-seekers. You can create whole new societies that can coordinate better, more transparently, and more efficiently than ever before considered possible.

**It's really hard for most people to grasp the significance of this.**

I'll put it this way: if John Locke knew about blockchains, it undoubtedly would've compelled him to write a third treatise on government. It would've been a revolutionary idea in how to coordinate a society.

## The future of the future
Most people I know right now in Silicon Valley are focused on deep learning and AI as the most promising technological revolution. And I share their enthusiasm! Deep learning is going to upend industries and give us new capabilities that we only imagined in high science fiction.

But blockchain—blockchain is going to upend entire societies. It's going to enable new kinds of governance systems that were before only the daydreams of utopians and philosophers.

And yet, when you look at the cryptocurrency world right now, you're not necessarily going to recognize that.

Most of what's going on right now falls into two categories.

The first are the crypto-anarchists and hackers who are building low-level protocols. They're racing to build what will become the decentralized TCP/IP stack for future builders.

The second category are the profiteers who trying to make a quick buck off the unaware and the optimistic.

Unfortunately, this second category is getting most of the attention.

## The tower of Blockchain
![tower of Babel](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Pieter_Bruegel_the_Elder_-_The_Tower_of_Babel_%28Vienna%29_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/1200px-Pieter_Bruegel_the_Elder_-_The_Tower_of_Babel_%28Vienna%29_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg)
Imagine stumbling across the world wide web in 1995, browsing through dinky fan sites catering to eccentrics, and thinking: "Hah. Wow. This weird little ecosystem is going to be really important someday."

That was blockchain a few years ago. In other words, blockchain has safely crossed the Angelfire chasm.

Now that it has proven its first glimmer of usefulness, the next act is inevitable.

You may have heard about the [ICO mania](https://medium.com/blockchannel/understanding-the-ethereum-ico-token-hype-429481278f45), or the recent rallies of [the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/). The wise and the wily have taken notice and have realized blockchain's tremendous potential. And they've already made and lost fortunes speculating on the potential future of cryptocurrencies.

![Crypto prices](http://i.imgur.com/OlfsjU9.png)

It's unfortunate that right now, blockchain-as-speculation is dominating most people's attention. The signal is getting drowned in the noise.

But that's to be expected. We've seen this before.

When people first realized the extraordinary potential of the internet, tons of money was pumped into random dot coms. Anticipating mass adoption and astronomical value creation, speculation fed speculation, [until the frenzy finally crashed in 2001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble).

What's going on right now is comparable. There will eventually be a comedown.

But when the dust is cleared, like after the dot com crash, those who were serious—the Microsofts, the Amazons, the Googles—will have to come in and do the graceless work of building the future.

There's much work to do.

I recently left my job at Airbnb. I was working on payments fraud for a little over a year. It was fascinating and impactful work—Airbnb is an awesome company—and I left on good terms. But the more I've been learning about crypto and blockchains, the more I'm convinced that this stuff is going to change the world.

And that's why I'm going to be working on the blockchain. (And probably keep blogging about it!)

For now, thanks for reading.

title: A hacker stole $31M of Ether—how it happened and what it means for Ethereum
tags: [blockchain, programming]
image: /content/images/2017/07/blockchain.png
---

Yesterday, a hacker pulled off the second biggest heist in the history of digital currencies.

Around 12:00 PST, an unknown attacker exploited a critical flaw in the Parity multi-signature wallet on the Ethereum network, draining three massive wallets of over $31,000,000 worth of Ether in a matter of minutes. Given a couple more hours, the hacker could've made off with over $180,000,000 from vulnerable wallets.

But someone stopped them.

![Hacker](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*l0L_X-wFPpb3YHJ0Oqxp_Q.png)

Having sounded the alarm bells, a group of benevolent white-hat hackers from the Ethereum community rapidly organized. They analyzed the attack and realized that there was no way to reverse the thefts, yet many more wallets were vulnerable. Time was of the essence, so they saw only one available option: **hack the remaining wallets before the attacker did.**

By exploiting the same vulnerability, the white-hats [hacked all of the remaining at-risk wallets](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1dba1131000664b884a1ba238464159892252d3a) and drained their accounts, effectively preventing the attacker from reaching any of the remaining $150,000,000.

*Yes, you read that right.*

To prevent the hacker from robbing any more banks, the white-hats wrote software to rob all of the remaining banks in the world. Once the money was safely stolen, they began the process of returning the funds to their respective account holders. The people who had their money saved by this heroic feat are now in the process of retrieving their funds.

It's an extraordinary story, and it has significant implications for the world of cryptocurrencies.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MNIOdEWdqvI">[video]</div>

**It's important to understand that this exploit was not a vulnerability in Ethereum or in Parity itself.** Rather, it was a vulnerability in the default smart contract code that the Parity client gives the user for deploying multi-signature wallets.

This is all pretty complicated, so to make the details of this clear for everyone, this post is broken into three parts:

1. **What exactly happened?** An explanation of Ethereum, smart contracts, and multi-signature wallets.
2. **How did they do it?** A technical explanation of the attack (specifically for programmers).
3. **What now?** The attack's implications about the future and security of smart contracts.

If you are familiar with Ethereum and the crypto world, you can skip to the second section.

## 1. What exactly happened?

There are three building blocks to this story: **Ethereum**, **smart contracts**, and **digital wallets**.

![Ethereum](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*J_yJEaeQXUZ_Wk2w5sQXuQ.png)

**[Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/)** is a digital currency invented in 2013—a full 4 years after the release of Bitcoin. It has since grown to be the second largest digital currency in the world by market cap—$20 billion to Bitcoin's $40 billion.

Like all cryptocurrencies, Ethereum is a descendant of the Bitcoin protocol and improves on Bitcoin's design. But don't be fooled: though it is a digital currency like Bitcoin, Ethereum is much more powerful.

While Bitcoin uses its blockchain to implement a ledger of monetary transactions, Ethereum uses its blockchain to record state transitions in a gigantic distributed computer. Ethereum's corresponding digital currency, `ether` is essentially a side effect of powering this massive computer.

To put it another way, *Ethereum is literally a computer that spans the entire world*. Anyone who runs the Ethereum software on their computer is participating in the operations of this world-computer, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Because the EVM was designed to be [Turing-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) (ignoring gas limits), it can do almost anything that can be expressed in a computer program.

Let me be emphatic: *this is crazy shit*. The crypto world is ebullient about the potential of Ethereum, which has seen its value skyrocket in the last 6 months.

![Ethereum price chart](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*cGo4ezL9EPH_jGqsj3QS_Q.png)

The developer community has rallied behind it, and there's a lot of excitement about what can be built on top of the EVM—and this brings us to smart contracts.

**Smart contracts** are simply computer programs that run on the EVM. In many ways they are like normal contracts, except they don't need lawyers or judges to interpret them. Instead, they are compiled to bytecode and interpreted unambiguously by the EVM. With these programs, you can (among other things) programmatically transfer digital currency based solely on the rules of the contract code.

Of course, there are things normal contracts do that smart contracts can't—smart contracts can't easily interact with things that aren't on the blockchain. But smart contracts can also do things that normal contracts can't, such as enforce a set of rules entirely through unbreakable cryptography.

This leads us to the notion of **wallets**. In the world of digital currencies, wallets are how you store your assets. You gain access to your wallet using essentially a secret password, also known as your private key ([simplified a bit](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/asymmetric-cryptography)). There are many different types of wallets that confer different security properties, such as withdrawal limits. One of the most popular types is the multi-signature wallet.

In a multi-signature wallet, there are several private keys that can unlock the wallet, but just one key is not enough to unlock it. If your multi-signature wallet has 3 keys, for example, you can specify that at least 2 of the 3 keys must be provided to successfully unlock it. This means that if you, your father, and your mother are each signatories on this wallet, even if a criminal hacked your mother and stole her private key, they could still not access your funds. This leads to much stronger security guarantees, so multi-sigs are a standard in wallet security.

This is the type of wallet the hacker attacked.

So what went wrong? Did they break the private keys? Did they use a quantum computer, or some kind of cutting-edge factoring algorithm?

Nope, all the cryptography was sound. The exploit was almost laughably simple: they found a programmer-introduced bug in the code that let them re-initialize the wallet, almost like restoring it to factory settings. Once they did that, they were free to set themselves as the new owners, and then walk out with everything.

## 2. How did this happen?

What follows is a technical explanation of exactly what happened. If you're not a developer, you can skip to the next section, as this is going to be programming-heavy.

Ethereum has a fairly unique programming model. On Ethereum, you write code by publishing contracts (which you can think of as objects), and transactions are executed by calling methods on these objects to mutate their state.

In order to run code on Ethereum, you need to first deploy the contract (the deployment is itself a transaction), which costs a small amount of Ether. You then need to call methods on the contract to interact with it, which costs more Ether. As you can imagine, this incentivizes a programmer to optimize their code, both to minimize transactions and minimize computation costs.

One way to reduce costs is to use libraries. By making your contract call out to a shared library that was deployed at a previous time, you don't have to re-deploy any shared code. In Ethereum, keeping your code DRY will directly save you money.

The default multi-sig wallet in Parity did exactly this. It held a reference to a shared external library which contained wallet initialization logic. This shared library is referenced by the public key of the library contract.

```javascript
// FIELDS
address constant _walletLibrary = 0xa657491c1e7f16adb39b9b60e87bbb8d93988bc3;
```

The library is called in several places, via an EVM instruction called `DELEGATECALL`, which does the following: for whatever method that calls `DELEGATECALL`, it will call the same method on the contract you're delegating to, but using the context of the current contract. It's essentially like a `super` call, except without the inheritance part. (The equivalent in JavaScript would be `OtherClass.functionName.apply(this, args)`.)

Here's an example of this in their multi-sig wallet: the `isOwner` method just delegates to the shared wallet library's `isOwner` method, using the current contract's state.

```javascript
function isOwner(address _addr) constant returns (bool) {
  return _walletLibrary.delegatecall(msg.data);
}
```

This is innocent enough. The multi-sig wallet itself contained all of the right permission checks, and they were sure to rigorously enforce authorization on all sensitive actions related to the wallet's state.

But they made one critical mistake.

Solidity allows you to define a "fallback method". This is the method that gets called when there's no method that matches a given method name. You define it by not giving it a name:

```javascript
function() {
  // do stuff here for all unknown methods
}
```

The Parity team decided to let any unknown method that sent Ether to the contract just default to depositing the sent Ether.

```javascript
function() payable {
  // payable is just a keyword that means this method can receive/pay Ether

  if (msg.value > 0) {
    // just being sent some cash?
    Deposit(msg.sender, msg.value);
  }
  throw;
}
```

But they took it a step further, and herein was their critical mistake. Below is the *actual code that was attacked*.

```javascript
function() payable {
  // just being sent some cash?
  if (msg.value > 0)
    Deposit(msg.sender, msg.value);
  else if (msg.data.length > 0)
    _walletLibrary.delegatecall(msg.data);
}
```

Basically:

* If the method name is not defined on this contract...
* And there's no ether being sent in the transaction...
* And there is some data in the message payload...

Then it will call the exact same method if it's defined in `_walletLibrary`, but in the context of this contract.

Using this, the attacker called a method called `initWallet()`, which was not defined on the multisig contract *but was* defined in the shared wallet library:

```javascript
function initWallet(address[] _owners, uint _required, uint _daylimit) {
  initDaylimit(_daylimit);
  initMultiowned(_owners, _required);
}
```

Which calls the `initMultiowned` method...

```javascript
function initMultiowned(address[] _owners, uint _required) {
  m_numOwners = _owners.length + 1;
  m_owners[1] = uint(msg.sender);
  m_ownerIndex[uint(msg.sender)] = 1;
  for (uint i = 0; i < _owners.length; ++i)
  {
    m_owners[2 + i] = uint(_owners[i]);
    m_ownerIndex[uint(_owners[i])] = 2 + i;
  }
  m_required = _required;
}
```

Do you see what just happened there? The attacker essentially **reinitialized the contract** by delegating through the library method, overwriting the owners on the original contract. They and whatever array of owners they supply as arguments will be the new owners.

Given that they now control the entire wallet, they can trivially extract the remainder of the balance. And that's precisely what they did.

The initWallet: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x707aabc2f24d756480330b75fb4890ef6b8a26ce0554ec80e3d8ab105e63db07

The transfer:
https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9654a93939e98ce84f09038b9855b099da38863b3c2e0e04fd59a540de1cb1e5

So what was ultimately the vulnerability? You could argue there were two. First, the `initWallet` and `initMultiowned` in the wallet library were not marked as `internal` (this is like a `private` method, which would prevent this delegated call), and those methods did not check that the wallet wasn't already initialized. Either check would've made this hack impossible.

The second vulnerability was the raw `delegateCall`. You can think of this as equivalent to a raw `eval` statement, running on a user-supplied string. In an attempt to be succinct, this contract used metaprogramming to proxy potential method calls to an underlying library. The safer approach here would be to whitelist specific methods that the user is allowed to call.

The trouble, of course, is that this is more expensive in gas costs (since it has to evaluate more conditionals). But when it comes to security, we probably have to get over this concern when writing smart contracts that move massive amounts of money.

*So that was the attack.*

It was a clever catch, but once you point it out, it seems almost elementary. The attacker then jumped on this vulnerability for three of the largest wallets they could find—but judging from the transaction times, they were doing this entirely manually. The white-hat group was doing this at scale using scripts, and that's why they were able to beat the attacker to the punch. Given this, it's unlikely that the attacker was very sophisticated in how they planned their attack.

You might ask the question though—why don't they just roll back this hack, like they did with the [DAO hack](https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/the-dao-the-hack-the-soft-fork-and-the-hard-fork/)?

Unfortunately that's not really possible. The DAO hack was unique in that when the attacker drained the DAO into a child DAO, the funds were frozen for many days inside a smart contract before they could be released to the attacker.

This prevented any of the stolen funds from going into circulation, so the stolen Ether was effectively siloed. This gave the Ethereum community plenty of time to conduct a public quorum about how to deal with the attack.

In this attack, the attacker immediately stole the funds and could start spending them. A hard fork would be impractical–what do you do about all of the transactions that occur downstream? What about the people who innocently traded assets with the attacker? Once the ether they've stolen gets laundered and enters general circulation, it's like counterfeit bills circulating in the economy—it's easy to stop when it's all in one briefcase, but once everyone's potentially holding a counterfeit bill, you can't really turn back the clock anymore.

So the transaction won't get reversed. The $31M loss stands. It's a costly, but necessary lesson.

So what should we take away from this?

## 3. What does this attack mean for Ethereum?

There are several important takeaways here.

**First, remember, this was not a flaw in Ethereum or in smart contracts in general. Rather, it was a developer error in a particular contract.**

So who were the crackpot developers who wrote this? They should've known better, right?

[The developers here](https://blog.parity.io/the-multi-sig-hack-a-postmortem/) were a cross-collaboration between the Ethereum foundation (literally the creators of Ethereum), the Parity core team, and members of the open-source community. It underwent extensive peer review. This is basically the highest standard of programming that exists in the Ethereum ecosystem.

These developers were human. They made a mistake. And so did the reviewers who audited this code.

I've read some comments on Reddit and HackerNews along the lines of: "What an obvious mistake! How was it even possible they missed this?" (Ignoring that the "obvious" vulnerability was introduced in January and only now discovered.)

When I see responses like this, I know the people commenting are not professional developers. For a serious developer, the reaction is instead: *damn, that was a dumb mistake. I'm glad I wasn't the one who made it.*

Mistakes of this sort are **routinely** made in programming. All programs carry the risk of developer error. We have to throw off the mindset of "if they were just more careful, this wouldn't have happened." At a certain scale, carefulness is not enough.

As programs scale to non-trivial complexity, you have to start taking it as a *given* that programs are probably not correct. No amount of human diligence or testing is sufficient to prevent all possible bugs. Even organizations like Google or NASA make programming mistakes, despite the extreme rigor they apply to their most critical code.

We would do well to take a page from site reliability practices at companies like Google and Airbnb. Whenever there's a production bug or outage, they do a postmortem analysis and distribute it within the company. In these postmortems, there is always a principle of *never blaming individuals*.

Blaming mistakes on individuals is pointless, because all programmers, no matter how experienced, have a nonzero likelihood of making a mistake. Instead, the purpose of a postmortem is to identify what in the process allowed that mistake to get deployed.

The problem was not that the developer forgot to add `internal` to the wallet library, or that they did a raw `delegateCall` without checking what method was being called.

**The problem is that their programming toolchain allowed them to make these mistakes.**

As the smart contract ecosystem evolves, it has to evolve in the direction of making these mistakes harder, and that means making contracts secure by default.

This leads me to my next point.

**Strength is a weakness** when it comes to programming languages. The stronger and more expressive a programming language is, the more complex its code becomes. Solidity is a very complex language, modeled to resemble Java.

*Complexity is the enemy of security*. Complex programs are more difficult to reason about and harder to identify edge cases for. I think that languages like [Viper](https://github.com/ethereum/viper) (maintained by Vitalik Buterin) are a promising step in this direction. Viper includes by default basic security mechanisms, such as bounded looping constructs, no integer overflows, and prevents other basic bugs that developers shouldn't have to reason about.

The less the language lets you do, the easier it is to analyze and prove properties of a contract. Security is hard because the only way to prove a positive statement like "this contract is secure" is to disprove every possible attack vector: "this contract cannot be re-initialized," "its funds cannot be accessed except by the owners," etc. The fewer possible attack vectors you have to consider, the easier it is to develop a secure contract.

A simpler programming model also allows things like [formal verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification) and automatic test generation. These are areas under active research, but just as smart contracts have incorporated cutting-edge cryptography, they also should start incorporating the leading edge of programming language design.

There is a bigger lesson here too.

Most of the programmers who are getting into this space, myself included, come from a web development background, and the blockchain toolchain is designed to be familiar for web developers. Solidity has achieved tremendous adoption in the developer community because of its familiarity to other forms of programming. In a way, this may end up being its downfall.

The problem is, **blockchain programming is fundamentally different from web development**.

Let me explain.

Before the age of the client-server web model, most programming was done for packaged consumer software or on embedded systems. This was before the day of automatic software updates. In these programs, a shipped product was final—you released one form of your software every 6 months, and if there was a bug, that bug would have to stand until the next release. Because of this longer development cycle, all software releases were rigorously tested under all conceivable circumstances.

Web development is far more forgiving. When you push bad code to a web server, it's not a big deal if there's a critical mistake—you can just roll back the code, or roll forward with a fix, and all is well because you control the server. Or if the worst happens and there's an active breach or a data leak, you can always stop the bleeding by shutting off your servers and disconnecting yourself from the network.

*These two development models are fundamentally different.* It's only out of something like web development that you can get the motto "move fast and break things."

Most programmers today are trained on the web development model. Unfortunately, the blockchain security model is more akin to the older model.

In blockchain, code is intrinsically unrevertible. Once you deploy a bad smart contract, anyone is free to attack it as long and hard as they can, and there's no way to take it back if they get to it first. Unless you build intelligent security mechanisms into your contracts, if there's a bug or successful attack, there's no way to shut off your servers and fix the mistake. Being on Ethereum by definition means *everyone* owns your server.

A common saying in cybersecurity is "attack is always easier than defense." Blockchain sharply multiplies this imbalance. It's far easier to attack because you have access to the code of every contract, know how much money is in it, and can take as long as you want to try to attack it. And once your attack is successful, you can potentially steal *all of the money* in the contract.

Imagine that you were deploying software for vending machines. But instead of a bug allowing you to simply steal candy from one machine, the bug allowed you to simultaneously steal candy from every machine in the world that employed this software. Yeah, that's how blockchain works.

In the case of a successful attack, defense is extremely difficult. The white-hats in the Parity hack demonstrated how limited their defense options were—there was no way to secure or dismantle the contracts, or even to hack back the stolen money; all they could do was hack the remaining vulnerable contracts before the attacker did.

This might seem to spell a dark future.

*But I don't think this is a death knell for blockchain programming.* Rather, it confirms what everyone already knows: this ecosystem is young and immature. It's going to take a lot of work to develop the training and discipline to treat smart contracts the way that banks treat their ATM software. But we're going to have to get there for blockchain to be successful in the long run.

This means not just programmers maturing and getting more training. It also means developing tools and languages that make all of this easier, and give us rigorous guarantees about our code.

It's still early. Ethereum is a work in progress, and it's changing rapidly. You should not treat Ethereum as a bank or as a replacement for financial infrastructure. And certainly you should not store any money in a [hot wallet](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hot_wallet) that you're not comfortable losing.

But despite all that, I still think Ethereum is going to win in the long run. And here's why: **the developer community in Ethereum is what makes it so powerful**.

Ethereum will not live or die because of the money in it. It will live or die based on the developers who are fighting for it.

The league of white-hats who came together and defended the vulnerable wallets didn't do it for money. They did it because they believe in this ecosystem. They want Ethereum to thrive. They want to see their vision of the future come true. And after all the speculation and the profiteering, it's ultimately these people who are going to usher the community into its future. They are fundamentally why Ethereum will win in the long run—or if they abandon Ethereum, their abandonment will be why it loses.

This attack is important. It will shake people up. It will force the community to take a long, hard look at security best practices. It will force developers to treat smart contract programming with far more rigor than they currently do.

But this attack hasn't shaken the strength of the builders who are working on this stuff. So in that sense it's a temporary setback.

In the end, attacks like this are good for the community to grow up. They call you to your senses and force you to keep your eyes open. It hurts, and the press will likely make a mess of the story. But every wound makes the community stronger, and gets us closer to really deeply understanding the technology of blockchain—both its dangers, and its amazing potential.

P.S. If you’re a dev and you want to learn more about smart contract security, [this is a really good resource](https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices#known-attacks).

*Errata: This article originally said that Gavin Wood was the developer of the contract, which is incorrect. Gavin is the founder of Parity and pushed the fix to the contract, but was not the original developer. It also originally claimed that $77M additional funds were vulnerable, but this doesn’t count all of the ERC20 (ICO) tokens that were vulnerable. The total amount is actually $150,000,000+ if you include all ERC20 tokens. As of the time of writing this (July 21st 4PM EST), the total value of the assets saved by the white-hats was $179,704,659.*

title: The Limits of Poker Theory
tags: [poker]

---

&ldquo;Poker theory&rdquo; is inherently seductive. In a game full of chaos and uncertainty, poker theory beckons to us, promising comprehensibility and control. But while theory is powerful, it is not a panacea. That's not to say that theory in and of itself is flawed&mdash;rather, that *we* are.

Human beings are only boundedly rational. We are merely approximations of logical thinkers. And yet, we often take it for granted that in any situation, theory will show us a path to the answer.

In this article, we will analyze the limits of poker logic. First, we will look at the nature of heuristics and the function it plays in our cognition. Then we will begin to trace the boundaries of poker language, establish the difference between narrative and discrete poker logic, and lastly, deconstruct the way that poker arguments work in the real world.

It is critically important that we are attentive to our language, and the way we use concepts to guide our decisions. There is a temptation to think about theory in poker the same way one thinks of theory in physics, or some other hard science. By the end of this article, I will demonstrate that theory, for the most part, serves a profoundly weaker (and ultimately different) function in poker.

## The Power of Heuristics

Most of our play in poker is unconscious. This is true even when we are playing our A-games.

We have spoken before of playing on &ldquo;autopilot,&rdquo; as though autopilot is a deviation from your normal poker game. To be more exact, autopilot is more like the *skeleton* of your normal game. Your &ldquo;autopilot&rdquo;&mdash;that is, your unconsciously competent skillset&mdash;is always running in the background when you're playing poker. It's just that when you're on your A-game, there's a lot of conscious activity buzzing on the topmost layer. But your unconscious autopilot is always running beneath it; that remains constant, even when you're playing really well.

Our attention, then, is with that topmost layer&mdash;what is filled into the skeleton when we are consciously thinking about our play. Several things change when we are playing well, including our employment of skills that we haven't unconsciously mastered, frequently accompanied by an increase in patience, but that's not what we're going to focus on now. Instead, we want to look at the stream of internal dialogue that is running through our head.

The chief characteristic of poker theory is that it is mediated through language. So any engagement with poker theory will almost always be processed through our conscious brain. (To be more exact, it is mediated by symbols, including mathematical and linguistic ones).

When we are on our A-game, we are constantly invoking **heuristics**. A heuristic is, to put it simply, a kind of rule of thumb. It is a not-quite-perfect-but-good-enough script that we follow and usually gives us good results. A practical (albeit rather specific) heuristic would be something like, &ldquo;don't check-raise bluff a board like A49r, just float it,&rdquo; or &ldquo;never c-bet air on QT7s,&rdquo; or something more general, such as &ldquo;in a SA/WB situation, try to minimize the pot size.&rdquo; A heuristic is not a mental breakdown of a hand&mdash;it is merely a prefabricated rule to help you get to the answer to a hand that you don't know on an unconscious level.

How do we know when we're using a heuristic, rather than &ldquo;just making plays&rdquo;? After all, we are constantly making good decisions in poker when autopiloting. Most of those decisions are purely unconscious. The mark of using a heuristic rather than merely using our poker perception is that there will usually be some conscious, linguistic thinking involved. If the phrase &ldquo;SA/WB&rdquo; pops into your head, or &ldquo;draw-heavy,&rdquo; or whatever mental language that you happen to use to describe these situations&mdash;this is an indicator that you're invoking a heuristic. They don't always have to be explicitly linguistic; they may be merely symbolic. But for the most part, if you're paying attention, it's easy to spot when you're using a heuristic.

Heuristics are ubiquitous in how we play poker. For every spot where we haven't achieved unconscious mastery, it would take impractically long for us to fully process every scenario and figure out the best play. Heuristics are, in a sense, pre-formulated, simplified rules that help us quickly process many of these situations and approximate the best answer. They work pretty well most of the time. But because they are so widespread, we must be very attentive to how we use them. Bad, unexamined heuristics are often the source of some of our most consistent mistakes.

For example, one heuristic I inattentively used for a long time related to overbets. Whenever a good player overbet, I almost always assumed they were valuebetting. If you asked me why I assumed this, I likely would've cited the language that went along with my heuristic: &ldquo;an overbet is a risky and unpredictable bet, so people usually make it when they're sure of their hand.&rdquo;

Now, certainly, this qualifies as a rationale. It is poker-logical, so to speak. But it's important to note that I wasn't *thinking this through* every time I folded to an overbet. I was simply consulting this heuristic that I had and applying it (or, after long enough, not even remembering the heuristic and simply unconsciously folding to overbets because I perceived them as strong). Consulting a heuristic is a mental shortcut; it simplifies the processing of a hand to conserve our mental energy, which is always limited when playing a long session, multi-tabling, or battling a difficult opponent. But such a lack of reflection makes heuristics an easy place to solidify bad play. In reality, good players *were* overbetting me with bluffs, but because my heuristic was so entrenched, it took me some time to realize this and discard it.

Every player has some of his consistent mistakes and biases embedded into his arsenal of heuristics. This is why creativity and defying your mental walls are so important: in order to break your suboptimal heuristics (which are usually quite old and deeply ingrained), you must go over them with a magnifying glass, to *really* see them for what they are, and then to systematically challenge them. To become a great poker player, you must constantly put your heuristics under assault, and replace old heuristics with newer and sturdier ones.

## Not all Theory is Created Equal

We might say that heuristics are prefabricated molds of theory. They are not theory in and of themselves; heuristics are static. We don't &ldquo;do&rdquo; heuristics, we merely remember them. But they usually derive from theory in some way. So now let's turn to theory itself.

There are two fundamental types of theory. The first is **discrete theory**. Discrete theory is the type of theory that you likely think about when you imagine poker theory. It is discrete, mathematical, and involves things like delineating hand ranges, combinatorials, GTO analysis, breakdowns of stats, and so on. It's the type of thing you do in PokerEV or PokerStove. It involves math, modeling, and explicit assumptions.

Contrary to the popular image, discrete theory is a miniscule part of the poker theory that we actually use.

By far, the largest chunk of poker theory we use is not discrete. It is rather what I call **narrative theory**. Narrative theory is *not* mathematical, but descriptive. It tells a story. It is not scientific, logical, or deterministic&mdash;it is literary. A narrative does not outline all of its assumptions or convert a hand into an analytical model. Instead, it uses established conventions to tell a narrative that leads toward the answer. Narrative theory lies somewhere between heuristic and discrete theory. And it is, by far, the most commonly used type of theory. I would conjecture that almost all of the theoretical thinking that we engage in is narrative. And yet, few acknowledge its role in shaping our approach to poker.

It is comforting to pretend that all theory is equally robust. But if it is true that the vast majority of poker thinking is narrative rather than discrete, then our faith in the comprehensibility of poker is unearned. It suggests that the vast majority of poker theory (and our understanding of this game) is *not* necessarily scientific, logical, or deterministic. Poker becomes more an art than a science. And that is a deeply uncomfortable thought for those who want to believe in the chess game of poker.

## The Arc of Narrative Theory

Take this nugget of theory, taken from an actual explanation of a poker hand (the context is unimportant): &ldquo;His range here is weak, and he just lost a couple big pots, so this is a good spot to bluff.&rdquo; This seems on its face like valid reasoning, doesn't it? This is a very typical example of what is going through our heads when we're thinking about poker&mdash;and this is also very typical narrative theory.

Narrative theory has a few hallmarks:

- It is not immediately&mdash;or sometimes ever–falsifiable. That is, it's difficult to point out a single fact that proves any narrative to be incorrect.
- It tends not to explicitly state the assumptions and variables on which it hinges.
- It tends to be much more concise than discrete theory.

To discretely analyze a spot involves complex math, the mapping of assumptions and forking paths through a hand. Narrative theory collapses these complexities. And, as it turns out, that is precisely where its strength lies.

Let's go back to that original explanation. &ldquo;His range here is weak, and he just lost a couple big pots, so this is a good spot to bluff.&rdquo; But let's say that perhaps the opponent knows his range is weak, and thus will be calling more. Or, what if losing big pots is going to make him more call-y? These are two possible counter-narratives that would directly challenge this one. The question is this: how do we decide between them? There are no numbers to compare, nothing to multiply or divide, no pot odds to analyze. How do we decide between the first narrative: &ldquo;villains who just lost big pots tend to call more,&rdquo; and &ldquo;villains who just lost big pots tend to give up more&rdquo;? In a very real way, both of these are valid. If the line of reasoning went, instead: &ldquo;his range here is weak, but he knows that and he just lost a couple big pots, so he's likely to call down light here,&rdquo; this story would also sound rather convincing, wouldn't it?

It can be infuriating, but such ambiguity is inherent to the nature of narrative theory. The strength of narrative theory is its ability to transform a hand into a story&mdash;a simplified narrative that efficiently organizes and condenses the information in a hand. Imagine if we laid out all of the assumptions behind something like &ldquo;I'm going to slowplay my set here because a raise would look too strong.&rdquo; We'd have to first say what his range is going into this hand, what our range is, how we think he'll perceive a turn flat, the likelihood that he'll bluff or valuebet any given river card, how he is going to react to a turn raise, and so on and so forth. Really, when it comes down to it, actually *breaking down* a hand is enormously complex. It involves a lot of paperwork. Narrative theory is, in a sense, a kind of deferral. A form of shorthand.

Behind narrative theory lies the claim, &ldquo;there is some discrete theory that justifies this. I don't have it on me, and I can't show it to you now, but it exists somewhere.&rdquo; Actually doing that discrete theory during a poker hand would be prohibitively taxing, in terms of mental processing and of time. We can't discretely analyze every hand we play. So we must take shortcuts. Narrative theory is the only practical way that we, as human beings, can efficiently organize and recall our knowledge of poker theory.

But how do we actually *generate* a thread of narrative theory?

Narrative theory is composed of building blocks, which we might call **poker memes**. Things like &ldquo;checking back for pot control,&rdquo; or &ldquo;maximizing stack-to-pot ratio,&rdquo; or &ldquo;extracting max value,&rdquo; or &ldquo;betting to induce a bluff.&rdquo; These memes describe interpretations of events in a hand which we, poker theory users, view as valid. That is, these are things that really happen in a hand&mdash;they have a discrete theoretical basis. That does not mean that they happened in *this particular hand you're describing*, but we all agree those are things that happen. They are valid memes. Here are some (usually) invalid memes: &ldquo;I raised for information,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I bet because he was challenging me,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I folded because the hand might be tricky.&rdquo; We don't consider these reasons to be grounded in discrete theory, so we dismiss them. As you can imagine, the language of valid narrative theory has changed as poker has evolved.

Thus, narrative theory is a social phenomenon. It is created by the community of poker players who want to talk about poker, and it is through the poker community that we regulate what is valid narrative theory and what is not. They have a genetic quality&mdash;generally, very strong players (especially vocal ones who make videos or talk openly about their poker thinking) create new memes and foreclose less useful ones, and most other players tend to follow their example. Thus, changes in narrative theory disseminate through the poker community, *not through poker itself*, not through playing or changes in gameplay, but in *social and linguistic changes* that are amplified by prominent community members.

Narrative theory is, in a way, much more interesting and organic than discrete theory. Discrete theory should be the same for two people a world apart, even if they're in totally different player pools. But narrative theory is always different. It is fluid and changing. It adapts to the needs and worldviews of its users. Reading a forum thread from top players just five or six years ago reveals just how much narrative theory has changed in recent years.

For my own part, one realization that came to me later on in my poker career was this: one of the most valuable things that is communicated through poker videos (and the reason why they're invaluable for learning) is that they are so good at teaching narrative theory. In fact, most of what I think I gave away in all of the videos I was making was not actually my poker strategy, or the individual plays I made. I think the usefulness of my videos lay, instead, in *how* I talked about poker. Think about it. There are some videos that discretely analyze situations in hands, break things down into math and PokerEV and so on, but really, they are the minority&mdash;the majority of videos see a hand, quickly give a narrative explanation, and then move on.

Of course, once you start to see this, your instinct might be to think that you're getting ripped off. Discrete theory is what you really want, isn't it? On the contrary. One of the most powerful things we learn from videos is *how better to apply narrative theory*.

Narrative theory is much more important than discrete theory when it comes to regulating our play because we rarely have the time to apply discrete theory during an actual hand! If 95% of our play is regulated by narrative theory, then simply being able to listen to other people's narrative theory, examining and regurgitating their language, and internalizing the *rules* with which they combine and chain together memes, we learn to become better at narrative theory. If Phil Galfond checks back top pair on a flop, his breaking down the math and discretely analyzing the hand is, actually, of little value. But what is immensely valuable is learning the memes, the rules of narrative theory that Phil Galfond is applying, and learning to apply them yourself. It is a curious thing&mdash;you take a bad player, teach him to simply *talk* about poker better, and he suddenly becomes a better player.

Narrative theory is not deterministic. By learning the language of a better player, such as a coach or a videomaker, you won't necessarily play like him. But listening to and engaging with such a coach may teach you how to tell stories like him&mdash;a concept known in psychology as **scaffolding**. Your coach's style of narrative theory emphasizes the a particular hierarchy of concepts&mdash;embedded within his language is his idea of what concepts are most important in a hand, which things to look for first, and which patterns should trigger which responses. In the same way our parents engage in scaffolding to teach us how to tell stories as children (e.g., &ldquo;and why did Billy do that? How did that make you feel? And then what did you do?&rdquo;), getting coaching and watching videos guides us toward constructing good poker narratives in much the same way.

It would be incorrect to claim, however, that narrative theory is *all* that we're doing when we're playing poker. There is also some discrete theory involved, especially as your game improves to a high level. Estimating pot odds, analyzing how to optimize against a given hand (given certain assumptions about his play), logical hand-elimination to narrow down his range, or even holistically strategizing on how to allocate your hand range in a certain spot&mdash;these things may well fall under the purview of discrete theory, which strong players are continually applying during their play. But no matter what level you're at, narrative theory is always the dominant mode of theory we employ in poker hands. There is simply no other method as efficient at encoding the large swathes of information contained in poker. Narrative theory is, in a very real sense, the human answer to complexity.

## Arguing over Stories

So let's say that you begrudgingly accept the validity of narrative theory as I've presented it. Okay, you say, maybe this is how it works. So what?

I've been very steadfast in claiming that narrative theory has many advantages, and is essential to our ability to parse the complexity of poker. But, of course, narrative theory has its drawbacks.

Inherent to its nature, narrative theory cannot be logically argued. There are some narrative disputes that can be resolved verbally, such as demonstrating two inconsistent memes were strung together, breaking the rules of narrativity. For example, there might be a narrative that includes both &ldquo;he couldn't've had a draw on the flop, because he loves to checkraise them&rdquo; and &ldquo;on the river he never bluffs big, so he had to have hit his draw.&rdquo; The rules of narrative theory disallow this combination, and others. Inconsistencies like this, however, are not terribly common once you reach a certain level of mastery over poker theory.

More often, when people are arguing about a poker narrative, it is not resolved by the narratives themselves. After all, narratives are incommensurate&mdash;they cannot be evaluated objectively, and each participant believes their own narrative (it should be no surprise that when we share hands, we always label ourselves the hero and our opponent the villain).When such disputes arise, they are often resolved by an appeal to authority&mdash;the players will go to a third party, another trusted poker player, to decide which narrative is best aligned with authority.

In fact, once you start seeing this phenomenon, you will start seeing it everywhere&mdash;especially in poker forums. What is a typical strategy thread, after all? An opening poster shows a hand, and then every subsequent poster takes a shot at communicating their own narrative of what's going on in the hand. This should seem like chaos, and yet usually when we read such a thread, we have an idea of which narrative &ldquo;won.&rdquo; How do we decide that?

There are three ways. First, if there is no consensus, we tend to ally ourselves with the narrative that most closely resembles our own. Second, if there is a consensus, then we choose the narrative that is most popular with the best players (which is a sign of fitness). This is often the way that narrative theory works. We observe a narrative somewhere in the wild, and from the fact that it's alive and well&mdash;by the evolutionary principle&mdash;we assume it must be strategically fit.

This is the basis of what I call **ecological learning.** There are three fundamental modes of learning in poker: learning through theory, learning via experience, and learning through observing others&mdash;ecological learning. Through this type of learning, you learn from &ldquo;what's out there&rdquo; or &ldquo;what people are doing&rdquo; (under the presumption that weak strategies would be culled out from the population). Thus, through ecological learning, popularity is an effective measure of a theory's fitness. Going back to the forum thread&mdash;the third possibility is that a poker authority weighs in to choose among these narratives, or possibly offer his own (which, if he does, we take as an even stronger sign of fitness). Let's say, for example, that Sauce or Jungleman weighs in. If they say something like &ldquo;this is a definite fold,&rdquo; this doesn't really qualify as narrative theory, it's simply a stand-in for a statement like this: &ldquo;this is a fold, and I've done (either explicitly or intuitively) the data analysis that tells me on average, folding is better than calling/raising.&rdquo; But if they offer their own explanation of the hand, then their narrative inevitably becomes the dominant one that later posters accept.

Rarely are these things decided by application of discrete theory, comparing mathematical models of the hands and assumptions and so on. Really, once you look at it this way, the art of poker argument can seem almost simplistic.

As a student of poker, if you were anything like I was, you will get into many arguments about poker. When you find something you disagree with, or which doesn't seem to make sense to you, it is good to challenge it. Debating poker theory will nourish your mind. But, especially as a developing player, you should be wary of arguments that begin and end in narrative theory.

At its core, all of narrative theory carries with it an implied warranty. The warranty is: &ldquo;somewhere out there, someone did some discrete theory to prove this works.&rdquo; Usually, this warranty goes unquestioned. But if you are engaged in a debate about poker, it is time for you to call this out. When someone makes a narrative claim that you deeply disagree with&mdash;challenge them to prove it. Don't accept it at their word! Or, if you have good reason to trust their authority, then take the time to prove it to yourself. As much as I've been stressing narrative theory as essential to our development, the ability to do discrete theory is important as well. Especially now, as poker evolves and games get more and more rigorous, the precision in strategy that can be captured by narrative theory is often not enough.

To reach the highest levels, you must gain a mastery of both discrete and narrative theory. And the only way to do that is to practice them. Learn how to run simulations. Learn how to use PokerEV, or StoxEV. If you don't know how to run basic programs like PokerStove, or how to do fold equity calculations, or how to calculate a GTO river strategy&mdash;learn them. Knowledge of discrete theory only bolsters your narrative theory, and helps you to know which structures in your poker game are sound, and which are more suspect.

Discrete analysis is the bedrock of theory, always. In the end, narrative theory is merely a stand-in, and so you must be willing to not only call others out when their stories don't add up, but also to scrutinize the concepts you employ in your own game. Narrative theory is merely the roadmap we sketch atop the true terrain of discrete theory.

But there are some situations which, no matter how hard we try, are insuperably complex, and cannot be broken down by discrete theory. PLO has many such situations. When you have a pair and a mediocre draw on a flop, is it better to lead out, or check/call? Is it better to flat it in a 3-bet pot, or raise the flop? What if stacks are deep? All of these variables will certainly affect the answer&mdash;but we don't know *how*. We have no idea where any of the cut-offs are for these variables, because PLO is such a combinatorially complex game, which makes mapping out a decision tree effectively impossible.

I remember once getting into a very tricky PLO flop situation. I couldn't figure out how to analyze the hand, so I took it to a number of world-class PLO players I knew. To my surprise, I kept getting different answers from anyone on the best way to play it&mdash;on the flop, one of the earliest streets, it baffled me that there could be so much disagreement! I was frustrated, but also fascinated. In reality, nobody who I took the hand to could actually break down the hand either&mdash;mathematically, it would be overwhelmingly complex to even try. The only way to defend a particular way of playing the hand was narratively. Essentially, I realized I was being told two different stories&mdash;and the only way I could decide between them was to pick one and go with it.Even with all its complications and imperfections, we need narrative theory. Although it can seem hopelessly convoluted at times, we have no alternative but to engage in the circus of narrativity, debate, and reason-giving. You must embrace the way that poker works. Only then can you navigate the world as it is, and develop your skills as a poker player.

You could say that, in a sense, it's incidental that math can model poker. After all, you can mathematically model the physics behind tennis, but physics has little to do with the process of learning tennis. I suspect that the same is largely true of poker. Most of the learning that we do in poker has little to do with the chess match. What we are playing is something vague and large, it is played in large strokes of thoughts, it is not transmitted through equations and proofs, but through stories and emulation. If poker couldn't be modeled by mathematics, then storytelling would be all we'd have to make sense of the game. Perhaps that's closer to reality than we think.

In the end, poker theory tells us about a lot more than just poker. It tells us about ourselves, the way our minds work, and the way that we interact with other members of our community. In the next article, we are going to look at this latter phenomenon, with an eye toward the practical. What kind of relationship should we have with the poker community? Poker is an intensely isolating and isolated profession, and yet, we would be helpless without a community of peers to guide our learning in the right direction. In the next article, I will discuss the poker community, and how to successfully develop and foster a poker network, and how to stay sane in a less-than-sane culture.

title: Ten Rules for Negotiating a Job Offer
tags: [tech careers]
image: negotiate.jpg
---

When [the story of how I landed a job at Airbnb](https://haseebq.com/farewell-app-academy-hello-airbnb-part-i/) went viral, I was surprised at how infatuated people were with my negotiations. Media stories portrayed me as some kind of master negotiator&mdash;a wily ex-poker-player who was able to con the tech giants into a lucrative job offer.

This is silly. It's silly for a lot of reasons, but one of the main ones is that in reality, my negotiation skills are nothing special. There are lots of job candidates who are better negotiators than I, to speak nothing of recruiters and other professional negotiators.

It just so happens that most people don't negotiate at all, or if they do, they just negotiate just enough to satisfy themselves that they did.

Worse yet, most of the advice out there on negotiation is borderline useless. Almost anything you read on the subject will be a vague and long-winded exhortation to &ldquo;make sure you negotiate&rdquo; and &ldquo;never say the first number.&rdquo; Beyond those two morsels of advice, you're pretty much on your own.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v1xrgXHfrFo/">[video]</div>

I thought to myself: why is there so little actionable advice out there about negotiation? I suspect it's because deep down, many people believe that negotiation is inexplicable, that it's something some people can do and others can't, and that there's no real way to break it down so anyone can learn it.

I say that's bullshit. Negotiation is a skill that can be learned just like any other, and I don't believe it's particularly elusive or hard to understand. So I'm going to try to explain how anyone can do it.

Three caveats.

First: I'm not an expert. There are people who really are experts at this, and when my advice contradicts theirs, you should assume I'm wrong.

Second: negotiation is tricky to generalize about because it's deeply intertwined with social dynamics and power. The appropriate advice for an Asian male in Silicon Valley may not be appropriate for a black woman in Birmingham, Alabama. Racial, sexual, and political dynamics accompany you to the negotiating table.

At the same time, I want to caution against overemphasizing these factors. Being afraid to negotiate out of fear of discrimination can often be just as deleterious as discrimination itself.

Ceteris paribus, negotiate aggressively.

Third: I'm the first to admit that negotiation is stupid. It's a practice that inherently benefits those who are good at it, and is an absurd axis on which to reward people. But it's a reality of our economic system. And like most collective action problems, we're probably not going to be able to abolish it any time soon. In which case, you might as well improve at it.

So here's my guide to negotiation. It's going to be split into two parts: this first part will be about conceptualizing the negotiating process, about how to begin the process and set yourself up for maximal success. The second part will be advice on the actual back-and-forth portion of negotiating and how to ask for what you want.

Let's take it from the top.

## What it means to &ldquo;get a job&rdquo;

In our culture we call entering the employment market &ldquo;trying to get a job.&rdquo; This is an unfortunate turn of phrase. &ldquo;Getting a job&rdquo; implies that jobs are a resource out in the world, and you're attempting to secure one of these resources. But that's completely backwards. What you are actually doing is selling your labor, and a company is bidding for it.

**Employment is just striking a mutual deal in the labor market.**

Like any market, the labor market only functions well if it's competitive. This is the only way to ensure fair and equitable pricing. Imagine you were a farmer selling watermelons. Would you just sell your watermelons to the first buyer who agreed to purchase them? Or would you survey the marketplace of buyers, see the best price (and business partner) you could get, and then make an informed decision on which buyer to sell to?

And yet, when people talk about the labor market, they think &ldquo;oh, a company wants to *give me a job*! What a relief!&rdquo; As though having a job were in itself some special privilege for which a company is the gatekeeper.

Dispel yourself of this mindset.

A job is just a deal. It is a deal between you and a company to exchange labor for money (and other things you value).

This might sound like an abstract point, but you should absolutely approach negotiation from this perspective.

## The role of negotiation

Negotiating is a natural and expected part of the process of trying to make a deal. It's also a signal of competence and seriousness. Companies generally respect candidates who negotiate, and most highly attractive candidates negotiate (if for no other reason, because they often have too many options to choose from).

At the risk of spouting truisms: always, always negotiate. Doesn't matter how good or bad you think you are. You never damage a relationship by negotiating.

In all my time as an instructor at App Academy, out of hundreds of offers negotiated, only once or twice were offers ever rescinded in negotiations. It basically never happens. And when it does, usually the candidate was being an unconscionable asshole, or the company was imploding and needed an excuse to rescind the offer.

You might think to yourself: &ldquo;*well, I don't want to set high expectations, and the offer is already generous, so I ought to just take it.*&ldquo;

**No. Negotiate.**

Or maybe: &ldquo;*I don't want to start off on the wrong foot and look greedy with my future employer.*&ldquo;

**No. Negotiate.**

&ldquo;*But this company is small and&mdash;*&ldquo;

**No. Shut up. Negotiate.**

We'll talk more in the next section about why a lot of these objections are bullshit, and fundamentally misapprehend the dynamics of hiring. But for now, just trust me that you should always negotiate.

## The ten rules of negotiating

I've tried to boil down negotiation to ten rules. The rules, in order of appearance, are:

1. Get everything in writing
2. Always keep the door open
3. Information is power
4. Always be positive
5. Don't be the decision maker
6. Have alternatives
7. Proclaim reasons for everything
8. Be motivated by more than just money
9. Understand what they value
10. Be winnable

We'll only get through some of these in this blog post, and the rest will appear in the second part. But I'll explain each rule as we get to it.

So let's start from the top and try to walk through a negotiation process from the very beginning. For most, that starts when you receive an offer.

## The offer conversation

You've just received the phone call: your interview went well, and after much deliberation they decided they like you. They want to make you an offer. Congratulations!

Don't get too excited though. The fun is just getting started.

Thank your recruiter. Sound excited&mdash;hopefully this won't be hard. Before jumping into details, try to ask for specific feedback on your interview performance. If they give it to you, this will help you gauge how much they want you, as well as tell you things you can improve on in your next interview(s).

Now time to explore the offer.

**Rule #1 of negotiating: have everything in writing.**

Eventually, they'll give you information about the offer. Write it all down. Doesn't matter if they're going to send you a written version later, **write everything down**. Even if there are things that are not directly monetary, if they relate to the job, write them down. If they tell you &ldquo;we're working on porting the front-end to Angular,&rdquo; write that down. If they say they have 20 employees, write that down. You want as much information as you can. You'll forget a lot of this stuff, and it's going to be important in informing your final decision.

Depending on the company, they'll also tell you about the equity package. We'll look more specifically at equity in part II, but be sure to write everything down.

The rule from here on out is that everything significant you discuss will have some kind of a paper trail. Often, the company won't even send you an official offer letter until a deal is finalized. So it falls to you to confirm all of the important details in subsequent e-mails.

So yadda yadda, lots of details, writing stuff down, oh there's a joke, time to laugh. Now the recruiter is done talking and you're done asking all of your questions.

Your recruiter will now say something along the lines of &ldquo;*so what do you think?*&ldquo;

This seems innocuous, but your reply here is critical, because there's a lot you can say to weaken your position. This is your first decision point.

A decision point is a moment in the negotiation where your interlocutor wants to compel you to make a decision. If they succeed in tying you to a position, they will close the door on further negotiating. Of course &ldquo;what do you think?&rdquo; is a subtle prod. But it is the beginning of many attempts to get you to make a premature commitment.

**This leads to rule #2 of negotiating: always keep the door open.** Never give up your negotiating power until you're absolutely ready to make an informed, deliberate final decision.

This means your job is to traverse as many of these decision points as possible without giving up the power to continue negotiating. Very frequently, your interlocutor will try to trick you into making a decision, or tie you to a decision you didn't commit to. You must keep verbally jiu-jitsu-ing out of these antics until you're actually ready to make your final decision.

## Protecting information

There's an uncomfortable silence by now, and their &ldquo;*what do you think?*&rdquo; is hanging in the air.

If you say &ldquo;*yes, that sounds amazing, when do I start?*&rdquo; you implicitly accept the offer and completely close the door on the negotiation. This is your recruiter's number one favorite thing to hear. It stands to reason you probably shouldn't do this.

But their second favorite thing to hear you say is &ldquo;*can you do 90K instead of 85K?*&rdquo; This also closes the door, but for a different and more subtle reason. And it's the number one reason why most people suck at negotiation.

**Rule #3 of negotiating: information is power.** To protect your power in the negotiation, you must protect information as much as possible.

A company doesn't give you insight into what it's thinking. It doesn't tell you its price range, how much it paid the previous candidate with your experience, or anything like that. It intentionally obfuscates those things. But it wants you not to do the same.

A company wants to be like a bidder in a secret auction. But unlike the other bidders, it wants to know exactly how high all of the other bids are. It then openly intends to exploit that knowledge, often by bidding one cent more than the second highest bid.

Yeah, no. Screw that. It's a silent auction, and to keep it that way, you must protect information.

In many situations, the only reason why you have any negotiating power at all is because the employer doesn't actually know what you're thinking. They might not know how good your other offers are, or how much you were making in your last job, or how you weigh salary vs equity, or even how rational you are as a decision-maker. Bottom line, you want them to be uncertain on exactly what it would take to sign you.

When you say &ldquo;*can you do 90K instead of 85K,*&rdquo; you've told them exactly what it will take to make you sign. The sheet's pulled back, the secret auction is up, and they're going to bid 90K (or more likely, 87K). And they know there's almost no risk in doing so, because you'll probably accept.

What if you were the kind of person who wouldn't even consider an offer below 110K? Or the kind of person who wouldn't consider an offer below 120K? If you were, you wouldn't ask for 90K, and if they offered it as conciliation, you'd tell them to stop wasting your time.

By staying silent, *they don't actually know which of those kinds of people you are.* In their mind, you could be any of the three.

A corollary of this rule is that you should not reveal to companies what you're currently making. There are some exceptions, but as a rule you should assume this. If you must divulge what you're making, you should be liberal in noting the total value of your package (incorporate bonuses, unvested stock, nearness to promotion etc.), and always mention it in a context like &ldquo;*[XYZ] is what I'm currently making, and I'm definitely looking for a step up in my career for my next role.*&ldquo;

Companies will ask about your current compensation at different stages in the process&mdash;some before they ever interview you, some after they decide to make you an offer. But be mindful of this, and protect information.

So given this offer, don't ask for more money or equity or anything of the sort. Don't comment on any specific details of the offer except to clarify them.

Give away nothing. Retain your power.

Say instead: &ldquo;*Yeah, [COMPANY_NAME] sounds great! I really thought this was a good fit, and I'm glad that you guys agree. Right now I'm talking with a few other companies so I can't speak to the specific details of the offer until I'm done with the process and get closer to making a decision. But I'm sure we'll be able to find a package that we're both happy with, because I really would love to be a part of the team.*&ldquo;

Think like the watermelon farmer. This offer is just is the first businessman who's stopped by your watermelon patch, glanced over your crops, and announced &ldquo;I'll take all of these right now for $2 a melon.&rdquo;

Cool. It's a big market, and you're patient&mdash;you're a farmer after all. Just smile and tell them you'll keep their offer in mind.

And this is super important: always be unequivocally positive.

## The importance of positivity

**Staying positive is rule #4 of negotiation**. Even if the offer is shit, it's extremely important to remain positive and excited about the company. This is because *your excitement is one of your most valuable assets in a negotiation.*

A company is making you an offer because they think you'll do hard work for them if they pay you. If you lose your excitement for the company during the interview process, then they'll lose confidence that you'll actually want to work hard or stay there for a long time. Each of those makes you less attractive as an investment. Remember, you are the product! If you become less excited, then the product you're selling actually loses value.

Imagine you were negotiating with someone over buying your watermelons, but the negotiation took so long that by the time you'd reached an agreement, your watermelons had gone bad.

Companies are terrified of that. They don't want their candidates to go bad during a negotiation. Hence why they hire professional recruiters to manage the process and make sure they remain amicable. You and the recruiter share the same interest in that regard. If a company feels like you've gone bad, suddenly they're a lot less willing to pay for you.

So despite whatever is happening in the negotiation, give the company the impression that 1) you still like the company, and that 2) you're still excited to work there, even if the numbers or the money or the timing is not working out. Generally the most convincing thing to signal this is to reiterate you love the mission, the team, or the problem they're working on, and really want to see things work out.

## Don't be the decision-maker

You can wrap up the conversation now by saying:

> I'll look over some of these details and discuss it with my [FAMILY/CLOSE\\\\_FRIENDS/SIGNIFICANT\\\\_OTHER]. I'll reach out to you if I have any questions. Thanks so much for sharing the good news with me, and I'll be in touch!

So not only are you ending the conversation with the power all in your hands, but note there's another important move here: you're roping in other decision-makers.

**Rule #5 of negotiation: don't be the decision-maker.** Even if you don't particularly care what your friends/family/husband/mother thinks, by mentioning them, you're no longer the only person the recruiter needs to win over. There's no point in them trying to bully and intimidate you; the &ldquo;true decision-maker&rdquo; is beyond their reach.

This is a classic technique in customer support and remediation. It's never the person on the phone's fault, they're just some poor schmuck doing their job. It's not their decision to make. This helps to defuse tension and give them more control of the situation.

It's much harder to pressure someone if they're not the final decision-maker. So take advantage of that.

Okay!

We have our first offer. Send a follow-up e-mail confirming all of the details you discussed with your recruiter so you have a paper trail. Just say &ldquo;*just wanted to confirm I had all the details right.*&ldquo;

Groovy. Next step is to leverage this to land other offers and find the best deal we can find in the job market.

## Getting other offers

Turns out, it doesn't matter that much where your first offer is from, or even how much they're offering you. Just having an offer in hand will get the engine running.

If you're already in the pipeline with other companies (which you should be if you're doing it right), you should proactively reach out and let them know that you've just received an offer. Try to build a sense of urgency. Regardless of whether you know the expiration date, all offers expire at some point, so take advantage of that.

> Hello [PERSON],
>
> I just wanted to update you on my own process. I've just received an offer from [COMPANY] which is quite strong. That said, I'm really excited about [YOUR AMAZING COMPANY] and really want to see if we can make it work. Since my timeline is now compressed, is there anything you can do to expedite the process?

Should you specifically mention the company that gave you an offer? Depends. If it's a well-known company or a competitor, then definitely mention it. If it's a no-name or unsexy company, you should just say you received an offer. If it's expiring soon, you should mention that as well.

Either way, send out a letter like this to every single company you're talking to. No matter how hopeless or pointless you think your application is, you want to send this signal to everyone who is considering you in the market.

Second, if there are any other companies you are looking to apply to (whether through referral or cold application), or even companies at which you've already applied but haven't heard back, I would also follow up with a similar e-mail.

So why do this? Isn't this tacky, annoying, or even desperate?

None of the above. It is the oldest method in history to galvanize a marketplace&mdash;show that supplies are limited and build urgency. Demand breeds demand. Not every company will respond to this, but many will.

Isn't it stupid that companies respond to this though?

## Why companies care about other offers

[When I wrote about the story of my own job search](https://haseebq.com/farewell-app-academy-hello-airbnb-part-i/), I mentioned how having an offer from Google made companies turn around and expedite me through their funnels. Many commentators lamented at the capriciousness of these companies. If Uber or Twitch only talked to me because of Google and until then weren't willing to look at me, what did that say about their hiring processes? What legitimately are they evaluating, if anything at all?

I think this response is totally backwards. The behavior of tech companies here is actually very rational, and you would do well to understand it.

First, you must realize what a company's goal is. A company's goal is to hire someone who will become an effective employee and produce more value than their cost. How do you figure out who will do that? Well, you can't know for certain without actually hiring them, but there are a few proxies. Pedigree is the strongest signal; if they did it at other companies, they can probably do it at yours. And if someone trusted within the organization can vouch for them, that's often a strong signal as well.

But turns out, almost everything else is a weak signal. Weak in the sense that it's just not very reliable. Interviews, if you think about it, are long, sweaty, uncomfortable affairs that only glancingly resemble actual employment. They're weird and can't tell you that much about whether an individual will be a good at their job. There's no way around this. There are a few stronger signals, like bringing someone in for a week or two on a contract-to-hire position, but strong candidates won't consider this. So candidates as a whole have effectively forced companies to assume almost all of the risk in hiring.

The truth is, knowing that someone has passed your interview just doesn't say *that much* about whether they'll be a good employee. It's as though you knew nothing about a student other than their SAT score. It's just not a lot of data to go off.

Nobody has solved this problem. Not Google nor anyone else.

And this is precisely why it's rational for companies to care that you've received other offers. They care because each company knows that their own process is noisy, and the processes of most other companies are also noisy. But a candidate having multiple offers means that they have multiple weak signals in their favor. Combined, these converge into a much stronger signal than any single interview. It's like knowing that a student has a strong SAT score, and GPA, and won various scholarships. Sure, it's still possible that they're a dunce, but it's much harder for that to be true.

This is not to say that companies respond proportionally to these signals, or that they don't overvalue credentials and brands. They do. But caring about whether you have other offers and valuing you accordingly is completely rational.

So this is all to say&mdash;tell other companies that you've received offers. Give them more signal so that they know you're a valued and compelling candidate. And understand why this changes their mind about whether to interview you.

As you continue interviewing, remember to keep practicing your interview skills. The single strongest determinant of your final offer will be the number and strength of offers that you receive.

## Some advice on timing

You want to be strategic about the timing of your offers. Generally, you should try to start interviewing at larger companies earlier. Their processes are slower and their offer windows are wider (meaning they allow you more time to decide). Startups are the other way around.

Your goal should be to have as many offers overlapping at the same time as possible. This will maximize your window for negotiating.

When you receive an offer, often the first thing you should ask for is more time to make your decision. Especially in your first offer, more time is by far the most valuable thing you can ask for. It's time that enables you to activate other companies and end up with the strongest possible offer. So be prepared to fight for time.

## How to approach exploding offers

Hoo boy.

Exploding offers are offers that expire within 24-72 hours. You won't see this much at big companies, but they're becoming increasingly common among startups and mid-sized companies.

Exploding offers suck, and I share most people's disdain for this practice. But I do understand it. Exploding offers are a natural weapon for employers to combat a strong hiring market for tech workers. Companies know exactly what they're doing with exploding offers&mdash;they play on fear and limit your ability to seek out counteroffers.

In a sense, it's unsurprising that if startups have more difficulty attracting and securing talent, they'd resort to this practice. What I don't like is the dishonesty about it. Employers often justify this by saying &ldquo;*If you need more time than this, then that's a sign you're not the kind of person we're looking for.*&ldquo;

Please don't buy this crap or feel guilty over it. They're simply doing this to improve their chance of closing candidates. Needing more than three days to make a life decision isn't a sign of anything other than thoughtfulness.

So what should you do if you receive an exploding offer?

Exploding offers are anathema to your ability to effectively navigate the labor market. Thus, there is only one thing to do. Treat the offer as a non-offer unless the expiration window is widened.

In no uncertain terms, convey that if the offer is exploding, it's useless to you.

Example conversation:

> I have one big concern. You mentioned that this offer explodes in 48 hours. I'm afraid this doesn't work at all for me. There's no way that I can make a decision on this offer within a 48 hour window. I'm currently wrapping up my interview process at a few other companies, which is likely to take me another week or so. So I'm going to need more time to make an informed decision.

If they push back and say this is the best they can do, then politely reply:

> That's really unfortunate. I like [YOUR COMPANY] and was really excited about the team, but like I said, there's no way I can consider this offer. 48 hours just too unreasonable of a window. The next company I join will be a big life decision for me, and I take my commitments very seriously. I also need to consult with my [EXTERNAL\\\\_DECISION\\\\_MAKER]. There's no way that I can make a decision I'm comfortable with in this short an amount of time.

Pretty much any company will relent at this point. If they persist, don't be afraid to walk away over it. (They probably won't let that happen, and will come grab you as you're walking out the door. But if they don't, then honestly, screw 'em.)

I was given several exploding offers during my job search. And every time, I did essentially this. Every single offer immediately widened to become more reasonable, sometimes by several weeks.

I want to emphasize, lest I be misunderstood here&mdash;what I'm saying is not to just silently let an exploding offer expire, and assume that everything will be fine and they'll still hire you. They won't. For exploding offers to be a credible weapon, a company has to have a reputation of enforcing them. I'm saying explicitly call this out as an issue when they make the offer.

Don't let a company bully you into giving away your negotiating power.

## The Negotiating Mindset

Before we enter into the actual back-and-forth, I want to examine the mindset you should have as a negotiator. This applies not just to how you approach the conversation, but also to how you think about the company.

Do not fall into the trap of valuing companies solely along one dimension. That means don't just value companies based on salary, equity, or even on prestige. Those are all important dimensions, but so are cultural fit, the challenge of the work, learning potential, later career options, quality of life, growth potential, and just overall happiness. None of these inherently trump any of the other. Anyone who tells you &ldquo;just choose wherever you think you'll be happiest&rdquo; is being just as simplistic than someone who says &ldquo;just choose the one that offers the most money.&rdquo; All of these things matter, and your decision should be genuinely multi-dimensional.

Be open to being surprised as you explore different companies.

It's also important to understand that companies don't all value you along the same dimension either. That is, different companies are genuinely looking for different skills, and there are some companies at which you will be more and less valuable. Even at peer companies this is true, especially so if you have a specialized skill-set.

The more companies you talk to, the more likely you are to find a company to which you are significantly more valuable than the rest. Chances are this is where you'll be able to negotiate your strongest offer. It might surprise you which company this turns out to be; keep an open mind, and remember that a job search is a 2-sided process.

One of the most valuable things you can do for yourself in this process is to really try to understand how employers think and what motivates them. Understanding your interlocutor is extremely important in negotiation, and we'll be exploring that a lot in the next blog post.

But most of all I want to emphasize: be curious about the other side. Try to understand why employers think the way they do. Be sympathetic toward them. Care about what they want and help them try to get it. Adopting this mindset will make you a much stronger negotiator, and accordingly, a much better employee and team member.

Okay. That's as far as we're going for today. In the next blog post, I'm going to cover the last four rules of negotiation. I'll also go over the actual back-and-forth process&mdash;how to ask for what you want, how to strengthen offers, and how to dismantle the tricks that companies will try to pull on you. Also a lot more on the theory of negotiation, which I really dig.
