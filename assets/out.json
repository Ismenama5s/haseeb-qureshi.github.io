Hey guys,

There's so much I could write, but I'm not ready to write it yet. I have spent quite some time now in Croatia. It's a fucking beautiful country. This entry will purely be photographs of the beautiful Croatia. Along with a badass song for accompaniment.

Tomorrow I plan to head back down to the coast and then take a ferry to Italy, and then travel up through the Italian countryside. I will write more soon, but I wanted to share these photos because there's so much amazing stuff I've seen in this country. It's definitely been one of my favorites. More soon.

Back on the road,

I have just left Venice. It is, without a doubt, the most beautiful city I've been to. It is also my least favorite city I've been to. Venice exhausts me. I originally planned to stay longer, but I couldn't stand it.

![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Tpj7RDmH0OE/Tnn_MisB8qI/AAAAAAAAAog/jBT83FMaRWY/s400/IMG_2892.JPG)

In the day, Venice is overcrowded with tourists. At any given time, more than 60% of the people in Venice are tourists, and almost all of the rest of the population work in the tourism industry. No matter where you go, the streets are flooded with tourists, windowshopping for refrigerator magnets and coffee mugs as trophies of their travels, eating at overpriced and under-portioned Italian restaurants. I want to say that they are trespassing, but the reality is that there is nothing really to trespass on. One could say that Venice doesn't belong to anyone anymore; it has no life of its own. It exists only as an image, and everybody who lives in Venice works on the upkeep of this image. Well, the truth is, as much as I want to say that Venice doesn't belong to anyone, it's probably truer to say that Venice now belongs to the tourists. It breathes only for them, and so they are right to treat it as they do.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vyut3GyQtn0">[video]</div>

![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xjx_k8i0WTQ/TnnKPYvJSHI/AAAAAAAAAnY/2ixEvJB0b7w/s1600/IMG_2940.JPG)

But the strangest experience is to wander Venice at night. Because Venice is powered purely by tourism, by about 10PM everything shuts down as the old people start retiring to their ripoff hotels. By midnight, even the most famous and enchanting streets are completely empty. For a moment then, Venice becomes yours. How strange. At the strike of midnight, to inherit an entire city. It is eerie and beautiful to imagine all of the midnight strolls through the history of this city must've looked just like this. Not a soul in sight. The duces, the priests, the kings and the slaves all saw the same Venice if they ventured out into the night. To me, it is at night then when Venice comes alive. When I can see clearest through the eyes of history.

![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HSxFxXexVRI/TnnH3gmjYuI/AAAAAAAAAmM/AOWfBicESzg/s1600/IMG_2777.JPG)

![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FjwXgE0wLEs/TnnH__DIRRI/AAAAAAAAAmk/_YYzenFMyYA/s1600/IMG_2857.JPG)

Nevertheless, I had to leave. The city drains me. Venice in the day is a facade, and there's only so much wandering at night one can do before the mosquitos start to get bothersome. I did however see the island of Burano, which is famous for its brightly colored houses. Visually it's beautiful, and less crowded than the mainland of Venice.

I have been thinking a lot lately about the purpose of this journey. Why am I traveling? Where do I think this path will take me?

When I was in Split, a friend of mine told me this. &ldquo;Haseeb, stop worrying so much about finding yourself or figuring stuff out. There's nothing to figure out, and nothing to find. Just have fun, party, meet people, and enjoy your time in Europe. Stop thinking so much. It doesn't help.&rdquo; I nodded at him, paying my respect to the advice he was giving me. But as he said it, I thought to myself that he is wrong. And that his advice may be right for someone else, but not for me. I am a thinker, a loner. There is much that I have yet to think about.

![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xB3KZk3Rafw/TnnKFDPse-I/AAAAAAAAAnE/zxTIpnUmpFw/s1600/IMG_2885.JPG)

But it has occurred to me that perhaps he is right. That in thinking and in isolation I will not learn who I am, but instead will learn the version of myself that I choose to see. But in doing, in relinquishing myself and my self-understanding to only what I do, what I accomplish, what I effect in the world, then I will truly know who I am. For some reason I have been avoiding this almost obvious conclusion. I am too comfortable in silence, too at peace in solitude, that I believe there must be some great and important piece of my puzzle somewhere in that darkness. That if I don't come to know that piece of me, that it'll always be incomplete. But the truth is, it wouldn't matter if I did got to know that piece. It changes constantly, and trying to grab hold of it in one moment is like trying to grasp an ocean in your hand.

There are only two things that I need to know. The first is who I want to be. And the second is who I am. I can only know who I want to be by meeting and interacting with enough people who I respect and who hold in themselves qualities that I would like to embody. And the only way to know who I am is to do enough, vitally and passionately enough, that I know through what I do who it is I am in the world. It is through my engagement in the world that who I am will be reflected back to me. The world is a mirror, and through one's actions, one's self is reflected back.

![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--pCFt6AYPN4/TnnH6RlYueI/AAAAAAAAAmU/Oh9Jr0f2SP8/s1600/IMG_2800.JPG)

Right now I can put this into words, but I don't know if I truly believe it yet. Perhaps that's just a matter of time. I am not half the man I like to think I am, but in some ways I am much more as well. There are times when I despise myself, and other times when I feel blessed to have the capabilities that I have. It wil probably always be that way. And in some way that piece of myself that is in the darkness will always be in the darkness, and when I'm twice my age I'll still struggle to understand it. That journey never ends.

I am in Padua now, and I like it a lot more than Venice. I will write more soon, about a guy I met a few weeks ago named Alex. I've been putting off writing about him and my interaction with him, but I shouldn't any longer. I will be here in Padua for about a week. I will try to meet people and immerse myself into the life here.

I've been procrastinating on writing this entry. At one point I started writing, but I found myself avoiding the very topic that I intended to write about. Actually, I could write a lot about the experiences I've had in Padua and Vicenze&mdash;about almost getting mugged when I came into Padua, about meeting a group of girls and joining their private graduation party, about a med student who tried to convince me to start a business developing new drugs by appending methyl groups to known hallucinogens, about learning how to ride a bike (yes, I couldn't ride a bike) in the middle of the night in the streets of Padua, about listening to chanting in the Basilica de Saint Antonio, about attending an outdoor jazz concert and hanging out with a group of wandering musicians, about befriending a group of Nigerians and going out to Vicenze to party with them, about learning that I only look like I can dance when I'm around white guys, about helping my Nigerian friend who put me up for a night run his kebab shop, and about how I flipped a coin on my last day in Vicenze and decided to turn around and head back east towards Slovenia. If I wanted to pussy out, there's plenty of interesting adventures I've been on that I could write about. But the fact is, again and again I shy away from writing about Alex. When I open up a blank page and say I'm going to write about him, nothing comes.

I need to write about Alex.

Alex is the first man I've met in a long time to whom I felt I had nothing to offer. The feeling came over me that he was not only a greater man than I, but possessed a greater soul than mine. I had for the first time in a long time met a man who I wanted to be like. And to this man, my complexity and my accomplishments were of no interest and made no impression. He at once at staggered, and fiercely intrigued me.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WR97Ne4ZuGc">[video]</div>

I first met Alex in Prague. The moment of our meeting was ordinary in most senses. But he made an impression on me from the very beginning. Alex had a great presence. That itself is not altogether a rarity among men. But it was not just in his size or his posture&mdash;he was a large and tall man, with slightly browned skin, chiseled European features and a faintly graying head of hair. Though he stood erect and took up space, as good posture should&mdash;he had an enclosed, almost subdued presence. Often he would have his hands in his pockets. But there was a feeling when you spoke and interacted with the man that he could command a room from where he stood. That the strongest hands in the room were the ones buried in his pockets. When he walked, he strolled. As though upon conquered land. His smile was gentle and frequent. His eyes were dark. He knew how to use his eyes.

When I first spoke to him, his confidence annoyed me. I think I have an unfortunate habit of seeing most other men's confidence as unearned until I learn otherwise. I remember asking him, &ldquo;So where are you from man?&rdquo;

He smiled at me. &ldquo;Where do you think I'm from?&rdquo;

&ldquo;I have no idea,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;Well, take a guess,&rdquo; he said.

I met his eyes, unimpressed. Someone else spoke up and asked &ldquo;Are you Israeli?&rdquo; He grinned, &ldquo;Oh, Israeli! I have many Israeli friends, they are fantastic people. I wish I were Israeli!&rdquo;

I watched him still. Someone else asked &ldquo;Are you African?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, African! The Africans are a wonderful race, I would be lucky to be African. But I'm afraid I am not.&rdquo;

&ldquo;So what are you?&rdquo; I asked.

He noticed my impatience, and smiled. &ldquo;I'm actually German.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Hm.&rdquo;

![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TElpE__vzrI/TouRPqT1r7I/AAAAAAAAApM/Z7joXOGUDC8/s1600/IMG_3224.JPG)

That was how I met Alex. It took me some time to get any straight answers out of him about himself. But the more I spoke to him, the more I felt the immensity of this man. His intelligence, the breadth of his experience, and his tremendous strength of character. When I first spoke to him, he scarcely told me anything about himself. When I would ask him personal questions, he would often answer &ldquo;oh, that's a long story. Too long for this night.&rdquo; Despite his guardedness, I could sense a tremendous humility from this man.

He asked me why I was traveling. What the purpose was of my journey. I started with a simple answer&mdash;&ldquo;well, it's a long story, but basically I walked away from my former career. And now I'm just traveling, trying to figure some shit out in my life.&rdquo; Alex didn't let me off that easily. He asked me, &ldquo;well, what is it you're looking for? And how are you going to know when you've found it?&rdquo;

I ended up telling Alex a lot about my life, my history, my fears and about the chaos in my mind. He listened. Truth be told, the first couple of hours that we spoke I basically poured out my heart and mind to this man. He accepted it, nodding, gazing at me, asking questions now and again.

![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Q6LI_uUx8kw/TouRXj1TvhI/AAAAAAAAApQ/D4En34brf1M/s1600/IMG_3228.JPG)

I could go all day about the conversation we had. But one subject that he spoke of that sticks with me is religion. He asked me if I was religious, and I told him that I wasn't. He inquired about my family and my upbringing&mdash;he knew a lot about Pakistani culture. He told me that he had spent a great deal of his life studying and exploring various religious traditions. &ldquo;I don't know what it is you're looking for or if this is an answer, but maybe you will find something in the culture that you left behind. I can't claim that this will solve your problems or make you whole, but if you're searching, then this is a good a place as any to start.&rdquo;

He told me he knew many people like me; cultural transplants who no longer believed in the religion of their ancestors. &ldquo;I don't know too much about this, but everybody I know who has gone here has returned different. When they came back, they found meaning in their lives. You say religion does not mean anything to you, but one thing I have learned in life is that religion can be an enormous source of strength.&rdquo;

He paused for a moment. &ldquo;Have you ever faced death?&rdquo;

![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jh1DHqCJXcE/TouRxs3icGI/AAAAAAAAApo/hTZRTx_zocA/s1600/IMG_3246.JPG)

I looked at him. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Well, if you ever face death&mdash;I mean, in those few minutes that you're convinced are going to be your last, you learn a lot about a man. And suddenly all of these philosophical armchair questions become so immediate, you can feel the question pulsing through your veins: what happens next? It becomes all you can think about, all that matters. For that moment that you know you're going to die, you really learn what you believe deep down. If you believe there is nothing, or if there is something more. From my time in the military, when I met men who faced the verge of death, you learn a lot about the power of religion. You learned also who are the true believers, and who in their last moments realized that their religion was all just an act. In those last moments, some become weak, and some become strong.&rdquo;

&ldquo;You should think about it.&rdquo; He pulled out a piece of paper and started scribbling on it. &ldquo;There is is a place in the north of Pakistan called the Raiwind. There you will find a group of Islamic missionaries who meet every year. If you go there and they will put you to work. And if you go there as you are now, you will hate it. You will get sick and you will suffer and you will want to go home and you will hate your life. But when you come back, you will be different. I'm not saying that this is right for you or that you'll find an answer here.&rdquo;

&ldquo;But think about it.&rdquo; He handed me a slip of paper with the name of the town written in Arabic. I took it. &ldquo;Can I ask you something?&rdquo; I said to him. He nodded. &ldquo;You say you've studied all of these religions – Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, atheism. But for your own part&hellip;what religion do you believe in now?&rdquo;

He smiled at me.

&ldquo;I wear my religion on my heart, not on my tongue.&rdquo;

![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nLrAeupvzUQ/TouRfvrBOrI/AAAAAAAAApc/ZXL8pOlczQg/s1600/IMG_3240.JPG)

![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-m3fqdf1BE8A/TouRvheghXI/AAAAAAAAApk/lNFetw3FrOw/s1600/IMG_3242.JPG)

It is very rare that I take it seriously when somebody suggests to me religion as the answer to my problems. I took Alex very seriously. I still have that piece of paper.

Alex lived a crazy life, as I came to learn. I don't want to go into too much detail&mdash;and the whole of his story is so fantastic that were I to recite what he told me, you'd think me crazy for believing it. Out of respect for him, I won't write everything he told me. But among the episodes in his life&mdash;he was born into a family of 9 children and worked in construction as a child since the age of 7. He joined the German military once he turned 18 where he received training equivalent to that of a Navy SEAL, traveled all through the middle East, experiencing such atrocities and depravity that he said changed his understanding of humanity forever. After his military service he returned to get his education (over his life he acquired several degrees), spent a year homeless so he could afford to stay in school and complete his education, worked as a bouncer in the ghettos of London, learned to speak numerous languages, traveled through the jungle by himself for several months, studied in a Buddhist monastery, and eventually worked prestigious jobs under several different governments. I can't go into too much detail as to what he does&mdash;partially because I don't fully understand it myself&mdash;but the adventures and experiences that this man has been through astound me still. He is only 35.

In comparison, I feel small; incomplete.

![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VuyeDhVnQQM/TouRHwgJDwI/AAAAAAAAApI/hobuLnQWTss/s1600/IMG_3216.JPG)

Alex showed me what it means to be a strong man. Not just in his physicality, but in the resolve of his character. He is self-contained, prepared for anything. If you dropped him onto any point on this planet he would be able to thrive. According to him: his ideal of a man was &ldquo;the Victorian gentleman.&rdquo; The Victorian gentleman was a lover, a fighter, a poet, a philosopher, a dancer, an adventurer, and an intellectual. He told me what drove him in his life and guided his evolution was his desire to become this sort of man he always idolized.

What to me does it mean to be a man? I told him&mdash;perhaps what I'm searching for is my own definition of manhood. To find all of my disparate parts and tie them all together. To marry myself to an ideal that I truly see as worth living towards. It occurs to me that I've never had an idol. An ideal. It's almost as though I don't know myself well enough to know who I want to be, or what my evolution would look like.

Alex always projected an openness. Like I could say anything to him. I want to be more like Alex in that way. I ask myself&mdash;what specific quality in him do I want to emulate? His humility. His invitingness. To be kind to all&mdash;no, that is not quite right. To be gentle to all. To be gentle. It occurs to me how apt the word &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo; is, and I wonder how this meaning eluded me for so long.

But what sticks with me most is Alex's sadness. He lived a very difficult and lonely life. And despite his tremendous charisma and command over both men and women, I could tell that he had a great sadness that he carried with him. That he shared with no one. I saw a small glimpse of it, perhaps because I know the species so well from what I carry with myself. But despite his strength, his fortitude, his knowledge, his charm&mdash;he had not found his happiness. And he told me he wasn't sure he ever would.

Alex's road will not lead me to happiness. But it will lead me to strength. But when I think about it, I realize is the only road that I can see. My choice is not between happiness and unhappiness, but between strength and weakness. There is no road that is before me that leads to happiness, no streetlights illuminate that path. So when it comes down to it, I must choose strength. I must take the road that strengthens me, and whatever else will be will be. To suffer, and to be at peace with suffering, for pain only makes one stronger. To value strength above all else – strength of body, of mind, of spirit&mdash;this is, to me, the path to being a man. This is what I want to take from Alex.

Before we parted ways, I took it upon myself to let him know that I had great respect for him. That I had never met anyone like him before, and that he was an amazing man. He was flattered, but I think not particularly impressed. In the end we were together for hours upon hours, and it wasn't until 6am the next morning that I last saw him as I accompanied him to the tram station in the center of Prague. I think he could tell that I wanted to stay in touch with him, that I was afraid I would never speak to him again. He offered me his e-mail address, and told me to write him whenever I felt like it.

I wrote him a rather long-email a few weeks ago. He never replied. That's okay, I don't expect him to (and perhaps wouldn't myself if the situations were reversed). My task and challenge now is to learn the lesson that he had to teach me. To not let our meeting be lost on me.

![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5BSZy9hX-I8/TouR-NfjasI/AAAAAAAAAp0/HiCOADu_MYM/s1600/IMG_3261.JPG)

I musn't let myself forget. I still remember his voice. His confident, yet careful tone. His large, dark eyes. His hands.

(Edit: Just wanted to clarify, I am not considering going to the Raiwind to become an Islamic missionary. But I respect Alex for making the suggestion to me, and understand where it came from. However I am now possibly considering traveling to Pakistan at the end of my journey. I have not been there in several years and have never faced it as an adult. There may be something for me to learn there. Were it not for Alex, I don't think I would have considered it.)

Yesterday morning I just left Ljubljana, where I was living for over a week. It has probably been my favorite city thus far. The people there are so friendly, the food is so great, the pace of life is just so relaxed and wonderful&hellip;There's so much I could say about this place. But for once I'll let the photos do the talking.

The hostel I was staying in, Hostel Celica, is a landmark of Metelkova. Metelkova used to be a military barracks during the war, and Celica was its prison. It has since been renovated by Slovenian artists, every cell containing a different design. This is the cell I slept in for several nights.

![](Slovenia?authuser=0&feat=directlink)

But yesterday morning I left Ljubljana. Today I just arrived in a town called Albi in the south of France. From there, my two hosts picked me up and drove me out to a little house in the countryside. In exchange for a room and three meals a day, I will be working on their farm for the next three weeks.

This is something I've been thinking about for a while, but a couple of weeks ago I decided to give it a try. I've never worked a real job before&mdash;I've been playing poker professionally since I was 16&mdash;and I've never lived out in the country. The nearest village is 10 kilometers away; the farm itself is over 50 acres. Over the next few weeks I imagine I will have a lot of time to reflect, to sweat, to write, and hopefully to brush up on some French while I'm at it.

It is quiet here.

I will write more&mdash;probably a lot more&mdash;about it next time. For now, I need to sleep&hellip;breakfast is at 8AM tomorrow morning. Grumble.

I used to have a running joke with my students. Whenever I would checkraise a flop against an opponent they would ask me, &ldquo;Hey Dog, why are you checkraising here?&rdquo; And I would always answer, &ldquo;because fuck him, that's why.&rdquo; Halfhearted chuckles all around, and then I would explain the logic behind my checkraise. Well today somebody asked me why in the hell I'm working on a farm in Europe. I thought about all of the little things that I could say – that it would give me time to reflect, teach me about the value of hard work or the quiet of nature, and so on. But that's all bullshit anyway. Why am I doing this? I answered him, &ldquo;because fuck me, that's why.&rdquo;

This is my fourth night sleeping on the farm.

![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JG9KNyhE1aQ/TpZ4WLEG-hI/AAAAAAAAAw0/A9LLy5Y1-oI/s1600/IMG_3669.JPG)

I've been working from 8:30 AM til 2PM. The first couple of days we have been repairing a damaged barn and bricklaying. Today we started clearing a forest near the back of the farm. I don't think I've done manual labor on this level before in my life. My back, shoulders, and arms all ache.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PSMNJuXK_3I">[video]</div>

It feels right. I need this. Somehow I know I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.

My hosts are interesting characters. A Swiss-English couple. The woman, Wendy, is 68, and the man, Peter, is 39. They used to run a horseriding school in Switzerland together, but now they and their horses have retired to this farm in the south of France. Interestingly, they became a couple when Peter was 21. that means at the time, she was 50. They are, to say the least, a curious couple. But they're lovely and have been very good to me. I am learning a lot everyday. But unlike me, my hosts go to sleep very early and wake up around 6am. So I've been trying to go to sleep earlier than I usually do, but in the last couple months I've been used to sleeping around 3AM or even later.

![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Zr_fXPymlWs/TpZ6W4rZ8JI/AAAAAAAAAxc/nFJMjD6BWxM/s1600/IMG_3724.JPG)

Every night before bed, I take a walk. As I walk down the country road, I start thinking to myself. It reminds me of the walks I used to take back home. But here, there are no streetlights, only the light of the moon. There is nothing around, and it is too dark to make out anything in the distance but the rolling hills. It's quiet, and I realize that I am alone.

For a moment, I try to place myself. Try to tell myself that I am walking down a country road outside a farm in the south of France. That I am Haseeb Qureshi, that I was born in Texas and that I am on a journey to find myself. But none of that sticks. It rolls off my mind, like water. All I can do is wonder. Wonder what it's like to grow up on a farm. Wonder if this would all be ordinary and unspectacular to me if I had grown up in the country. Wonder if the moon always shines like that, or if I just noticed it especially tonight – it's really the light of the sun, just reflecting off the moon. The moon doesn't have its own light really, that's just my mythologizing mind. Wonder if I could jump that fence into the neighboring farm's field. They say she's never around anyway. Wonder if the book I write is going to be worth anything. Wonder how people will remember me when I die.

Wonder why I am so desperate to mean something.

And then I think: it's late, I should head home. Because breakfast is at 8, and I suck at waking up in the mornings.

It is now my last night here. I have been volunteering on this farm in the south of France for a little over two weeks, but tonight I had to say goodbye to a landscape that is now so familiar to me.

Since I got here, once every night I take a long walk along the winding road leading to the farm. There are no streetlights. You can usually see the stars, and tonight they were brighter than I've seen them before&mdash;the sky is always clearer in the country. And every night as I walk, thoughts, images, memories promenade through my mind, and occasionally one arrests me for being more poignant than all the rest. The one that caught me on my final night here was a simple question. &ldquo;What did I come here to expecting to learn? And what did I learn instead?&rdquo;

![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8T8JnbM1USk/Tqxl91raZeI/AAAAAAAAA6Q/49reE0wFtQw/s1600/IMG_3788.JPG)

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Y692d0GPQw">[video]</div>

I'm not sure entirely what brought me to this farm. I think maybe deep down I viewed it as something of an idyllic acquaintance with nature. Perhaps it was the momentarily attractive idea of doing gruntwork and breaking myself in. Or perhaps I was just tired of bouncing around from country to country, from culture to culture, and wanted to let my soul have a moment to itself. And maybe, somewhere deep down in some embarrassing corner of my mind, perhaps I suspected that I'd fall in love with country life and would decide to live the rest of my life as a hermit at the foot of some mountain.

![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L0HhNouh1CE/TqxlrOlNrAI/AAAAAAAAA5E/nCY6xqlxsTQ/s1600/IMG_4007.JPG)

In pulling bramble down a hill, there is only one thing to do. Keep pulling, keep going. To stay in the moment, in the flow of pulling bramble down a hill. But the moment you turn around to see what foliage betrays your efforts&mdash;in that moment, your flow is interrupted. You're no longer subsumed in the forwardness of where you're going, but you become preoccupied with the impedance of that which is behind you (and whose observance does not make your work any easier or faster, but in fact only slows you down). I realized that instead of constantly turning my head and being annoyed at how much the bramble caught (and wondering how much longer it'd be till lunch), if I simply didn't look behind me and kept pulling (and if I felt something catch, just give an extra tug), it all went by much easier and quicker. I focused only on where I was going and what I was doing. And not only did time fly by, but it felt better. My work didn't feel as frustrating or as pointless.

![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tbua6Dcezfc/TqxlueEvlMI/AAAAAAAAA5Q/7chbr-0pV1Y/s1600/IMG_4019.JPG)

Pulling bramble down a hill is relatively simple, sure. But in life, the solutions to most problems turn out to be surprisingly simple too. Work a little harder, wait a little longer, love a little more. There are not many obstacles in life that aren't solved by doing one of these three things, in some way or another. And yet, when obstacles arise we wring our hands, we curse the heavens, we comment on our misfortune and enlist the commiseration of others. We roll around in our minds all the things that went wrong. We imagine all the different ways it could've happened, we stare at the clock and count down the seconds, we even count all the things wrong with the person we care about.

But in the end, the solution to any problem is always to look forwards, not backwards. To maintain the flow (or call it zen) of living in the moment and pushing forward, whatever it may be – whether in working, in waiting, in loving, or in dragging bramble down a hill. To look forwards, not backwards. This was the first lesson I learned.

#### The second lesson: the world around you is already full and beautiful.

We are all guilty of this. It's probably the gravest of all sins, and yet the most common&mdash;to forget the beauty of the world around you.  See, I had decided in my mind that when I got to the country that I would behold how beautiful the country is. And indeed, the French countryside is beautiful. I was not wrong that I would find it beautiful.

![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8efVR38kc4U/Tqxlk3nDdMI/AAAAAAAAA4w/CLmYDj3e9DI/s1600/IMG_3974.JPG)

But I remember one day, on my 8th or 9th day on the farm, I was doing some work outside a barn that faced a view of the hills surrounding the farm. My back was aching, so I got up, stretched a bit, and looked out towards the muggy fields. And I realized that although I'd only been on this farm for a week&mdash;I'd already forgotten about the beauty of where I was. I wasn't paying attention to it at all. After only a week, I was as blind to it as I would be to the grass in my backyard. And when I commanded myself back into reverence of this scene, the rolling hills and the empty expanse of greenness, it occurred to me&mdash;what's special about this? Being in the country, or being anywhere beautiful is not some kind of continuous rapture, not some continuous aesthetic bombardment of beauty and fantasy on your mind. It's no different from being anywhere else. You get used to it, and soon it just becomes background.

So why is it that when I'm home, back in Austin, Texas, I don't command myself to reverence of the beauty around me? All it takes is a conscious desire to appreciate the world. I always imagined that I would go to beautiful places around the world, and there I would be struck. I would be able to appreciate the world as it should be appreciated. But the world around you is already full, and it is already beautiful. Every moment you can look around you, assume a beginner's mind (in the buddhist sense), and appreciate the beauty that surrounds you. Beautiful places are nice. But they are also everywhere. And that is the second lesson.

![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-crToA3mGnVw/Tqxl7UJDy9I/AAAAAAAAA6I/i64Jg_SogVw/s1600/IMG_3780.JPG)

#### The third lesson: the world is silent.

Socrates once said that all learning is a fiction&mdash;that in the process we call learning, one's soul is merely remembering things it has always known. This is how this lesson strikes me. It's a simple lesson, perhaps one you've known all along&mdash;but it's one of which your soul must be reminded.

Go outside and walk around. Take out your earbuds, forget your phone, leave the chatter on the ground. Look up.

Stop.

And then keep walking.

![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-s4chErbdRbg/TqxmAnl6VrI/AAAAAAAAA6g/1g3tW_iqjGM/s1600/IMG_3834.JPG)

The world is silent. It is the world to which you always have and always will belong. No matter how society, or your friends, or your own mind tries to sculpt you, the world remains silent. No matter how hard you try to be liked, to be respected, to attain any perfection that you're utterly certain is worth striving for&mdash;the world will never give so much as a nod.

Stop thinking for a moment. Stop imagining who you are and the story of your life, why you matter to other people, why you matter to yourself. Stop commanding your humanness, and instead, listen to it.

The world is silent. The winds blow, trees sometimes waver and leaves sometimes fall, and the sun rises and sets all the same. The world says nothing to you. The world is silent. And this can be a comfort or it can be a great terror, depending on little more than one's perspective. But it also needn't be either. It can simply be.

And in that silence is the third and final lesson.

I wasn't sure that I was going to come here. I had toyed with the idea my mind many times, but I was never sure what to do. It wasn't until working on the farm in France that I finally made the decision. But I think all along somewhere in my journey, there was some invisible string that tied me to Portugal. And though I swung around in my arc through Europe, and though at times when the string went slack I would suspect myself free, and even at times declare it true&mdash;at some random moment I would think about my story, about the impetus of my journey, and Portugal would tug at me again like an impatient master, and I would remember.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FkdKLScgGDo">[video]</div>

> Lord, make me a channel of thy peace;
>  that where there is hatred, I may bring love;
>  that where there is wrong, I may bring the spirit of forgiveness;
>  that where there is discord, I may bring harmony;
>  that where there is error, I may bring truth;
>  that where there is doubt, I may bring faith;
>  that where there is despair, I may bring hope;
>  that where there are shadows, I may bring light;
>  that where there is sadness, I may bring joy.
>
> Lord, grant that I may seek rather to comfort than to be comforted;
>  to understand, than to be understood;
>  to love, than to be loved.
>  For it is by self-forgetting that one finds.
>  It is by forgiving that one is forgiven.
>  It is by dying that one awakens to eternal life.
>  Amen.

I decided to go to Portugal. I did not have to, but I wanted to know. I wanted to know who Jose was. Why he did what he did. I wanted to know what his story was behind all of this. I wanted to know what my lesson was.

Somewhere along my travels, someone asked me at some point about why I was debating whether or not to see Jose.  I thought about this for some time, and gave them this for an answer: I don't think about Jose anymore, in truth.  He doesn't arrest me anymore when I walk to and fro and ponder my life. My focus is only on myself, on who I am, and where I am going from here. So why do I think about seeing Jose? Well. I think it's because it all just feels so meaningless. From all the shit that happened, how am I supposed to grow from this experience? How do I become stronger? What am I supposed to learn? What's the great lesson that he came into my life to teach me? &ldquo;Don't trust people&rdquo;? That's so disgusting. I don't want that lesson, I don't want to learn that. There's something I need to understand about who Jose is, why he did what he did, and what it is about me that brought him into my life. And until I do that, my story is empty.

So I came to Portugal.

![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KJHWV0ylCSw/TrqK-KhSy5I/AAAAAAAABJ8/znLpEoeC7us/s1600/IMG_4095.JPG)

It's strange. I went to Guincho beach where I told him I would meet him. Guincho beach is near the west most point in all of Europe, cupped against the Atlantic. It was cold, and I walked along the beach back and forth, waiting for him to arrive. Evening turned to night, and the sea which at first seemed so sorry and melancholy became a colossal darkness. There was only one light along the entire beach. I walked back and forth, waiting. The photos that I took of the beach I took only an hour before Jose arrived, before it became dark.

![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kauxVhDZyKg/TrqLzyjbRtI/AAAAAAAABLQ/f9XrMcq6nFk/s1600/IMG_4230.JPG)

![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-k8dUNqbHZ4M/TrqM5U19KrI/AAAAAAAABMA/GgQa2RSkd_0/s1600/IMG_4313.JPG)

The first moment I saw him, I was climbing the steps to the embankment above the beach. He had arrived on his motorcycle. I had been thinking for a long time what I would do the first moment I saw him. I imagined sometimes that perhaps I would punch him in the gut, or perhaps that I would give him a measured and pregnant look in his eyes to communicate my anger and disappointment in him. And sometimes I imagined I just wouldn't know what to say, shake his hand, and say &ldquo;hey.&rdquo;

He took off his motorcycle helmet. I knew that he was 6 feet tall&mdash;a young and powerful rugby player. For some reason I thought he would be really tall. I always imagined I would look slightly up at him. I'm actually 5'11, but somehow it didn't occur to me that we were really close to the same height. And in that first moment that I faced him, I was almost surprised. He was the same person as in the pictures, but when I inspected him&mdash;his clothes, his face, the way he stood&mdash;it was so apparent. He was just a boy. He had an uncertain half-smile on his face. Under his chin was a small patch of acne. It hadn't appeared in the photos. He was 18 year old. It occurred to me that at 18, even the terrain of one's face is inconstant.

In that moment, I did not want to hate him, to curse him, or to show him he was unworthy. I wanted to forgive him, and to understand him. He put out his hand to shake mine. I pulled him in to hug him. And though I had my arm around him, he did not hug me back. He seemed uncertain of himself around me. He would later tell me that I made him nervous, and that meeting me felt surreal&mdash;that he didn't know how to act around me. He could sense my heaviness. He felt guilty for it. He felt sad. He didn't know what to do, or what to say. I could see it in him. And I forgave him for that too.

![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0ew1inRevyw/TrqLTAGdZNI/AAAAAAAABKk/B52ad-nEGr4/s1600/IMG_4130.JPG)

*It is by self-forgetting that one finds,
 And it is by forgiving that one is forgiven.*

Over the many days I was in Portugal, we spoke many times about many things. And I came to understand Jose. What his story really is, what made him into the person he is, and what led him to do what he did. What drives him. His fears, his insecurities, his particular brand of madness. I spoke to his mother and learned from her all that I could about Jose, and tried to communicate to her what I had learned as well. For five days I stayed in Cascais in a cheap little hotel by the marina. And every night I would go out to a little stretch of beach facing the sea, and I would pace back and forth along its meager coast. I would think, and think, and think. I sought to understand. To weave his story together. And in those moments when I would reach the end of the beach (I look down at my feet when I pace), I would turn around and face the long of the beach again, and&mdash;sometimes, looking over the path my footprints had traced again and again&mdash;I would feel such a tremendous sadness and loneliness that my impoverished words fall short to describe it.

And yet, I felt my soul accumulating itself. I came to understand. More about myself, about Jose, and about why our stories intertwined with one another the way they did. In the moment I left London almost three months ago, I felt like my soul had been shattered. I felt like I didn't know who I was anymore. I've been a professional poker player for 5 years. Poker was my lodestone, it was my meaning, it was how I knew in the end that I was worthy, that I was special, that my mind and my life were worth my struggles to uphold them. When I lost it, I felt like I was empty. And so I realize now that the purpose of my journey was to remember who I was. I am such an amazingly different person now than who I was 5 years ago, before I began my romance with the game of poker. So now I look inward and take stock of what's left. Who am I now? I pick up little pieces along the way as I travel, one on this day, one in this city, another one from this person. I don't have everything, and some pieces of my puzzle are still missing, perhaps under a couch or beneath a carpet somewhere, or maybe on the tongue of an insightful stranger. But it feels right. I am moving forward.

![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kfz0hL6HGTo/TrqNZl4kmHI/AAAAAAAABMM/z4hRzWw3YYw/s1600/IMG_4339.JPG)

Jose offered to let me stay at his place. I declined. It didn't feel right (though admittedly, I could've used the laundry machine, haha). For five days I stayed, met with him, wrote, paced, and slept. And I suppose that now I have my trophy, small that it may be, which is in knowing. The day before yesterday I returned to Lisbon, from which I flew back to London. I am now in Gloucester, and am facing the final chapter of my journey.

I will not write about all I learned about Jose. Not now. I still need to synthesize everything that I understood, and there are things that need to be said between the two of us that are yet unfinished and unsaid. That's okay, it can all wait. And when I write my book (not the one of which I spoke earlier in this blog, but the larger book that I am writing), I am sure I will write about all of it. But for now, a new episode has been opened in my life, and I stand here on the cusp of the first word.

I am about to go to a Vipassana meditation retreat in the British countryside. If you don't know what that is, I will explain simply – basically, it's a free (supported by donations) encampment out in the country. It lasts for ten days. One begins by turning in all of their unnecessary possession (i.e., phones, laptops, etc.), taking only clothes and the bare necessities of life. Then one takes a vow of what's called &ldquo;noble silence.&rdquo; This means that for the entirety of ten days, one will refrain from speaking, gesturing, writing, or any communication of any sort whatever. And over the ten days you are taught the art of Vipassana meditation, and for ten days you meditate.

I first heard about this from someone I met in eastern Europe. He told me that it's supremely intense. According to him, around day 5 is when everyone starts to go a little crazy&mdash;once you reach that fifth day, your mind starts to want to escape, starts to wrack itself with excuses as to why you can't stay and have to leave. But if you make it to day 10, he said, you will change.

I don't know why I decided to do this. I've never done anything of this sort before in my life. Hell, I've probably done yoga less than five times in my life and I'm terrible at meditating&mdash;I've always found the contents of my mind too noisy and various. There are probably lots of reasons why I'm doing this, some less obvious than others. But as I've been answering this question to the various people who've asked, there's one answer I gave of which I've grown fond. Which is: I am doing this because I know it will change me. And I want to change.

The truth is, I am afraid. I don't know what I will experience. But I want to see what happens when I come out of the other end of the fire.

I think of Alex.

In two hours the coach will arrive to take me into the countryside. Tomorrow morning I will begin the vow of silence.

I will write again at the end of ten days.

title: My Silence

---

Despite my promise to write once I got out, I have been silent on this blog for a month now. In fact, it's probably been about a month since I haven't hated any word of mine that has touched a page.

For those who are wondering what I've been up to&mdash;since the vow of silence I spent a few days in London and then finally flew back to Austin on the 24th of November. But what I returned to was not the peace and stability I had been looking forward to. My younger brother has been very mentally unwell. My parents were holding off on taking any drastic actions until I came home and had a chance to try to reach out to him, since I've always been the only person in the family he was comfortable with. So since I got back I have been staying with him and looking after him, but he kept getting worse. When he attempted suicide, we had no choice but to admit him to a clinic up in Houston on recommendation of his psychiatrist, and so I have been staying here with him by myself for the last two weeks and visiting him everyday. It has been difficult, and tiring to be honest. Once he returns home tomorrow I will try to continue to look after him and remain at his side until he gets better. It's a long story, as you can imagine. He is in a very dark and lonely place. And it seems I am the only one who can truly reach him.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TlUnd3x_34">[video]</div>

But in the meanwhile, my mind has been so chaotic and agitated that I've been unable to focus or write. Everything that comes out of it just seems like shit. I will try to be patient and to plow through whatever this next hill demands of me. But I hope that soon things will settle down and I can start to really put down my roots again… that somewhere on the other side of this, a healthy and nurturing space will coalesce for me. But until then, I wanted to write something in this blog. If for no other reason, to assure that I am still alive and (relatively) well, and that my damned mind is still as abuzz as ever. When I am ready to write and don't hate every attempt to put metaphorical pen to paper, I will write about what I experienced during the 10 days of silence, and how it affected me.

I apologize for my silence. And know that I hate what a writer I am, as much as probably a lot of you do.

But also know that I intend to become better. And that when I am ready, I am going to write something great.

Hello friends,

It has been a long time since I've written. Too long really, though perhaps it has taken me this long for good reason. It still surprises me that people occasionally e-mail me, asking what I'm up to and why I'm not writing in this blog anymore. Apparently my story is meaningful to people, which in the back of my mind I find difficult to comprehend. But for my own part, my life and thoughts have been scattered all over the place. Let me give you some idea of what my life has been since my return to Austin.

![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-e_m_1WPtars/T3X7vMrcuSI/AAAAAAAABOY/--FPmIU5ojw/s1600/IMG_4596.JPG)

When I got home, one of the first decisions I made was that I was going to re-enroll in university and finish my degree. I had abandoned it when I was 20, despite only having a year left, because I wanted to spend more time focusing on poker. Since then people always told me, once you walk away from university it doesn't matter if you say it's only temporary&mdash;most people never go back and finish. It just never ends up happening. Well, that didn't sit right with me. So the first thing I decided I was going to do was wrap up my degree, and with grades that I could respect. While I was playing poker I stopped giving much emphasis on grades, ditched classes, became disillusioned with the whole project of academia, and so it's been a challenge to engender more rigorous habits.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TFom-ozMsT0">[video]</div>

But more than that, my focus has been to better myself. Since the ten day vow of silence I took, I have been trying to understand how to become the man I want to be. I have started rock-climbing, training boxing and Jeet Kune Do, getting into running, working on my writing, reading furiously (a pastime I largely abandoned while I was a poker player), practicing my photography, eating better and more simply (sans grains), I started volunteering teaching an English class to refugees once a week, and I have been trying to direct myself to live more simply, frugally and peacefully. Most of these are things I haven't done before, or at least with the acuteness with which I am doing them now. I am changing. Buddhists believe strongly in the idea of &ldquo;purifying the self,&rdquo; a notion which seems right to me, even though I'm unsure exactly what it means. To what am I trying to distill myself? What is the  substrate that underlies who I am? I'm not sure, but the process seems the right one. It feels like progress, and I suppose that's good enough.

I think about Alex often. I try to resolve myself, to see that I am what I do. I think about how to choose what is difficult, how to say yes to it, how to make my entire life into one overwhelming &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;

![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GJ6_AhuS4MM/T3X74imy0zI/AAAAAAAABO4/lVKMqMiLmCs/s1600/IMG_4611.JPG)

My time in Gloucester rattled me when it came to that. It was ten days of pain, frustration, and reflection. Of eating very simple, very little (very vegetarian) food. Meditating on my life, on my shortcomings, on who I am. But more than that, spending ten days separated from all but the essentials of living, well, it made me reflect on just how much extraneous crap I've always let into my life.

How do you live better? Become a better person? Connect with people more? Live by your wisdom? Appreciate the world around you?

I guess you could say I've been trying to forge a new identity for myself. It occurred to me that for a long time, I was DogIsHead. Some of you might wonder what I mean by that, but some of you get it. Haseeb was never important. I took a back seat to DogIsHead, who had a life of his own, like a roaring train on which I was a mere passenger. Very few knew me, really. I was just the double who followed that greater name around.

But DogIsHead is gone. I am not him anymore. And so I realized on my travels through Europe, I could no longer tell people I was a poker player. It didn't make sense, that wasn't who I was. Then what was I? What did I have left? I was just a kid. I was just who I was. I was Haseeb. And I realized that part of the tremendous sadness I felt was that I was grieving. I was grieving the death of DogIsHead, grieving the end of my first adult identity. I had to pick up where I left off, to disembark from the train and stand on the hard ground with my own two feet. In a sense, it's a rather simple thing – the business of being, of personhood. But at that moment, and sometimes even now, it is hard to know what to do with it.

![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QWjJ0XAX1yw/T3X7-QWiswI/AAAAAAAABPg/sSurrj36NHg/s1600/IMG_4647.JPG)

This is an expansive thing, and in a way I don't know where to start or if I'm making any progress. But one thing I do know is it has been a relief. a great relief, to be away from the poker world. To just be a normal person again. Well, maybe normal isn't quite the word, but at least someone unextraordinary. In the past even while I was in school I was always a student second, and a poker player first. Poker always seemed to take primacy. It was the hungry cyclops that domineered the cave of my life. It has been nice to live for myself for a while.

But I realize that something is missing. It's not quite right. I wanted to get away from poker, from this world, from the eyes of others, and to be immersed in the world of the living again, to simply be for my own sake&mdash;it was something I desperately needed. I needed to be there for my brother (who is gradually improving these days), to re-assume my place in my family, to re-figure my place among friends, old poker buddies, within the world around me and within myself. It has all been important. But, I must also admit that I've been running away from this. From the poker world. The past. The judgment, the eyes of the crowd, the being-for-others.

![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FanNHXqcVAk/T3X780NiyRI/AAAAAAAABPY/6jAva6Kl5M8/s1600/IMG_4644.JPG)

Running from it is not the answer either. I have been thinking about this lately. Though I needed to get away from the poker world, away from this defunct identity of mine as a poker player, there is something insincere and reactionary about trying to shut it out the way I have.

Allow me to tell you a brief story. Spring Break was coming up about a couple weeks ago, along with SXSW, the biggest yearly music festival in Austin. It's a huge sprawling week-long event, with film and amazing music and revelry. There were many bands that I wanted to see. But on the day before Spring Break began, I realized&mdash;that I was tired. Tired in a deep, muddy sort of way. Although there was much that I might have wanted to see, I knew in some part of my mind that I wouldn't be able enjoy it. There would be a frustration underlying it all. I couldn't explain why I felt this, but I knew it was there. I decided to leave. I needed some time to myself, to try to shake off this heaviness that clung to me. On the night before I left, I sent out an e-mail to a couple I found in Durango, Colorado who wanted volunteers for a leveling job. They told me they'd be happy to host me, and so I decided that's where I would go. I drove up there (a 16 hour drive) by myself the morning after my classes ended. When I arrived there, the couple showed me to where I would be staying – a tent next to a firepit, hidden in the brush of this plot of land they had recently purchased. The land was situated on a foothill, not far from the Rockies. They told me that they would not be able to provide me with much, and so to do as much work leveling the land as I saw fit.

I spent that week alone, in a self-created solitude.

In that time I saw a lot of the landscapes, went hiking on the Colorado trail, and met some fascinating people while I was there. But most of the time I spent alone, contemplating. It occurred to me that maybe the reason why I brought myself there was that some part of me knew instinctively that I needed to stop for a moment. To recede from the clamor and rally of my life, and take stock. To remember who I am, where I'm going, to be able to see beyond the breadth of a moment or a day. This is important.

And it was there that I decided it was time to return and to face this. Poker was an important part of my life. And in truth, it still is. I can't get away from that, and it would be dishonest to try, or to pretend. I'm not a poker player anymore, that's for certain. But nevertheless, I am very much a part of this world in my own way. I am a child of poker. I need to think about what I can give of value back to  this world. When I thought about it, I realized that in all my time as a poker player, what gave me the most pleasure and satisfaction was in teaching, in helping others. There is always something more meaningful about doing for others than for oneself&mdash;this is something which poker does its very best to obscure from our minds (the emphasis is always on protecting information, on looking out for your own EV and no one else's). Despite being a teacher, I always considered it something secondary while I was a poker player. But I realize now it's the only thing that sticks. The people who I've helped, and the value I offered them is the only thing on which I ever look back with fondness.

That's what I want to do. In my time as a poker coach I coached well over a hundred poker players. But I don't want to coach poker strategy anymore, especially since I haven't played in such a long time&mdash;that's no longer my domain, and I'm not interested in that. But when I was a poker coach, I taught my students more than simply strategy&mdash;I taught them how to learn, how to control tilt, how to think about themselves, how to manage their emotions and engage their rationality, and in a sense how to be a poker player in the first instance. The psychological side of things, which I learned not only in my personal study, but in my experience as a poker player and as a teacher. How to how to balance and manage one's life, how to navigate the labyrinth of the gambling world, how to live well in spite of the beast we call poker. The living, more aqueous side of the game.

I still want to help people. I don't know if these abilities are truly helpful to others, but I want to know if they are.

So I've decided to take this on as an experiment to see if this is something I am capable of. I want to take four clients from among the readers of my blog. To be a candidate you must be a serious poker player, play serious stakes and have a decent amount of experience, be capable of learning and following directives&mdash;but most importantly, you must have serious issues in either tilt, learning, or self-management. This is something I want to explore. So for one month, I will be doing this for free, just to help people and see what impact I can have. I want to see what happens. If you are interested in this, please send me an e-mail to [haseebcoach at gmail dot com](mailto:haseebcoach@gmail.com). Include details about what stakes you play, a (brief) poker history, and what your main issues are. I will choose four people to work with over the coming month, and see what comes of it.

On a concluding note, I told you guys before that I was going to write something in depth about the ten days I spent in Gloucester. I ended up writing something&mdash;it was very intense and personal, and as it happens, long. It ran about 21 pages single spaced. But after poring it over carefully, I don't like how I wrote it. I'm going to keep it to myself for now, but it has been a good experiment for me in writing, and I am gradually honing my craft. By the time I finish  my book, I hope I will have something more complete. Something I can be proud of. It will take time, but I am learning. I apologize to you who were looking forward to the story, but perhaps it is better after all that I spare you mine, so that you might be made curious enough to seek out one of your own. Also, I want to thank everybody for the kind and encouraging comments re: my family situation. We are all doing better, and I believe things will only improve.

To end, I wanted to include for you guys a short piece I wrote while I was camping in Colorado. It was spurred by the storm of confusion and frustration I felt, which tends to form when one is alone. It is personal, but I wanted to share it with you all. I hope you guys can appreciate it.

## Looking into the Fire

I sit in silence before the fire pit. It is darkness now at my campsite. I say darkness rather than nighttime, because when you have lived your life in the city as I have, nighttime refers to a certain period of ease and comfort after the day is done. Sure, in the city the sky darkens, cools, hunches low to the ground just as it does out here. But it is a relaxed, easily-lit night, a restful intermission between periods of productivity. And of course, you are assured that nighttime is safe. That the darkness that subsumed the sky is only a formality; a nod to less modernized times, perhaps. Your burglar alarm is cocked, your heater shields you from the cold, and the paneled lights of Denny's and Wal-Mart go on humming into the night, prepared to save you should tonight be the night you need saving. Indeed, in the city the dark is snuffed out, with the gentle glow of nighttime inserted in its place.

But out here, there is darkness. There are no streetlights to illuminate the trails to my campsite. There is no white noise to comfort my ears. There are no walls to hide me. I look up, and there is only the emptiness of the world. I crane my neck to find the end of it, but the emptiness widens, like a great maw threatening to swallow me up. Oh. I see stars. Tiny innocent specks. Though it is cloudy, I can make them out here and there. But in reality they are more than just specks. That, up there, is the universe. Of course, I cannot see it really, since the actual universe is a dazzling cornucopia, endlessly dappled with orbs of color. Or so I am led to believe. But here, the stars are small, whitish points.

I want to make sense of it. This haphazard celestial splatter, looking down on me. There is an unmoving aloofness to it all. There are no faces or figures. It is unloving, unhating. I strain to voice the overwhelming question: Why? How? Says Who? But it is as though I am in a dream where I want to shout but find my vocal cords are suddenly missing, and I hear only a frozen, internal scream. In this dream nothing comes out, but it wouldn't matter, because I couldn't be heard anyway. We've all felt it before. Look up there in the darkness. On a chilly night like this, you would hope to see something looking back at you, some emotion or artifice beneath it all. But all I see is this, a faceless infinite swirl. It watches me in silence. It says nothing.

If only I were not here, if only there were no one here to behold all this namelessness. It oppresses me, it rots my head like a peach under the sun. If there were no one here, then the question could never have been asked, and we would all be the better for it. We might all be saved, be free, in a sense. But things are the way they are, I suppose. This goes without saying.

I look down again, rejoining my campsite, but it is too dark to make anything out. My lungs go on, busily pumping out the business of breathing. Cold tingles in my ears, and I hear the barking of a dog in the distance. The dog belongs to a neighbor who lives on the next plot of land on this foothill at the base of the Rocky Mountains. The dog was barking before&mdash;it always does when it senses me here, an obnoxious habit&mdash;but now its cries have become more intense. It is not quite a howl. Instead it is a long ululating bellow, as though it is wrenched in pain. I am paining it. I am an intruder into nature, and the dog feels it; it announces this to me in the language that all creatures know. This is a simple thing. I do not belong here.

The firewood is prepared from earlier in the day. I crumple up a local newspaper sheet by sheet, catching glancing phrases as I do: the plights of city budgets, the passing of winter fashions, advice for the lovestruck. A woman, a passionate fling with a charming Australian businessman, and now she can't stop thinking about him. How does she know if it's really love, she asks? Confused in Chicago. I stuff the cold balled up sheets into the crevices between pieces of wood.

The design I have made is ugly and slipshod, but it'll do. I light the paper. It is stubborn at first, but after applying my lighter in a few spots the paper starts to throw up flames of its own. Paper burns fast and theatrically; it makes a show of itself. But I am unsure whether it will take to the wood. I cannot know. I can only watch and wait.

![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hiCdSKoIjRo/T3X7qcqxnmI/AAAAAAAABN4/3mSIMGipQZ4/s1600/IMG_4678.JPG)

A fire contains many things. And for that reason there are few things that are quite as absorbing as a fire. There must be some part of my DNA that remembers what it was to be a prehistoric man, squatting over its warmth, entranced by its flickering existence. He must have understood how unlike fire is to the rest of the world. When he looked around him he saw a stone-faced earth, catatonic gods, a night that abandoned him in darkness. But here, in this crackling fire, was life, flitting and fluttering like a furious heart. Yes, fire contains many things – the warming nurture of a mother, the sputter and sharpness of a man. It is the human essence. Even the Greeks knew it.

I came here, to this campsite, to escape the world. My anger, which follows me wherever I go. The frustration of hapless love, of my unfinished self, being reminded again and again that I do not know who I want to be. But these things are not important, and in a sense they melt away when one is not looking. I gaze into the fire, into the burning face of life. It has taken to the wood now, it cracks and hisses, coughs up puffs of smoke. The blaze is alive. This is existence. Here, in this fire, is everything. The heat of movement, the sting of pain, the light of living. In this moment, I am here. I am me, being myself, sitting by this fire alone on this foothill at the base of the Rocky Mountains, having lost what I never had. Benevolence and malevolence in one fiery mind. This is the only answer.

And alone up here, looking into this fire, I think of anger. Of acceptance. Of oxidation and combustion, of the long of life, and the health of loved ones. A fire contains these things too. I think of Rilke, of Nietzsche, of Kierkegaard. I think of the poker gods, of Alex and his hands buried in his pockets, of my brothers. I am them and they are me. I am the fire. I begin to catch. My eyes, my legs, my clothes are consumed. And my heart, which is motionless, must be in the fire too. Nothing escapes, nothing escapes the cleansing violence of the fire.

Even the past, and the dog who moans plaintively in the distance.

Nothing but love,

Hey everyone,

Sorry for being slow to update this blog. It's somewhat lame of me, I know, but I've been tremendously busy this last month. I was slogging through finals and finally finished this first semester, was working through the month of free mental coaching, and a slew of other things in my personal life – I started working with Habitat for Humanity (it's a volunteer construction gig, which is pretty brutal in the summer Texas sun… but it's good for the soul), I started doing podcasts interviewing poets for Jane Crown Poetry Radio, have been training JKD (I got my younger brother to start working out with me!), I've been trying to eat a Paleo diet, and have been working hard on writing. My life has been full and challenging.

The month of mental coaching went really well. At first I was nervous and uncertain as to whether I'd really be able to help people, but the more hours I put in, the more I realized just how capable I am and how much my students were improving. After all, I'd taught hundreds of poker players before, and getting into a student's mind was always an integral part of coaching. I had to deal with all sorts of issues&mdash;tilt, motivation, creativity, study habits, playing habits, and overall lifestyle. It was a fascinating and edifying experience, and I'm happy that I genuinely helped everyone I coached.

It's strange though, when I compare my life to what it was before. I don't really to talk to many people from the poker world anymore. Even this mental coaching was strange for how much it brought me back into the world of poker. Using the lingo, getting into their minds, remembering what it's like to be a grinder. Just the other day, one of my students asked me if I missed the game.

![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CSxpd3827iI/TpIKwYdAhHI/AAAAAAAABHA/F6dScCvBZpY/s1600/IMG_3629.JPG)

If I missed the game? Man. It's a good question. Do I miss poker, you ask?

<div class="caption">Cologne, Germany.</div>

I don't have a desire to play the game, if that's what you're asking. The love I once had for poker is gone. I don't want it back. And yet&mdash;I remember a couple months ago, I was driving to school, not focused on anything in particular. I was just being lost in my own thoughts, daydreaming, zoning out. The car in front of me was a black Dodge Durango. I read its license plate &ldquo;C3Y J98&rdquo;&mdash;and all of a sudden J98 appeared to me like a poker board. I found myself wishing I had QT, thinking about check/raising this board&mdash;the letters became like a landscape; I could see the small but treacherous valley between the J and the 9 that made that board so vicious. Once again I was face to face with the cards, as if the entire world was comprised only of this moment, of my hand, of J98.

It was only when the light turned green and the car receded from me that I realized what was had happened. It was like an acid flashback. As I drove on, trailing behind this car, I wasn't sure what to make of that experience. I hadn't played a single hand of poker since I quit poker all those months ago; almost 9 months now. I had left all that behind. And yet, here it was again. I realized my heart was pounding. I didn't know what it meant. Was it nostalgia? Or was it just some proof of how deeply poker has penetrated into me; how the patterns of behavior and perception are so inextricably wired into my brain, and maybe all this will never go away, not even when I'm an old and decrepit?

Five years I spent as a poker player. Eating, living, breathing poker. Why would I think I could get away from it?

<div class="caption">Bled, Slovenia.</div>

I have spent the last five months in school, just being a student again. I've managed to get all A's my first semester, which is an accomplishment for me, since in the past I never bothered much about university while playing poker. Not that it matters really, and it's doubtful I'll ever be getting a job that particularly cares about my GPA. But it matters to me. I want to prove to myself that I'm capable of more than poker.

For a long time, I was scared of TwoPlusTwo. It's hard to even admit that to myself even now, and it feels silly to say. But it was true. I still remember when I was traveling through Europe, I was terrified of it. The URL would be poised there on my browser, like an old door waiting to be opened. It was a door full of hatred, teeming with rancor and judgment. I would look at it and I would feel my body tighten up like a fist. I knew that beyond the door were people talking about me like I was a piece of shit. Cursing my name into the ground. Calling me and everything I've done a sham.

I had admitted to the wrongs I had done. I knew that people were making up things. Saying that I'm a scammer, saying that I'm a con artist, saying that I'm a sociopath, that I don't care for my friends, that all I care about is money. What did any of them know? I was the only one who knew all the people involved, only I lived through it, only I knew the lived truth of what I did. Hadn't I already answered to everyone I needed to answer to? Hadn't I been tasked with making sense of it all, with moving on? So why should I care what these people were saying?

The fear took hold of me. I didn't want to know what people were saying about me anymore. And when you're told so many times, by so many people who were part of your community, that you're a piece of shit&mdash;how could you not come to believe them? How could you not wonder that maybe they were right, that you're garbage after all, and everything you believed about yourself was somehow a lie?

<div class="caption">Ljubljana, Slovenia.</div>

As I traveled, I searched myself, trying to find the failure that they said I was. While sitting in trains across Europe, while working on the farm in the south of France, while meditating for ten days in Gloucester&mdash;I scoured myself for every failing I could find. But when you start looking, who doesn't find failings inside them? Who isn't self-interested? Who doesn't have an ego? Who doesn't recoil from fear?

I have thought long and hard about what it means to be a good person. I have wondered if it really is true that I didn't care for anyone. If there's just something about me that's wrong, that's unsalvageable, something that makes me some kind of moral miscreant. I had read this so many times, in truth, I started to believe it. When I came home, I started volunteering teaching English to refugees. I began working volunteer construction. I started hosting people passing through Austin from Couchsurfing, trying to take care of young travelers. I started living more simply, hoping perhaps it would get to the root of things. I kept hoping in all of it to finally find some revelation, believing that it would bubble up to me if I worked hard enough.

But the real world has less to say. No one cares that I used to be a poker player. People smile at me. They tell me that I am a promising young man. They tell me to come back again next week. That they can use the help.

<div class="caption">Padova, Italy.</div>

My story is mine alone. And that has been lonely, but it is probably the way it should be.

In a way&mdash;and perhaps it is a cliche to say, but I will say it nevertheless&mdash;I am grateful it all happened. I am grateful that I made the mistakes I did. I am grateful that I was ostracized, decried, hated. I am grateful too that people even accused me of things I didn't do. I am grateful that I left the poker world. I am grateful that I felt alone, that I questioned myself, that it all forced me to invent myself all over again. I am grateful that I couldn't rely on anyone else to figure out who I am, to learn how to live, to learn how to grow. It is all good for me. It will all make me stronger.

The poker world, in the end, is a community like any other. It has its own hierarchy, its own rules, its own communal philosophy. But in membership in any artificial community, you cease to simply be yourself. Your identity is accorded to its rules. You become your poker identity&mdash;nothing else is of value in that world. But in being part of that, you forget the place where poker ends and where real life begins. And the truth is, there is no such place. Poker is just a part of life&mdash;and in the business of personhood and making one's way on this planet, trying to live well and be good to people, trying to simply be human&mdash;well, it's a relatively small part of it all. That seems obvious, but it's easy to forget. I forgot it often. I still forget it sometimes.

Today I was reading through TwoPlusTwo for the first time in a long time. I read all of the things people say about me. It's pretty bad. People think I'm worthless, they think I'm trash. That's okay. It's hard to read that stuff, but it's okay. I can't blame them. In that world I am just an image; a résumé of sins. That's alright. In a way, that's how it should be.

<div class="caption">Lisbon, Portugal.</div>

Some people think I'm going to play poker again. It has even been suggested that I am playing poker now. The truth is, I haven't played a hand of poker since I left all those months ago. In fact, I made a bet with somebody that if I ever became a professional poker player again I would pay that person $50,000. I know I can make money at poker. I know that poker will always be there. I know that it is lucrative. I know I can go back if I want.

But I don't want to do that to myself. I don't want to become that. I want to grow and evolve as a person. What more could I learn from making money again as a poker player? I have done it long enough to know that there is nothing more in that world for me. I want to struggle. I want to feel anxiety. I want to be lost, confused, and to be forced to start over. Fear is the only way forward.

I used to think when I was younger that I wasn't meant to be a gambler. I was always nitty with my bankroll; I never played Blackjack or craps, or spent much money on anything frivolous, really, and I loathed casinos. I always found it odd that I had become a professional poker player when I hated the notion of gambling.

I realize now that I was right; I wasn't meant to be a gambler. But I needed to try it and learn that for myself.

<div class="caption">Albi, France.</div>

The world is so big! I forget it sometimes. I have met so many people since I left poker, and I have grazed against so many worlds. It really is amazing how big it is, and how small I am. I want to be impoverished. I want to be stupidly in love with it all.

I really have no idea what I'm supposed to be! But this is a good place to start. I want to use the skills I have learned in my career as a poker player to help people. It feels good to be put to work again, and to be able to use all of my faculties to help someone move through obstacles I've moved through in the past.

I'll write something more substantive about my mental coaching, but I probably won't be able to take on many clients for a while. I'll be swamped taking two full summer terms and a full fall term, all while working on writing these book projects. So I only want to take on as many people as I can be fully devoted to. If you're possibly interested in working with me on your mental poker game&mdash;to break through any weaknesses in tilt, motivation, or learning&mdash;e-mail me at haseebcoach at gmail dot com. After consulting some of the clients I've worked with, I've set my rate at $125/hr.

I've included in this blog post a reprise of my favorite photos that I took through my journey across Europe. I hope that you enjoyed them. Sorry if this blog post was rather desultory; I just had a lot on my mind that I needed to get out. I feel a bit better now.

I know it's cheesy, but I've been reading some Mary Oliver lately, and I wanted to end this blog with a poem that has stuck in my mind. I hope it speaks to you as it spoke to me.

## In a Nutshell

I first stumbled into poker when I was 16. I started with $50 and within a year, turned it into $100,000. A couple years later, I was a millionaire, considered at the age of 19 to be among the best No-limit Heads-up Texas Hold'em players in the world.

I taught poker players all over the world. I made instructional videos, wrote articles, traveled, and coached other poker pros.

In 2011, when I was twenty-one, I got entangled in what came to be known as the Girah Scandal, a big affair in the online poker world. In it I lied to the poker community, trying to protect myself and my friends. A little while later, I decided to retire from the game of poker for good. Since then, I haven't played a hand of poker.

In 2012, I returned to the United States to look after my family and finish my education. I continued to write about poker, to coach poker players, and most importantly, to work on myself. I then published my first book, [*How to Be a Poker Player: The Philosophy of Poker*](https://haseebq.com/book/). It became the #1 best-selling poker book on Amazon for about five months.

But despite that, I was unhappy. I felt burdened by poker&mdash;both by what I'd accomplished and by the mistakes I'd made. So I decided to start over. I donated all of my savings from my career as a poker player, almost $500,000. I gave some of it to charity, and the rest to my family. After all was said and done, I left myself with $10,000 with which to start anew.

In 2014, I made the decision to devote my life to Effective Altruism. I pledged to earn-to-give with my career, meaning that I would pursue a high-earning career so I could donate a substantial portion of my lifetime income to high-impact charities. This, now, has become my principal mission in life.

In 2015, I matriculated into App Academy, the most elite coding bootcamp in San Francisco, so that I could pursue a career in tech. I quickly rose to the top of my class, and after two months into the three-month bootcamp, I was asked to join the instructional team. Three months later, I was promoted to Director of Product. Now, I'm working at Airbnb while earning-to-give. I'm currently donating 33% of everything I make.

This, in a nutshell, is the story of my life.

## Poker

The first hand of Texas Hold'em I ever played, I had no idea what I was doing. I was sixteen, and some friends had invited me to play a game of poker. I didn't know what checking was, how betting rounds worked, or which hands beat what. I lost immediately. Frustrated by my naiveté, I decided to look up how poker worked. Soon, poker strategy captured my fascination. The more I read about it, the more it seemed there was a universe of complexity nestled inside this card game. I wanted to try my hand at it.

I started with $50 that I got for free from an online promotion&mdash;I had no money of my own to deposit&mdash;and painstakingly grinded my way up from 5-cent 10-cent games. I only played cash games and was relentlessly cautious with my bankroll. It was all I had. Before long, $50 became $200, became $2,000, and by the end of my first year, became over $100,000.

At 19, I'd become a heads-up NL and PLO specialist and started dominating high stakes. I began coaching poker players, teaching and producing videos for the leading poker instructional sites Deucescracked and Cardrunners, writing articles, and traveling. I was considered one of the strongest heads-up poker players in the world, got sponsored by Full Tilt Poker as a &ldquo;Red Pro,&rdquo; and did a [a few other cool things](http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/54/poker-beats-brags-variance/no-one-can-call-j-high-277285/) along the way. One of my most widely publicized matches was when [I took on and beat poker celebrity Gus Hansen at $100K buyin PLO games.](http://www.pokerlistings.com/gus-hansen-doesnt-enjoy-internet-pokers-37819)

But despite my success, as the years went on, I gradually started to lose my passion for the game. I'd withdrawn from school to play poker full time, but I knew I didn't want to play poker forever. In many ways, my relationship with poker was more of happenstance than choice. It wasn't who I wanted to be. As I grew older, poker made me feel more isolated and unfulfilled. It made me unhappy. I came close to quitting a few times, but my friends always talked me out of it&mdash;when, after all, was I ever going to be able to make money like that again?

Despite my ambivalence, I continued playing on and off until 2011. Then, Black Friday hit, when the DOJ shut down the two major American online poker sites, and the U.S. online poker market went awry. Not long after, so did my life.

----

## The Girah Scandal

My entanglement with the Girah Scandal began when, in 2010, I was contacted by a young Portuguese boy named José Macedo, who went by the name of &ldquo;Girah.&rdquo; He said he was a fan of mine, he had learned a lot from my teachings, and wanted some advice on his career. He was only 17, but he was already very successful. I found him surprisingly forthright, even naïve. I liked him. He soon befriended me, as he did many high stakes pros, and before long, I became his mentor.

He continually sought my advice and I supplied it. Eventually he asked me to become his manager and to back and coach him, alongside my friend Daniel Cates (a.k.a. Jungleman12). I'd never considered anything of the sort before, but I could not deny that José's career was growing rapidly. People had started calling him the &ldquo;Portuguese Poker Prodigy.&rdquo; I had seen the poker world chew up and spit out many young superstars, and I didn't want to see the same happen to José. I agreed, and set to helping him establish his career. I cared for him. I wanted him to succeed.

Then, one night in the August of 2011, everything changed. I learned that José had cheated his friends out of large sums of money. When I confronted him, he fled. I contacted the victims, explaining to them what happened, and then tried to protect José as best I could. I hoped that José could pay them back along with reparations, and that they'd refrain from telling the public about it and destroying his career. I thought I could protect him. But my plea backfired.

When news of the cheating came out, the poker community exploded with anger. And when the victims revealed that I had tried to protect José, that wrath turned on me. More and more information started to come out about just how much José had been deceiving everyone, including Daniel and me. Not wanting the extent of our relationship public, I lied to the community about my history with José. But those lies quickly dissolved, and the truth was discovered. Before long, I was reviled in the poker world&mdash;even more so than José himself.

I was dropped from my sponsorship. My career, which I had painstakingly built over five long years, was now in tatters. Although I could still make money, there seemed to be little else for me in the world of poker. Broken and heavy-hearted, I decided to leave the game for good.

I settled my affairs, said goodbye to my friends, and left my old life behind.

I was a poker player no more. Now, I was just a twenty one year-old kid.

The months that followed were scattered and bleak. I wandered from country to country. I wrote. I reflected on the person I'd become. I interrogated myself, blamed myself, forgave myself, and played out different versions of history in my mind. Mostly, I was alone.

I felt stranded. I hated myself. I didn't know what should come next.

----

## Starting Over

In the year that followed, I searched desperately for what I should do. I lived and worked on a farm, took a ten-day vow of silence, trained in meditation, finished my abandoned English/philosophy degree, volunteered teaching ESL to refugees, and wrote extensively.

In December 2013, I published my first book, [How to Be a Poker Player: The Philosophy of Poker](https://www.haseebq.com/book/). It was the culmination of everything I'd learned in my career as a poker player. It was also the book that long ago, I promised myself I'd someday write. Surprisingly, it was a total success.

But I knew that I needed to put an end to that chapter of my life. It was time to start over.

[I gave away all the money I made from poker.](https://www.haseebq.com/starting-over/) I donated $75,000 of cash to charity, and deeded my other assets to my parents, to go towards their retirement. I wanted a clean slate. Although my relationship with poker was always rocky, it wasn't until then that I could really see how incredibly nurturing it was to me. I wanted to pay that kindness forward. And I wanted to prove to myself that I was truly better off for having done poker at all. Not for the money, but for what it taught me.

I continued to work for a year as a mind coach, training professional poker players, entrepeneurs, and daytraders on the mental and psychological skills I'd learned from mastering the highest levels of poker. I wanted to help others. And slowly and steadily, I was moving closer to the person I wanted to be.

----

## Effective Altruism

So when, in 2014, I came across the writings of [a little movement known as Effective Altruism](http://whatiseffectivealtruism.com), the course of my life was irrevocably changed.

The basic premise of Effective Altruism is this: that altruism is not as straightforward as most of us like to pretend it is. That charity is not about symbolic displays or feeling good, but rather about actually helping people as much as possible. And in order to be sure we're really doing things that help, we must challenge our assumptions and be intellectually rigorous about what actually does good.

In short, Effective Altruism demands a scientific approach to charity. It also requires you to be willing to accept conclusions that are uncomfortable or unorthodox if the evidence or reasoning is strong enough. This is exactly what happened to me.

When I read the original argument [posed by William MacAskill](http://qz.com/57254/to-save-the-world-dont-get-a-job-at-a-charity-go-work-on-wall-street/) on why you should earn-to-give&mdash;that is, why you should take a high-paying career so you can donate the money to charity&mdash;I could not disagree. The logic seemed to me to be quite irrefutable. Uncomfortable and weird as it was, it was right. Indeed, as a privileged beneficiary of a first-world economy, if someone like me wouldn't do it, who would? I decided then that this is what I should do with my life.

I made up my mind to earn-to-give, to devote my life to donating money to the best charities in the world. The only thing left… was how.

----

## Earning-to-give

Heavily influenced by [80000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/articles/top-careers/), I decided that the best fit for my skillset would be to go into tech entrepreneurship. Given my appetite for and understanding of risk and uncertainty, my love of the Internet and technology, it seemed like a natural fit. I just had to find some way of breaking into the ecosystem.

I considered getting an MBA. But when I stumbled upon the world of coding bootcamps, I knew I'd found my path. People with no background at all had taken these bootcamps, learned how to code, and gotten hired at the top tech companies in the world. If I did this, I wouldn't have to wait two years to finish a degree before I could earn-to-give. I could do it immediately. Most of all, it represented a new mountain to climb, fresh and white, towering over me.

The allure was irresistible. I applied in a flurry to every single bootcamp in San Francisco. My top choice was [App Academy](http://appacademy.io), one of the most selective coding schools in the world with a less than 5% acceptance rate, owing in large part to its tuition-free model. For two ecstatic weeks I did nothing but study the Ruby language, barely eating or leaving my room, so that I could pass my interviews.

My flurry of preparation paid off. I was accepted to App Academy. In April of 2015, I moved to San Francisco and matriculated into App Academy. The second career of my life was poised to begin.

-----

## App Academy

I worked my ass off to learn programming. I was routinely the last person to leave, working from 9AM to midnight or later, 7 days a week. I was voracious, and from my career in poker, I had already learned *how to learn*. My work paid off: despite my background, I quickly rose to the top of my class.

At the end of the first 8 weeks of the 12-week course, the founders whisked me into a room and asked me to join the instructional team. I accepted the offer. Two months after my excursion into tech, I had gotten my first job. I could now start earning-to-give.

I rose up quickly as an instructor. After gaining the confidence of the two founders, I was promoted three months later to Director of Product for App Academy. I was tasked not only with helping to write curriculum and teach the bootcamp (and the three-week algorithms curriculum), but also to work alongside the CEO to develop new products, establish partnerships, lead the revenue strategy, and grow App Academy.

That's how my first year of earning-to-give came to a close. I donated 1/3rd of my pre-tax salary for 2015, which came to around 21k (I was salaried since June 2015). I intend to continue giving a third in 2016, and hopefully someday, pledge a third of the company that I will someday found.

----

## Airbnb

Now I'm working as a software engineer at Airbnb. [More stories forthcoming…!]

So that's what I'm about. Now you know me.

Outside of the aforementioned, I can be found reading, writing, meditating, training kickboxing, watching improv comedy, and picking up heavy things and putting them down. I still work as a mind coach on the side. I eat a paleo diet, which I think is mostly arbitrary, but I follow it anyway. I plan to become a vegetarian someday, but I don't have the moral fortitude yet. I try to fast one full day a week. You can [contact me here](https:/haseebq.com/connect/) if you're into that sort of thing.

Hey all,

Some of you will remember that a while back I wrote a blog post detailing an e-book that I wanted to write. It was originally titled &ldquo;To the Young Professional Poker Player,&rdquo; and I meant for it to be the embodiment of the most valuable ideas that I never had a chance to communicate in my career as a teacher of poker. I intended to release it freely for anyone in the poker world to benefit from.

Well, I've retitled it – *The Philosophy of Poker*, and I've decided that I'm going to begin releasing it chapter by chapter in this blog. The whole thing isn't finished yet, and all of the chapters that I'll be posting are rough drafts that I'll later edit when I put them together in the final version. I think releasing it this way is going to give me incentive to keep to a schedule and churn this thing out in a timely manner, and I'll hopefully be able to keep up while concurrently taking summer classes.

This is certainly a departure from the normal character of content in my blogs (and I know many of you who follow my blog have likewise departed from the poker world), but I hope you will get some value out of it, or at least enjoy it nevertheless.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kL7bMRLWa8A">[video]</div>

<div class="aside">[Note: this content is from the rough draft of my first book, *How to Be a Poker Player: The Philosophy of Poker*. If you like what you read, consider buying the [completed book](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HFDJU6A)&mdash;it's tightly edited and contains new material! Hope you enjoy. :) ]</div>

Without further ado:

## Introduction

You picked up this book because you want to improve your poker game.

I know all too well how that goes&mdash;I've been there myself. When I began poker, I was always hungry to find the little secrets the pros were using to win, believing they had to be hidden away somewhere. Within these pages, maybe you hope to find some clever ways to play hands, some sneaky bluffs that no one knows about, perhaps the secret to handling aggressive players or 3-bet pots.

So here you are. You want to learn the secrets of poker. And deep down, perhaps you hope that there is some hand, theory, or principle that will make you suddenly understand what you've been missing, some stepping stone that will lift you up into that great arena.

I know how that goes too. But with time and experience, one learns that in the end, there is no secret. There is no moment of revelation. The way is hard, rigorous, and disenchanting, as the way has ever been.

This book will not purport to teach you a shortcut to becoming good at poker. There is no shortage of books that try to teach such things. You can seek them out if you wish, but in the end you will find after you read through those books, you will be no better of a poker player than when you began. I've met and known hundreds of poker players during my time as a pro, and never have I met one whose game was transformed to a high level by reading a book. That's not the way that poker works, and it's not the way that learning happens. The aim of this book then is not to make you better at poker. But instead, it is to make you a better poker player.

What do I mean by this?

Someone once told me a long time ago, &ldquo;nobody teaches us how to be poker players.&rdquo; This is true. Certainly, we are taught strategy, how to read hands, how to size bets. But to be a poker player is more than that. Being a poker player is an isolating and confusing profession. You are immersed in one of the most backward and contradictory cultures the moment you sit down at a poker table.

I began the premise of this book with one fundamental question that I asked myself. If I could go back to 6 years ago, when I was just 16 years old, beginning my exploration into this game… what would I burn to tell him? What have I learned that he needs to know? What are the most valuable ideas that could equip him for the journey ahead? This is what I want to communicate in this book.

You will not be ready to learn all of the ideas and perspectives presented here. That's okay. I wasn't either the first time I heard them, and I heard them many times from many different people before they were ingrained in me. Chances are, it will take someone else, maybe a year or two down the road, perhaps a friend, an opponent, a stranger telling you the same thing before it finally reaches, and changes you. And who knows, some of these ideas may be wrong for you. That's okay. It's part of the process. But let this book be a step in your journey, and even if it does not change your beliefs or your perspective on the world or on poker&mdash;trust that it will help, whether you agree with it or not. Trust that it is part of the process.

Everything that I write, I write because I want you to enjoy and grow from your journey as a poker player. And I want to remind you that it is in fact a journey – anyone who treats is as less is disrespecting themselves.

What is poker to you? Is it a hobby? An interest? A passion? Is it your calling? Think carefully about this. This is where it all begins.

You are on the journey of poker. But if you are at all like me&mdash;having begun it, all you can think about is the end of that journey. You want to become great. Perhaps you even want to be the best. You see, poker is a mountain, and you are standing at its foot. You want to conquer this mountain and it becomes all you can think about. You gaze up, and you see other climbers toiling their way up its side, and all the way near the peak, you can make out the shadows of those great ones who are near to the top.

You think to yourself&mdash;oh, that I could be up there! You start climbing, scrambling, kicking and scraping your way up this treacherous mountain with your eyes fixed on the peak, because that's where you want to be in the end. Just as you play poker to become great, you climb to get to the top.

But that's not how you climb a mountain.

The only way to climb a mountain, as any climber will tell you, is by looking where *you* are. By finding a rock to reach for, another for footing, and one by one, moment by moment, to climb. To climb, and to throw yourself into climbing. Looking up or down is irrelevant.

Climbing a mountain isn't about the peak. It's about climbing. And just the very same, the journey of poker isn't about the end. It's not about becoming great. It's about the journey. It's about *poker.*

So what does that all mean?

It means look where you are. Look where your next step is. Take stock. Grab hold, steady your footing, and lift yourself up. Enjoy it. One moment, one footing at a time.

Be patient. Be gentle. Let the answers come when you're ready to receive them. But in the meantime, climb. Keep climbing, love the rock in front of you, and don't stop until you're ready to quit.

I wish you the best, and hope you will learn from what ever it is I have to teach you.

## Chapter One: The Philosophy of Poker

#### I

Let us begin with a question: *what is poker?*

You might say that poker is a card game, played between multiple players that involves cards and chips and positions and so on.

That's all well and good, but we can delve deeper than that. Consider this question instead: how would you describe poker to a Martian? That is to say, how would you describe the structure of poker? Imagine you're explaining poker to somebody who doesn't know what cards are, or what a table is&mdash;after all, those things are only symbols. You could play poker without cards, as long as you have 52 distinct entities with four groups among them, etc.

A naïve understanding of poker is going to be fixated on the things that are on the surface of the game&mdash;the numbers on the cards, the suits, the felt table, the round chips. But all of those things are incidental; they are unnecessary to the structure of poker that underlies those things. You can have a game identical to poker that uses pebbles, or even markings written down on paper, so long as you have sufficient rules. What's important is not the cards. What we want to learn is not what poker looks like, but the structure that governs what's beneath the cards.

Now, if you were to think of a metaphor for the way poker works, what metaphor would you choose?

Chances are it would be something like a chess match. Perhaps a gunfight. There are a few more common ones. (Interestingly, a lot of them seem to have to do with war, which might say a lot about the way our minds work, but perhaps that's inevitable for a competitive game.)

But let's focus on the metaphor of poker as a chess match. What does it mean to think of poker that way? Well, it seems to explain a few things. Describing poker as a chess match suggests that poker is mechanistic. It suggests that despite all the apparent randomness and luck involved, that deep down it behaves deterministically&mdash;a game of pure skill.

To take the randomness out of poker is to take the mysticism out of it. Poker is commonly assumed to be the domain of gamblers, risk-takers, the intuitively-minded and swift of heart. But when we call poker a chess match, we turn those presumptions around. Instead, poker is meant to be analyzed, theorized about, dissected into its smallest possible chunks and then re-assimilated into a whole. It becomes the game of rationalists, mathematicians, and cold strategists.

It's comforting to believe that, isn't it? It's comforting to believe that beneath all the chaos of whizzing cards and splashing chips, under all the downswings and bad beats, the tilt and the frustrations, that all the way down in the boiling heart of the thing, there is an equation or two that describes it all. That's the idea, isn't it? That if you had but the time and mathematical prowess, you could plug in some equation or execute some algorithm that would &ldquo;solve&rdquo; it all for you.

Of course, poker math is valuable. But let's think deeply about this. What is the way that you&mdash;that everyone&mdash;sees poker, at the deepest level? Consult yourself. Do you really believe that's how things work? Is learning poker the uncovering of a pristine, logical machine?

Is poker a chess match?

#### II

Perhaps you believe that, distilled to its essence, poker is a rational mathematical machine, and that belief is comforting. You would not be alone in thinking this way. Most serious students of poker who have learned advanced concepts have come to believe this, although probably not one of them has ever been told this outright. It is one of those ideas that is embedded deep in the structure of the way we talk about poker; it is unconsciously absorbed, like an element that is inhaled through the air. Nobody knows how or where, but somehow it's found its way into your mind, and it makes perfect sense. Poker is a machine. A chess match. A set of equations and matrices acting itself out, over and over again, every hand, forever&mdash;or as long as poker is played, anyway.

But the reality is that poker is not a chess match. Nor a gunfight, nor a machine, nor a battleground, nor any other such thing. In fact, poker is none of the things that you imagine it to be.

Poker simply *is.* It *is* in defiance of you, and it will always be. Through your lifetime as a poker player, poker will take many different forms for you. You will formulate it consciously or unconsciously; you will imagine new shapes, metaphors, axioms, and laws of mechanics. Things will seem to work a different way; you will find new rules and laws and equations. They will keep changing and changing. And yet, poker is always the same.

I hear you say&mdash;of course poker is the same. I know poker is the same!

Ah, but you don't! Think about it this way&mdash;first, a definition. Everybody who is a poker player has in their mind what I will call a poker **schema**. A schema can be defined simply as &ldquo;the way you think things work.&rdquo; When you are in a hand faced with a decision, or when you are trying to understand why a play or a match went right or wrong, what you consult is the set of all assumptions and intuitions you have about how poker works. Perhaps about why checkraising certain boards is bad, about what hands are too weak to valuebet, and so on&mdash;but a great deal more than that. Your schema includes all the notions you have about how the game works and what it's like. About the way matches evolve, about what it looks like to lose or win, what variance feels like. It even includes all of the language you use to describe to use poker when you're analyzing it from afar.

In short, your schema is the way you think poker works; it's your internal mental model. But this schema is not static. It's constantly changing. Every time you learn something new about the game, your schema is altered slightly. Sometimes it's added to, or sometimes tweaked in some spot or another, and so on. Of course, your schema is not always changed correctly. You sometimes mislearn things&mdash;you might learn a lesson where there is none, or where there is a lesson you might learn the wrong one. This is inevitable in a game that involves random and imperfect feedback.

So your schema is fluid. It is constantly changing and shifting, and not always in the right way. There is a chaos beneath it too.

Now, all that being said, I must concede: you are not entirely wrong to imagine poker as a chess match. There is a sense in which it is; the realest sense perhaps, but an incomplete sense nevertheless.

*Beneath* all the madness, poker is a chess match. It is logical and obeys fixed rules and mathematical constructs. *But we don't have access to that.* We don't know the chess match, and we probably never will. The only thing we have access to is how we experience poker, which is always mediated through our schema. For us, the schema *is* poker.

There is an old but poignant story that serves well here. It's said that a long time ago, there was a king who purchased a rare and exotic animal, an elephant, from a far away land. He summoned five blind men who'd never heard of this creature, and he asked each man what an elephant was. The first man grabbed the tail, and said &ldquo;an elephant is like a rope.&rdquo; The second man grabbed a leg and said &ldquo;an elephant is like a tree trunk,&rdquo; and so on, each man coming up with his idea from his limited perception. This is what a schema is. It is how our experiences and perceptions congeal into a singular idea of what the thing is. Of course an elephant is none of the things the men described, and it is even more than the sum of all their perceptions.

In a way, we are the blind men groping at the limbs of poker. We graze against it again and again, even over hundreds of thousands of hands, but our schema is all we can make of it. It's the only access we'll ever have. The utter truth is inaccessible to us; all we know is what presents itself, what we have had the luck of running our fingers over, and the picture that we've stitched together from our experiences.

What I mean more concretely is this&mdash;every time you try to formulate a match, or try to analyze a situation, you will be wrong. You might still win, make the right adjustment, even the right read, but you'll still be slightly wrong. Wrong about what, that will depend, but the fact is that reality will be shaped differently from the one that your schema describes. It has been and will always be. Since the day you started playing poker you had some schema of how the game worked, and ever since then without fail it has changed, day after day after day, and it will change again. Even the best players in the world sometimes play matches that challenge their schema of poker.

As a poker player, you doubtless want to think of yourself as a student of logic and mathematics. You imagine rationality to be the mortar with which you build your glorious fortress of poker. For this, you can be forgiven. But in your imaginations about the game, you are not wrong to say that poker is governed by mathematics and logic. But *you* are not.

Poker is played by humans. It is experienced and learned by humans. You are not a rational machine. The movements of your brain are not a chess match.

Despite all of that, however, I am not saying that mathematics and logic will get you nowhere, and I don't mean to suggest that you abandon them.

Build your fortress. You have to, even if the only materials you have are the sticks and mud around you. That's the path you've chosen, after all. Go on building. But know that your fortress will collapse, again and again. Know that your strongest and most steadfast reasoning will fall someday. That's just the way your brain works. At best, you are a creature that only approximates logic and rationality. But so it is; the building must go on.

In the end, you must erect your idol to logic and reason. You have no other choice. Cast your golden calf. The god you pray to is false, but you have no choice but to build him a monument and pray to him. After all, you must have something to destroy when you come down from the mountain&mdash;which you will. You will be your own prophet, and your own heretic, again and again.

That is the journey.

Do you agree to it? Do you want to be a poker player? Then this is your path, the only one. Live and flourish in your falsehood! Look it in the eye and love it. This is the only truth: you will be wrong, always wrong. But you must keep being wrong, and keep whittling away at that wrongness, forever. That is the path. That is the climb. That is the mountain.

#### III

It is from this point that we begin and everything originates. This turn is essential. Once you understand this, you can understand the philosophy of poker.

What does this turn tell us?

You can derive many things from it, but this is the most important fruit: it teaches us that we are fallible. Well, you might say to yourself: of course I am fallible. I know that already. Everybody's fallible.

But what I am referring to is something stronger than that. I mean more than some watered-down platitude like &ldquo;everybody makes mistakes,&rdquo; by which we imply  some occasional errors in calculation, volatility of execution, of emotion, or whatever. Those things exist, but if that's all you are looking for, you will miss the vastness of your predicament.

What I want to teach you instead is *mistrust*. Yes, mistrust. An uncommon virtue, but one you must learn. Learn to mistrust yourself. Mistrust your brain, mistrust your logic, mistrust your math, your confidence and your beliefs and your stories and your life itself. Cast doubt over it all, imbue everything with a shadow longer than the thing itself. Become the sun. The power of the sun is not in the brightness it casts, but in the shadows it reveals.

In more actionable terms&mdash;self-doubt is the most important ability for a student of poker. But self-doubt not in the sense of being timid, or wishy-washy. Those traits have no place in a poker player. What one must have is a confident self-doubt, a powerful mistrust the parts of oneself that ought not to be trusted.

You might ask: well, what parts of yourself are you supposed to mistrust?

I will get to that soon enough. But first, we must focus on the fundamentals. You cannot build a fortress until you build a foundation, after all. But in exploring this foundation, what I won't be doing is looking at the individual pieces of wood that go into building it. That is, I won't be coming up with stock hands to analyze or enumerating preflop opening frequencies. All of that is secondary, and ultimately derivative. What I will do instead is focus is on the question of *how* one constructs a poker game on the whole: what I call holistic poker theory.

Hey guys,

My summer classes have just begun. I'm taking a full load in the summer since my goal is to graduate by the end of the year, so my schedule has been really intense. Basically, I'm waking up at 7am every morning, writing in the library in the morning for a few hours on my book, going to class from 11-5PM, then coming home to eat dinner, work out, do my reading/HW for the next day, and then hitting sleep. It's been a long time since I've been this busy, but it feels good. The mental coaching is going well, and I'm really happy with the results I've been seeing my students. Once again, if you're interested, contact me at [haseebcoach at gmail dot com](mailto:haseebcoach@gmail.com).

Anyway, here's the second chapter of *The Philosophy of Poker*. It's a longer read, but my intention was to be as serious and thorough as possible, and to leave no one behind in my explanations. The next chapter will be forthcoming next week.

Bon appetit!

#### I

I began this book by implying that the reality of poker is inaccessible to us, and that we are inescapably bounded by our humanness. But that is not to suggest that it is futile to try to understand it. On the contrary, we have no other choice but to try to understand it, as best we can, using all the resources available to us. I will begin this book then by first exploring our experience of poker &ldquo;out there in the world,&rdquo; the poker as we perceive it to exist. As this book progresses, I will turn more inward, to explore the interface between the mind and poker, but it is on the outside that we must begin.

Since you are reading this book, I am going to assume a thorough acquaintance with elementary poker theory. The concepts I will discuss supervene on more basic ones, such as value, ranges, reverse implied odds, balance, game flow, game theory, and so on. If you do not have an active grounding in concepts, then I would urge you to go out and learn them first before trying to tackle this chapter.

If you want to become a great poker player, you must learn to think like one. But ideas are meaningless if you don't have the requisite experience and knowledge to talk about them. So the first step in these teachings is to equip you with the language, concepts, and perspectives with which advanced players view the game of poker.

The initial shift in perspective we must make is a philosophical one. We must start to look at poker **holistically**, rather than **reductionistically**. What this means is that we want to look at poker on the *whole*, rather than looking at it hand-by-hand, moment-to-moment. This is the analogous to thinking in terms of ranges against ranges, rather than one hand against one hand. Allow me to illustrate with an example.

There are three stages in the evolution of a player's perception of hands. The first stage is primitive and basic, and it's where we all begin&mdash;you take the hand you have, say top pair, and weigh it against his hand&mdash;or rather, what you think his hand is. You choose one hand that you &ldquo;read,&rdquo; or essentially *guess*that he has, and decide what your hand should do against it. That's the first stage, and it's how beginners think about poker. The second and more advanced level is being able to think about how your hand is doing against his entire range in a certain spot. So you might think of how your top pair is faring against his sets, his overpairs, his top pair lower kickers, and his missed straight draws, and so on; each weighted probabilistically. The number crunching is of course only approximated, but you come up with an overall equity against his hands with which you make your decision. That's the second level of perception, when you perceive *his *range. The third level of range perception is to think of how *your* range is faring against his range. This requires you not only to be able to generalize his range, but to be able to imagine and generalize your own overall strategy with all of the other possible hands you could have in this spot and how you would be playing them.

But remember, when you are beginning as a poker player, you aren't able to think in terms of more than a single hand at a time&mdash;whatever is directly in front of you is all that you're capable of perceiving. But as you gain more experience, your brain starts to handle single hands automatically. That is to say, your unconscious mind computes the single hands, and you no longer have to consciously work out things like board texture or betting patterns. Your brain tells you automatically, call, or fold, or raise, freeing up your conscious mind to deal with higher level ideas, like ranges, exploitation, game flow, and so on.

It's a common belief that it requires a great intellect or some special genius in order to be able to hold those higher-level ideas in your mind while playing. That's not the case at all. The only difference between someone who can and cannot do that is the amount of *experience* they have. Once you've played a million hands of poker, your instincts will be so honed that you will probably struggle *not* to start thinking about higher-level things, because consciously focusing on single, ordinary hands will feel like a waste of your conscious attention.

So the first step is experience. Gain experience&mdash;lots of it. And once you have enough, you have freed up the mental space to think about holistic ideas while playing. First thinking about his range, and then thinking about your range against his range. Now, this is by no means to say that experience will make you think soundly&mdash;all it does is free up the resources of your mind, but without the proper perspective that won't necessarily do you any good.

Next, we must take stock of your resources&mdash;both mental and strategic.

#### II

Now, I told you before that you should distrust metaphors, since they are never totally accurate. Of course that's true; metaphors will always fall short to describe poker perfectly, just as how every schema fails to perfectly capture reality. But that being said, I am going to be using many metaphors to describe various aspects of poker to you. These metaphors will be useful, but only in elucidating one aspect of poker. Like in the story of the elephant, each metaphor may only capture one limb of the beast&mdash;perhaps just the tail, or the tusks, or the ears. But they are useful and will lend you insight nevertheless, so I want you to consider them.

The first metaphor is one that will allow us to think about poker structurally. That is, it will allow us to think about poker &ldquo;out there,&rdquo; and for now, to simplify its interface with our minds. Consider this metaphor: poker is a ship&mdash;the kind of ship that rides on the sea. And you, the poker player, are the shipbuilder.

The first thing you'll notice is that in this metaphor, the ship is not an extension of you. It is not something internal, which exists in your mind or gut or anything like that. We want to imagine instead that poker is an external thing, an object&mdash;your object, certainly, the product of your craft and hard work&mdash;but nevertheless something that is external to you, and visible in its whole.

So the first thing we notice is that our poker game doesn't exist somewhere inside us, but instead, it exists &ldquo;out there,&rdquo; to be analyzed, taken apart, and put back together. The second thing we realize is that, as a shipbuilder, we have a lot of choices to make on how to craft our ship. What kind of poker game do we want to build?

We look out into the sea of poker players and see hundreds, if not thousands of ships, all constructed differently, with seemingly varied ideas and intentions behind their construction. Naturally we only want to choose the best ships to emulate. So we gravitate toward things like watching videos, sweating high stakes games, reading articles by great players&mdash;and we try to fashion our ships in their likeness.

But there is a fallacy embedded in this process, and that fallacy is this: no matter how many ships you look at, be it hundreds or thousands, even ships of the finest quality&mdash;no amount of looking at or studying such ships is ever going to make you able to build one of them yourself. Because looking at ships is a very different process from actually building them. And so even if you see a hundred ships which have solved the problem of how to construct a ship, how to keep it upright, how to balance the hull and the mast and the sails&mdash;no matter how many ships have accomplished this, you will still have to build your own ship which accomplishes these things. And this means you'll have to figure out *through building* how to solve these problems.

That is to say, in building your poker game, you are going to have to figure out and solve problems which other people have already solved. You must do more than merely emulate the surface of other people's games, but you have to figure out *why*their games are the way they are before you can truly build a game like theirs. There is no shortcut to the art of shipbuilding. You must learn the art yourself.

Now, another aspect of this metaphor is that as a shipbuilder, you have limited resources. In fact, everyone has the very same amount of limited resources. That is to say, you have the exact same resources available to you as the best player in the world.

#### III

Imagine that at the moment you step into the poker world, you are handed a stack of wood. You are told, &ldquo;Here you go. This is all the wood you get. This is all the wood you will ever get. Using this wood, you have to build the best ship you can. Good luck.&rdquo;

You might interject&mdash;but that's silly! You don't have the assets that the best players in the world have. They have all that speed, intuition, or reading abilities that you don't.

But remember! In this metaphor, you are not your ship. Your ship is external to you, and you are merely the builder. Follow me for a moment. We all get the same stack of wood&mdash;and that stack of wood is the set of all hands. We all get dealt the same hands, with the exact same frequency, and over a long enough period of time, both we and the best players in the world will get aces and kings and T9s the very same number of times. The only difference is what we *do*with those hands&mdash;that is, how we use those hands to build the structure of our poker game.

Your limited resources then, are good hands. Everybody gets the exact same good hands the same frequency of times. The decision is chiefly yours how you want to distribute those good hands over your flops, turns, rivers, among your flatcalls and raises and slowplays, between your small bets and overbets, etc. This is how you construct the structure of your game.

Now, when it comes to exploitation, that's where poker comes to life. **Exploitation** is taking advantage of weaknesses in your opponents' ships. But you cannot exploit someone without becoming exploitable yourself. It is like throwing a punch&mdash;in order to punch someone, you have to lower your guard. And of course, you can't win a fight by guarding forever. We might imagine something like installing cannons on this ship&mdash;in order to install a cannon, you must necessarily create a hole in your ship to fire from.  And of course, that hole can also be more easily fired into. By attacking, you open yourself to weakness. This is the nature of attack and defense in all things.

So we all get hands, and we must each make decisions as to where to allocate these hands in order to create the defensive structure of our games. This is the fundament of our ship, which we want to be unassailable, fortified in every direction, such that no simple strategy can hurt us (or, more likely, that the average strategy won't hurt us). And from this point, we start opening ourselves up&mdash;creating openings from which we can attack depending on the ship we're up against, and by process of which we open up our weaknesses.

To mix metaphors a little&mdash;once you enter into a poker match, you are faced with a decision on how best to utilize your wood (that is, your good hands). Do you choose to use your wood to strengthen your fortress, or are you going to go out and use that wood as a battering ram? Ultimately you must do either one or the other. And we might describe the best players as being able to best use the wood they have to either optimally reinforce their fort, or to optimally use as battering rams. All wood is created equal, but not all wood is used equally.

#### IV

I have been very philosophically minded in many of my explanations thus far. But I don't want to leave you only with ideas. I want you to think about how to put these things into practice as well. Of course, there's a sense in which all I can really teach you is ideas. But I can also point you toward the path to putting these ideas into effect.

When you conceive of a real poker match&mdash;and for the purpose of simplicity, let's imagine it's a match against only one opponent&mdash;how do we put these ideas into practice? How does this perspective demand that we think, and where does it come into play?

This is a difficult question of course. And it's difficult for a few reasons. For one, it's likely that you don't actually know that much about *how* you think about poker. People in general tend to know very little about the processes of their own cognition, although they are often inclined to think that they do. That's a cognitive fallacy that we'll look more into later. But the second reason why it is a tough question is that it *is *genuinely difficult to put the aforementioned kind of perspective into practice. But let's at least try to see what it looks like.

Imagine you're in a spot, say on the flop or turn. You have a hand&mdash;but it doesn't actually matter what you have, because in this kind of thinking your hand doesn't actually matter. Remember, what we're thinking about is your range (in other words, the entirety of your handrange and overall strategy). So the central question is this: how do we want to arrange our ranges so that we're best exploiting what we think his range is?

The question is easier to pronounce than it is to follow its thread to the end. But there are a constellation of things that it forces us to consider: first, what weaknesses in our opponent's game can we exploit? Where is he allocating his good hands? Where are his good hands missing? Inherently, this question requires you to integrate all of the information you have about this opponent, through which we can narrow down his hand ranges eliminatively, and it also includes your psychological profile of your opponent, as well as general patterns you've noticed in how he plays his good hands.

Remember, the art of building a ship is the art of allocating good hands. This means that we want to be following his good hands as closely as we can, paying the utmost of attention to them&mdash;because in fact, everybody gets dealt the same amount of them. We must trace his good hands with our eyes, as though they are magnets moving through a field of iron shavings, imprinting the skeleton of his game&mdash;that is, his good hands will show us where his game is strong and fortified. Wherever he is extending himself away from that skeleton, that is where we know he is weak, and that's where we want to be attacking.

For example, if somebody is using all of his good hands on the flop by checkraising them and playing them fast, and in this hand he hasn't done so&mdash;then you know here on the turn you should be battering him, because his structure is inherently weak here. You therefore want to construct your ranges so that you're attacking him in this spot, and losing as little as possible in situations when he's checkraised you.

It's a simple example of course, but it gives you the idea of this sort of holistic top-down view of the game. There's probably a good chance that you find all of these conclusions pretty intuitive. In a way, my project begins with telling you what you already know. But in understanding it in this different way, using more precise language, you may gain clarity and insight that you may not have had before, and we may use that language to build toward bigger and more complex ideas.

#### V

Next we are going to look at a more advanced concept in poker. Note the following diagram.

![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aXB6gLdLdg4/T9MDy50gofI/AAAAAAAABQ8/NwZmE3OCyJo/s1600/central.png)

Imagine this rectangle is a map of poker. This rectangle represents the field of possibilities, and every point on this rectangle represents one possible sequence for a poker hand that can take place.

The circle in the middle represents 99% of all poker hands. Yet, you will notice that the circle doesn't cover 99% of the rectangle. This is because the circle represents not 99% of all the possibilities, but 99% of possibilities by **frequency**. That is to say, if we were to enumerate all possible hands that can be played in poker, the range would be astronomically large. But if we were to enumerate 99% of the most commonly played hands or types of hands, they would be relatively easy to contain. This is partly because so many hands end on early streets and are therefore less complex, but also because most hands are not very exceptional and essentially play themselves&mdash;by either c-betting, or flopping a hand so good or so bad that your decision is simple.

So we can think of this as a probabilistic map, shaded so that the places of highest frequency are darker, and the lowest frequency is lighter. You will notice a thin veil of light-grey encompassing the rest of the map. This is because the remainder of the field of possibilities is very rare, comes up uncommonly, and is randomly distributed outside of the normal field. For the most part, most things that happen fall within the 99% circle.

This is a concept which I call **centrality**. Centrality is the measure of how close to the center of the probabilistic map a certain situation or hand is. Or, even more simply, centrality is how common a certain spot is. A spot that is highly central would be something like 3-betting light preflop&mdash;it is a decision that is made a great many times a session, which makes it very central. A spot that is very non-central would be something like 3-bet bluff-shoving the river to represent a rivered runner runner straight. It's a situation that probably doesn't even arise once every two thousand hands, and so it's tremendously rare and non-central.

Now, what important differences are there between central and non-central spots?

For one, any spot that is highly central is going to be easier than one that is non-central. If the spot is central, then it is one that most players have been exposed to so many times that they understand the dynamics of that spot fairly well. Therefore, most players play pretty well in spots that are highly central. On the other hand, in spots that are non-central, people are more likely to make mistakes, since they inherently don't have as much experience in non-central spots.

A corollary of this, which is an important principle of poker, is this: people will only be good at what they need to be good at. You can think of this as a kind of natural selection within poker: an evolutionary principle. It means simply that if your opponent has never had to be good at doing a certain thing, then he won't be. People only develop the skills they need, and generally speaking, nothing more. This is a simple point perhaps, but an important one.

To bring it back to centrality&mdash;any spot that is highly central is a spot where there's less room for you to exploit your opponent, because your opponent is naturally going to have a more robust strategy. This is simply because your opponent has, just like you, faced this spot so many times that he has had to have a good strategy in order to survive until now (again, the evolutionary principle). For example, five years ago, 3-betting light was an enormously powerful strategy, because it was a very non-central; few people had experience against it and knew how to deal with it. Poker players literally did not need to be able to deal with light 3-bettors, and so they weren't good at it. But by now, five years later, 3-betting light is so common as to be trivial, and everybody has dealt with it so much that they've arrived at near-optimal strategies. The truth is, preflop game is pretty simple. Since it limits poker to only the first street, which is inherently the simplest, it leaves the least room for complexity, and therefore the least room for maneuvering, mistakes, and exploitation. You are not likely to be making much money in preflop game, because it's highly central and everybody is pretty good at it by now.

So there are two major implications that follow from this. The first is that if our poker match stays within the circle of centrality, we will diminish our chances to exploit our opponent, since we are inviting him into a space where he's very comfortable, and naturally has a robust strategy. But by leading him intentionally out of the circle of centrality&mdash;by taking him into a terrain with which he's unfamiliar, we allow the possibility for bigger mistakes. This is why players who have very unconventional styles, even ones which sometimes seem distinctly suboptimal, are sometimes dramatically winning players. Part of the reason why they might continue to be successful is because they jostle their opponents out of their circle of centrality, while still remaining in their own circle of centrality.

Imagine the stories of Native Americans fighting cowboys in the forests&mdash;the Native Americans might have be pitting mere bows and arrows against the much more deadly guns, but the fact is that by fighting on terrain they know and their opponents don't know, they were creating many more opportunities for their opponents to make mistakes which they themselves wouldn't make. In fact, not only were they less likely to make mistakes themselves, but because they had experience fighting against people who weren't experienced on their terrain, they were good at predicting *what kind* of mistakes their opponents would commonly make.

Even in poker, it is not uncommon to play against someone who has such a peculiar strategy that you immediately assume that they are a fish. You might, after some time, realize that they're actually fairly intelligent postflop, and you may even discover that you're having trouble beating him.

These phenomena are essentially the same. To beat somebody with a very unconventional or non-central style of play, one powerful strategy is to explore *his* forest of centrality, acquaint yourself with the terrain, even if you make some missteps along the way. Once you learn the landscape of his style, your inherently more powerful gun will defeat his inferior bow and arrow, but you can only get to that point if you have the patience and foresight to understand that process, and not let yourself get frustrated and make needless mistakes along the way.

You may notice, however, that this strategy is somewhat passive. It simply acquiesces to the space of our opponent's choice and tries to optimize within that space. That is in fact only one mode of dealing with centrality. We will call that mode the **reactive** mode, which simply tries to adapt to the space your opponent has pushed you into. Most &ldquo;grinders&rdquo; tend to play this way. But the second mode is the **proactive** mode, which actively moves around and tries to search for non-central spaces in which to challenge its opponents. Poker players who prefer this mode tend to be more aggressive, risky, and creative players. I will explore some of these ideas in more detail later in the chapter on creativity and fear.

It is important to remember, however, that centrality is relative. What is central to one player may not be central to another. Centrality is defined by probabilistic frequency, so if two players have vastly different styles, then chances are, what is frequent in one player's game will be infrequent in another's. For example, if one player minraises preflop and always tries to play small pot poker, and another player is used to 3xing and doing lots of overbetting postflop, it is likely that each of them will be pushing the other into non-central spaces.

Centrality is also contingent on complexity and other player-dependent factors. For example, cold 4-betting when an aggressive button 3-bets may be a relatively central play in a 6-max game. Because it is central, we can assume that people can deal with it and will respond relatively well on average. But if instead you cold 4-bet when a less predictable bad player 3-bets, that may be a non-central play, and it's something that other players might be unsure exactly how to interpret. Complexity and rarity tend towards non-centrality.

The second aspect of centrality is a psychological one. Remember before that I claimed spots within the circle of centrality are easy. But what exactly does it mean for a spot to be &ldquo;easy&rdquo;?

This is actually a tougher question than it sounds, which I will go into more detail about later. But for now we will say that &ldquo;easy&rdquo; hands are ones that don't require a lot of psychological processing in order to make a decision. That is to say, they are mostly automatic and subconscious.

A spot that is highly central is one that's easy, which means your opponent will be processing it mostly unconsciously. This means *he won't be paying much attention* to highly central spots. He knows he's solving them with relatively high efficiency, so he'll be focusing his conscious attention elsewhere. Non-central spots on the other hand will have the opposite effect. Once your opponent runs into a non-central spot, he'll be shaken back into conscious awareness. His autopilot will turn itself off, so to speak, and he'll retake his place at the cockpit to make this decision.

This has an important implication for us in the psychological game. Knowing where your opponent is paying his conscious attention is vital. If you can tell where your opponent is paying attention and where he's not (strategic and speed-reads come in handy here), you can better predict his reactions. In central spots we can assume your opponent is going to be cognitively autopiloting, and your general read on his style and character will be applicable. I.e., if he's somebody who does too much of *x* or tends to do *y*, you can fully expect this behavior to present in a central spot. But once a non-central spot arises, your opponent is going to change psychologically.

If you think about it in another way, his autopilot is essentially a pre-calculated program. It's a set of algorithms that have been formulated by his past and all of the conditioning that he's been through, and he trusts it when it applies. But once he reaches a new spot where he has to focus his attention, he's going to re-integrate and re-invent a solution to the new spot he's facing as though he's never faced it before, using his poker theory and reasoning. But this *only*happens when he has focused his conscious attention on this new hand. What all this means is that your opponent is likely to deviate from his normal psychological and strategic character in a non-central spot, and is instead going to be acting on a new theoretical analysis, based on nearby available psychological and strategic data in his match with you.

Central and non-central spots are *processed differently*, and understanding this will allow you to predict what would otherwise appear to be psychological anomalies.

Let me illustrate with an example. Let's imagine you're playing a match against a thinking opponent, but someone who is generally somewhat of a calling station and doesn't like to fold. So far, every time you've shown down in a big pot, you've had a good hand. What we can say is that generally speaking, he will probably retain his style of being a calling station and playing the same way he usually plays in central spots, because that's his automatic game. But once you move into a non-central space, suddenly he will be jostled awake. You might make a big bet to the river, and you can predict that at this moment he will be *forced*to re-think over this hand. If you are attentive, you will notice all of the nearby information that he'll be integrating&mdash;that you've only shown down good hands&mdash;and you can predict he will think to himself &ldquo;oh, this guy always has it,&rdquo; and make a big fold.

That fold might appear to be uncharacteristic and unpredictable by someone who doesn't understand this concept, but good players are able to predict this sort of thing accurately. They may not use these words (or even be able to articulate the process behind it), but this is what they are doing. By being aware of the difference between the automatic and subconscious decision-making in central spots, and the explicit and deliberate thought that goes into non-central spots, you'll be able to predict otherwise unpredictable moves. That is the power of centrality.

As a final caveat, it's important to keep in mind that centrality is, at best, a principle to keep in mind. The adjustment game hinges on a lot more things than the concept of centrality, and a strategy that literally only consists of trying to push people into non-central spaces would probably be what most people call maniacal. Rather, centrality is simply a way of understanding some of the dynamics that underlie adjustments, aggression, and comfort, which are all important elements of the adjustment game.

#### VI

With centrality, we have already breached well into the realm of holistic poker thinking. The landscape of holistic poker theory is populated by many familiar big ideas, such as balance, exploitation, game theory, and so on. But to really be able to examine and manipulate these concepts, we have to understand them deeply. One of the biggest concepts that intermediate players tend to misunderstand is the concept of balance, so I will explore it in depth.

Let's pose the initial question. What is **balance**?

We might start by saying that it's basically the idea that you need to balance your bets with both bluffs with value hands. That's not a bad start, but it turns out there's a lot more to balance than that.

The truth is, the word &ldquo;balance&rdquo; as it is used in poker discourse is something of a fuzzy concept, which people often use to fill holes in their poker thinking. If you ask somebody &ldquo;why are you checking back a set here?&rdquo; or &ldquo;why are you betting middle pair?&rdquo; or &ldquo;why are you bluffing this river?&rdquo; many times the confused mid-stakes player will answer that it's for &ldquo;balance.&rdquo; But if you press him on a definition, he won't be able to tell you exactly what that means. It's strange, given how liberally the word is thrown around, but for our purposes it is essential that we dissect this concept.

Balance is by its nature somewhat fuzzy, but the way it's used, it boils down to two basic ideas. The first idea is that in order for a range to be balanced, it must contain both value hands and bluffs. The second is that in order for a range to be balanced, it must contain both nutty and medium strength hands. It is said then if you have too much of one and not enough of the other, that you are imbalanced in that spot.

Now, let's look carefully at this definition. What exactly does it mean to say that a range must contain both value hands and bluffs? How many of them? Is one bluff per 100 hands enough? It's here that the concept of balance gets tied in with the notion of **unexploitable** play. Unexploitability is a concept from game theory, which simply means that our strategy cannot be exploited by any other&mdash;that is, it can never lose to any other strategy. For example, if we take the game rock-paper-scissors, the unexploitable (also called **GTO**, game theory optimal) strategy is to randomly play each move exactly 33% of the time. This makes it so that no matter what your opponent plays, he will on average be breaking even against you.

Many poker players end up equating balance with unexploitable play. By this what I mean is that they think in order to be balanced, their range must be completely unexploitable, or what we might call &ldquo;perfectly balanced.&rdquo; This would mean something along the lines of intentionally creating a range where you're bluffing 33% of the time and valuebetting 66% of the time when you pot the river when a draw misses (which would make your opponent's EV for calling a bluff-catcher exactly 0).

On its face, these concepts all sound grand and attractive enough and it certainly makes us want to think they're going to solve our problems. But there are two great fallacies in most people's understanding of balance. The first fallacy is the assumption that balance is all-or-nothing. That is, that you're either &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; or &ldquo;not balanced.&rdquo; The second fallacy is thinking that balance is inherently valuable, when in fact, it isn't.

Let us begin with the first. Balance is not all-or-nothing. That is to say, your ranges don't need to contain an unexploitable proportion of value hands and bluffs in them, and nor do they need an unexploitable amount of nutty hands in them. The reason why this is the case is because of **imperfect information**. In a real poker game, your opponents are going to get information about the actual hands that comprise your range very, very slowly. Think about it&mdash;your opponent only sees one hand per showdown, and most hands are never shown down in poker, not to mention a hand that shows him exactly what's going on with that part of your range&mdash;it may be hundreds of hands until he sees another hand of a relevant situation. So because information is gleaned so slowly for highly specific ranges, there are a lot of your ranges which for any given match will remain totally hidden, which means you can essentially do whatever you want until your opponent catches on and adjusts correctly.

But there is more to it than that. Information in poker is not only imperfect, but it is also imperfectly wielded and responded to. For example, even if your opponent starts catching onto you in a bluffing spot, you don't need to show that you have &ldquo;enough&rdquo; nutty hands in any given range to get him to respect you again. All you need to do is have some, even a small amount. What I mean by this is that if your opponent suddenly sees you show down the nuts in an uncommon spot where you'd been bluffy before, he's not going to attack that part of your range anymore because he's likely to assume that you've enacted a large-scale adjustment, overgeneralizing from your most salient plays. Instead of thinking &ldquo;okay, I've only seen the nuts once and 8 bluffs, which makes his range 89% bluffs,&rdquo; he is likely instead to think that you've decided to completely change your strategy, and will react accordingly. The amount of subsequent hands it'll need to convince him that you don't have *enough* nutty hands in that range to be unexploitable is going to be quite large, because of the fuzziness of information and how slowly he'll be acquiring it. Not to mention the fact that salient impressions (especially initial ones) are psychologically more persuasive and impressive than slowly accrued data.

So if you think about it carefully, given how slowly your opponent will be gathering information about most spots, he won't be able to ascertain your true frequencies very precisely. If he sees a spot four times in 500 hands, and one time you had a bluff and three times you were valuebetting, you might make the assumption that your opponent would assume that you have a 25% bluffing range. But think about it&mdash;if you see a coin flipped 4 times and you get 3 heads and 1 tails, do you automatically assume the coin is rigged?

Poker players will often try to balance their ranges, and because of that, forego playing exploitatively. This is symptomatic of a cognitive fallacy that is more widespread, which is one of the biggest mistakes that a poker player can make. It is what I call the **fallacy of omniscience**. The fallacy of omniscience is when you assume that your opponent knows everything you know, or sees everything you see.

Let's take for example a highly non-central spot. Say we're in a spot where we're considering 3-bet bluffing somebody on the river to represent a runner-runner straight. Now, you might be sitting there, thinking over this bluff, and you might think to yourself that in fact, you never would have a straight here in this spot because you would have check/raised the river, or you would have done something else with it on the turn, or whatever. And so you think to yourself, it's irrational here to bluff because this isn't how you would play your actual hand. This is an instance of the fallacy of omniscience, because you're assuming that your opponent knows everything that* you know* about your own game. The fact is, *even if he has seen all of those things*, he may not assume that you always play your backdoor straights that way. He might not have even had the chance to see those things about your game yet. Or he may not have even noticed them even if he saw them. He may have even seen them but forgotten them. There are many stages of the transmittance of information in between what you know and what he knows, and a failure to navigate and consider those channels of information is a very big mistake that's going to cause you to forego a lot of valuable bluffing spots.

Now, there are obvious exceptions to this rule where truly unexploitable or &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; balance is important. This would be in spots where information acquisition is relatively quick. That is, in highly central spots, such as in preflop 3-betting games, where information is gathered very quickly and accurately. You won't be able to get away with 3-betting purely junk hands for long at an average 6-handed table because your opponents will note and respond to your tendencies very fluidly. But the further down a rabbit hole of a poker hand you go, and the less central the spot becomes, the more information becomes slow to come in and difficult to respond to, and the more other psychological elements can protect you from being spotted and exploited

So all this is well and good, but it leaves one important question un-answered. The question is this: why is balance important?

#### VII 

The word &ldquo;balance&rdquo; is a relatively recent arrival in the vocabulary of the average poker player. It wasn't that long ago that balance was simply not talked about. But imported along with the concept of balance, there is a certain presumption that has found its way into many people's poker thinking. The presumption is this: that balance is inherently valuable, and desirable. That is, that it's better to be balanced than imbalanced.

I suspect that this presumption is derived in part from the association between being imbalanced and being exploitable. Being **exploitable** is not the same thing as being exploited. Remember when I said that in order to attack, you must create a hole in your defense? This is true in poker, as in everything else. In order to be exploiting somebody, it must be possible for your strategy to be exploited as well.

For example, say your opponent is bluffing far too little in a certain spot. In order to exploit his strategy, you never hero-call, since he almost always has it. This occurs to you as the natural adjustment of course, but in terms of game theory, you are becoming exploitable in order to exploit him. If you are now folding 100% of your bluff-catchers, then you are inherently making it possible for him to exploit you by simply bluffing 100% of the time. Of course, that sort of thing doesn't happen in a match, which is why you're okay with doing it. But the point is that there's nothing *bad* about being exploitable. One must be exploitable in order to be playing well and adjusting to one's opponent.

So let's return to the original presumption. The idea that balance is inherently valuable is tricky, and we want to be careful about it, because it relates very closely to the notions of exploitability and unexploitability. To be **unexploitable** means that it's impossible for our opponent to take advantage of us&mdash;meaning simply that it doesn't matter what strategy he takes, our EV will be the same. Recall the rock-paper-scissors strategy of randomly throwing 33% of each. In essence, it makes a part of our game unassailable. Metaphorically speaking, you can imagine that playing unexploitably is like boarding up a part of your ship so that it will be impossible to attack it. But by the same token, you are no longer able to attack from there either. There is nothing going in or out. By playing unexploitably in a certain spot, you are not necessarily improving the strength of your game, but simply excluding it from the battlefield and making the scope of the game smaller.

Now, you are probably well acquainted with the term **optimal**, but optimality has a very specific meaning in terms of game theory. To be optimal means to be maximally exploiting your opponent (or in other words, to maximize your own EV). To play optimally necessarily means *not* to play unexploitably, since you cannot exploit someone without being exploitable yourself. Therefore, in a vacuum, to play unexploitably against a human opponent is to choose a suboptimal strategy.

Now, you might wonder&mdash;if it is literally never optimal to be playing unexploitably and perfectly balanced… why do people think you should? Why is balance so important if it's never optimal?

Well, here is the rub. If your opponent is playing unexploitably and perfectly balanced, then by definition, your strategy doesn't matter (so long as you're not doing something dumb like open-folding), because your EV will be the same regardless of what action you take. So you could just do anything you want as long as you were getting to showdowns, and your EV would be the same. However, intuitively that doesn't seem right, does it?

The reason why that doesn't seem right is because poker is not played in a vacuum. Poker is played *over time*. Instead of looking at poker **synchronically**, or at one moment in time, instead we want to look at poker **diachronically**, or over a period of time. So for a single hand, it's true that if our opponent is playing unexploitably such that our EV for each hero-call is 0, that it's fine to never hero-call him, or to hero-call him 100% of the time. Mathematically that's true, since 0 multiplied by anything is still 0. However, that doesn't take into account the change of the match over time. Once we start hero-calling our opponent 100% of the time, our opponent is likely to see that, and react to that information by deviating from his unexploitable strategy into an exploitative one, such that he stops bluffing altogether. This would make our EV dramatically negative and his positive. If you think about it, his unexploitability&mdash;his balancedness&mdash;has created for him a stronghold from which he can choose how and when to attack, how and when to open up his portcullis of exploitability, as he gains information.

What that really means is that balance and unexploitability is a **defensive** strategy. It is, in a sense, a way of safely biding your time.

Another reason why unexploitability is a valuable defensive strategy is because of the fact that humans have limited attention. There is a common and widespread psychological fallacy that people commonly commit, poker players not omitted. They often assume that because something is presented in front of them, that they will always react appropriately to it. Ironically, when looking at other people, you will often factor into your assumptions the chance that they miss or incorrectly evaluate information, but you rarely consider this about yourself.

The fact is, over a poker match, you are faced with innumerably many frequencies and patterns in your interactions with one opponent. You are faced with his preflop raising ranges, his 3-betting frequency, his flop c-betting percentage, the different ranges of hands with which he c-bets and checks back, the frequency with which he checks monster hands, the ranges that accord to different flop betsizes, and so on. The reality is, although all of these things are there to be perceived, you don't immediately perceive all of them. Your attention is limited. There are only certain things that you can actually focus on and play the adjustment game around, and the rest you just throw away, so to speak. Even the certain things you've chosen to focus on, you don't react to perfectly all the time.

If you imagine the ship analogy, it would be silly to open up holes all around your ship, even if you had a cannon for each of them. This is for the simple reason that you can only focus on so many of your own cannons, and you can only watch over so many openings at once. You are, in the end, the only crew member on this ship. So you must plan around that! Keep your ship fortified where your attention cannot reach, and in the places that your attention is active and continual, that's where you want to be playing exploitably and opening yourself up to attack. So because of the fact that *your own attention is limited*, it is a valuable defensive strategy to try to play unexploitably.

Now, I've given you all these reasons as to why balance is a good thing, and it clearly is. And yet, I told you that it's wrong to presume that balance is always desirable.

Let's think about this carefully. If balance is good, and clearly it often is, then it must contribute EV to our game. So let's try to pinpoint exactly where that EV comes from.

Imagine a spot where you're the preflop raiser, and you flop trips. You decide to check the turn because you want to balance your bet/check/bet line, instead of bet/bet/betting. Where does the EV of your balancing actually come from?

You might guess: &ldquo;well, if you're against an opponent who's really floaty and likes to checkraise rivers in spots like this when you're going for thin value, then you can induce a lot of bluffs here.&rdquo;

But be careful&mdash;that's not balance, that's inducing a bluff. While it's true that many spots where you might rearrange your ranges for balancing may induce bluffs, and may even be as a consequence the optimal play, that has nothing to do with balance. Let's imagine that we worked out this opponent's tendencies, and calculated that he's somebody against whom bet/bet/bet would be slightly more +EV on average than bet/check/bet in this hand. So mathematically, if balancing is superior, it must give us some other EV external to this hand. Where is that EV supposed to come from?

The answer is that the EV for balancing is realized not synchronically, but diachronically. That is, it's not realized over one hand, but it's realized over an entire match. Think about it. If taking a bet/check/bet line here allows you in the future to be able to bet for value a thinner range on the river, since your bet/check/bet line is balanced by having trips, then your opponent is going to checkraise bluff you less. Not only does it let you valuebet thinly more effectively, but it allows you to bluff effectively with the bet/check/bet line.

You might notice that capturing this EV is contingent on the situation popping up again before the match ends. Because the EV of balancing is realized diachronically, balancing only has value over the course of a longer match. If you are playing somebody for 10 hands, chances are balancing is going to be worthless unless it's synchronically optimal. There's a second factor as well&mdash;if your opponent isn't aware of the fact that you're balancing, then your balance isn't netting you any EV. That is, if your opponent isn't observant or aware enough to notice that you've included trips in your bet/check/bet line, then you're not going to get any EV in future hands from it. Against somebody who is essentially unaware of what is going on, you are better off playing each hand optimally synchronically. So balance is only valuable in and of itself against people who are aware enough to perceive and respond to your balance, and who you'll be playing for long enough for it to matter.

We can see that there are certain times when balance isn't very valuable, and certain times when it is more valuable. It falls along a spectrum; balancing isn't always preferable to not balancing.

So to sum all this up, we can state final theorem of balance: one should balance *if and only if* the EV of balancing averaged over the session (diachronic) is greater than the EV you gain by playing the hand optimally in a vacuum (synchronic). Of course, sometimes playing the hand balanced is also playing the hand optimally, as in the case of a bet/check/bet line against somebody who'll bluff the river a lot. But in cases where the way to optimally play the hand is not to balance, you must consider your EV carefully.

#### VIII

Balance, however, isn't limited to distributing hands among different actions (as in between betting and checking). There is also balance in bet sizing. Most people tend to think of this as a separate arena for balancing.

If you consider balancing bet sizes a separate game, you're likely to find the task overwhelmingly daunting. But in fact, we can simplify matters. What does it mean to balance bet sizes after all? It simply means that each individual bet size needs to be balanced independently&mdash;that is, it just means you have to treat each bet size as its own range. If you only have one bet size in a certain spot, that may present itself as an easy task, but there are many spots in which you'll have more than one &ldquo;go-to&rdquo; or predetermined bet size&mdash;though none of us is ever going to use *every possible* bet size. In any given spot, generally you will have two or three predetermined bet sizes, but rarely any more than that. If we simply imagine a bet size as simply being a *different action* from another bet size, then we can extend the previous line of argument to come at a theory of balancing in bet sizing.

Here's an example. Imagine that you 3-bet your opponent preflop and he calls, the board runs out KsQs5d3d7h and you barrel every street. You may have three different bet sizes on the river: three fourths pot, which is your standard and includes top pair for value; an overbet which includes nutty hands for value like twopairs and sets; and a smaller bet that includes only AQ-QT value. Other than those value hands, those ranges would be populated solely with bluffs, and each with a different proportion relative to the whole. We could decide to achieve perfect balance in each range by doing some simple math with the pot sizes, and achieve a mix of bluffs and value that would be unexploitable for each range. But is that really what we want to do?

We are faced with the challenge of balancing over three ranges instead of one. How do we decide how to balance this?

First, let's remember the fundamental theorem of balance. You should use a hand to balance a bet size *if and only if* the EV of the effect that hand has on your bet size averaged over the session is greater than the EV you gain by sizing that hand optimally in a vacuum.

Keep in mind, in order for bet size balancing to be useful, you must ascertain what your opponent is paying attention to. If he is simply ignorant, inattentive, holding onto presumptions (or not gathering any information by folding every time), then there is little need to balance, because your balance won't be affecting his future behavior. There are obvious examples, such as when you're playing a super-fish, but there are also more subtle ones. There are some good opponents who will never call 1/3 pot sized bets on certain rivers because they assume you're always going for thin value, and some opponents who will never call overbets on certain run-outs. Because your opponent is getting almost no access to that information, and because he's likely to cling onto his presumptions about how people play those spots without paying attention to your actual style, you are often free to play utterly exploitatively in those spots. But in spots that are highly visible (and in matches of sufficient length), balancing bet sizes becomes more important.

But ultimately there is another level of complexity to choosing bet sizes. Balancing between betting and checking is a simple binary decision. But how do you decide *how much* to bet?

This is another question of holistic thinking. We'll start with an example. We're 100bb deep, we 3-bet our opponent preflop, he calls, and flop comes out A23r; the pot is 20bbs. For simplicity, let's say that in this case we're only going to choose one bet size for our entire range. We could choose 5bbs, 10bbs, or 15bbs. How do we make that decision?

In this case, it is by pondering this question: what does this sizing allow us to do with our *entire* range? Remember, at any given time on this board we might have KK or AQo or 79dd, and in each case our natural inclination will probably be to choose the best bet size for that specific hand. But in order to balance effectively, we must think holistically. Instead of thinking about what's the best bet size for our hand, we must think: what is the best bet size for my *average *hand? In other words, how much work does the bet do over all the hands I'll have here, rather than just the hand I have here now?

In this specific case, the answer is usually going to be close to 5bbs, since it's a WAWB (way-ahead/way-behind) type board, whereas on a much drawier board on which your opponent is more likely to have significant equity you would bet bigger and less often with your entire range. But this can depend on a constellation of things, most importantly, how foldy your opponent is to different bet sizes, which is something you should always be probing and experimenting with.

This leads us to the last big idea, which is the art of bluffing.

#### IX

Bluffing is something that every poker player thinks they know how to do. But there are subtle aspects to bluffing that are not understood by many players.

The first concept of note is **bluffing equity**, which is the equity you get from being able to bluff on a later street. If you imagine somebody who's dealt two napkins&mdash;that is, who literally has cards that can never connect with the board, that person can still win pots, and possibly even beat some really bad opponents. All of that person's equity is coming from his bluffing equity, or his ability to win pots with bluffs.

Bluffing equity is important to consider, because sometimes bluffing equity is a valuable reason to stay in a pot rather than fold out early. Many poker players never think about this, but a negative EV decision on an earlier street may become positive EV from profitable bluffing situations that may appear later on in a hand. It's actually analogous the concept of implied odds. According to implied odds, a negative EV decision on this street may become profitable by the likelihood of making money on the next street. Bluffing equity is the same&mdash;you may continue in a hand that's slightly negative EV because a good bluffing opportunity may appear on the next street. Of course, people are much less comfortable using this justification for a play, because they feel really sure about the positive EV of being able to hit a straight or trips, but the positive EV of a bluffing spot doesn't *feel* as solid to them. They're more afraid of having to rely on it. But really, EV from value hands and EV from bluffs are the same&mdash;EV is EV.

But there is an important caveat here. In order to use bluffing equity as a justification for a play, you have to be sure that the bluff you plan to do is going to actually work, i.e., you have to hand-read really well and know how your opponent thinks. Therefore, if you're a confident in your reads, then your true bluffing EV is going to be closer to your projected bluffing EV, but if you're not confident in your reads then your actual bluffing EV might not be close at all to what you projected it to be.

So for a confident player it might be a good idea to rely on bluffing equity, but if you're less confident player then you should be more careful of using bluffing equity as a justification for immediately –EV plays.

Ironically, people rarely if ever consider this when it comes to implied odds. People will chase sets and draws, under the unexamined presumption that if they hit it their opponent will pay them off. But in reality, many players never acknowledge the fact that their opponent rarely pays them off when they do hit, often because their own bet sizing or nittiness is tipping their opponents off. This is a **vestigial habit** from early on in a player's career. That is, it is a left-over behavior that many players learn when playing low stakes (how to set-mine and try to hit draws, fully expecting to get paid off) that doesn't get adequately extinguished once they move up to tougher games. Given how poorly the brain intuitively responds to probabilities (that is, the brain is very bad at getting subconsciously conditioned by odds of ¼ or smaller), it is no surprise that this vestigial habit would transform into such a widespread mistake among poker players. I will be talking about vestigial habits in more detail later. But in summary, these players would do well to incorporate more use of bluffing equity in their game. Cases like these actually show how fundamentally similar bluffing equity and implied odds really are.

Just as how implied odds can actually become reverse implied odds, the chance of making a hand we can't get away from that loses us even more money, we can have **reverse bluffing equity**. Say for example that we're staying in a hand with a nut blocker, planning to bluff hard if the flush draw hits, because we believe he'd never play a draw of his own the way he has. Well, in the instance that he actually decided to play his own draw softer than we expected, we are setting ourselves up to lose even more money if the cards we're planning to bluff on hit. In short, you should always be taking stock of how accurate your reads are, and the less accurate they seem to be, the less you should be veering from immediately profitable plays.

Now, there couple of basic principles of bluffing that are not very well understood by most people, so I want to discuss them briefly. The first I'll pose as a question&mdash;when you want to bluff someone, what kind of hand do you want to represent?

Most people will intuitively answer &ldquo;a strong hand.&rdquo; This is exactly the wrong answer. If you think about it, your opponent doesn't actually care whether or not your hand is strong. What he cares about is whether or not his hand can beat yours. That is to say, you need to represent a hand that's *better than his*. So if he has a mediocre hand, you don't need to represent a strong hand. You just need to represent a hand slightly stronger than his, even if it's also mediocre.

This is a common fallacy that poker players make when thinking about how to bluff. They concentrate their bluffs in places where they can represent flushes and straights, sets and overpairs and hands of that nature. But inherently, all of those hands have a very low absolute frequency. You don't get flushes and sets very often. So why try so hard to represent them?

Instead, these players should be trying to represent more hands like top pair low kicker. Hands like second pair value betting thin, or a medium pocket pair. They should be using more bluffing lines like check/check/bet, or check/bet/bet, or bet/check/bet, which inherently represent these weaker types of hands. These hands get dealt with a lot higher frequency, and so they are able to bluff to represent them much more often. You don't tend to win as big of pots by bluffing in this way, but the pots you are going to win will add up dramatically in the long run. Winning one extra 10bb pot per 100 hands amounts to a dramatic increase in winrate.

Now, the second principle of bluffing is a more advanced one, and hinges on knowing how your opponent thinks. But let's assume that your opponent is fairly intelligent, and is actively thinking about your ranges. Let's say you're in a spot where you shouldn't have any hands that don't have showdown value. As a general principle, most people (when they think about it) will assume that you are going to choose the path of least risk&mdash;which, by the way, is generally a good assumption. So since they know you can probably just check through and at least occasionally win without risking anything, they will assume you're not going to turn those hands into bluffs. They will then usually put your bluffing frequency at zero. Therefore, this is a spot where you should be bluffing.

To give a more concise statement: in spots where your opponent thinks you shouldn't have any need to bluff, you should bluff. Of course, I must disclaim this with the fact that this is only valid when your opponent is thinking about things like this, and the spot is salient or non-central enough for him to be consciously thinking about it.

So you can see there many more subtle aspects to thinking about bluffs than simply representing a big hand once in a while. There is a tremendous artistry and nuance to it that will take you a career to master.

I've shown you all these different perspectives on how to arrange your poker game on the holistic level, but we must next return to the reductionistic level, which is, after all, where all the real action happens. We may think about poker holistically away from the game and when we're conceiving of match dynamics, but in reality, poker is just hands. It's played through hands, through decisions, through constructing ranges one after another, and we would be remiss to neglect that. So remember that all of these big ideas must be put into effect into your game, one at a time, all very concretely. Now that we've set the foundation for poker strategy, we can look at the next element of poker thinking&mdash;psychology, and the art of randomness.

Congrats on getting through that!

Hey all,

Summer classes are in full swing, and I've been super busy. Right now I'm taking a class on Virginia Woolf, which I needed for graduation. I don't know how many of you have actually read her novels… but holy shit, are they tedious. Her short stories and essays I can appreciate more, but something about the post-Victorian stream of consciousness is just… ugh.

Haha, I probably shouldn't criticize until I've gotten through the entire class. I also sent in my DSLR camera into the shop about a month ago. Those of you who have been following my blog may have noticed that after a certain point, there was a weird black spot in all of my photographs. Apparently, during a storm in Venice, a particle of dirt got lodged really deep in my camera's sensor. I had to send it off to Canon, and after a month and $200 now it's finally good as new, so I will probably start taking photographs again soon. The mental coaching is going well, and my students are readily improving. Once again, if you're interested, contact me at [haseebcoach at gmail dot com](mailto:haseebcoach@gmail.com).

Here's the third chapter of *The Philosophy of Poker*. This contains a lot of original material that I always wanted to teach someday, that I think no one else in the poker world has really articulated. Let me know what you guys think. As always, the next chapter will be forthcoming next week.

Enjoy!

#### I

There are two main aspects to playing good poker. The first we call strategy and the second, psychology, and the two are very different. But what exactly is the difference between strategy and psychology? Intuitively you know there's a difference, but try to state it in words. It's trickier than you might think.

You might have come up with something like &ldquo;strategy is how to play good fundamentals, while psychology is about getting into people's heads.&rdquo;

That's a good start, but we can be more exact than that. Psychology is about getting into people's heads, but more precisely&mdash;we get into people's heads so we can predict their gameplay. Strategy is what allows us to exploit decisions, but psychology is what allows us to predict them in the first place. Strategy is like the blade of a sword that lets us cut, but psychology is the hilt that allows us to guide the blade to where it's most effective. They are complementary.  You cannot exploit someone if you do not know what he's going to do&mdash;but simply knowing what he's going to do doesn't mean you're going to be able to maximally exploit it. Strategy works from a static place; that is, it's algorithmic. You input your opponent's strategy, and it spits out the proper counter-strategy. But psychology is more artistic. It is what allows you to predict and pre-empt those strategies and how they change, based on observations. Neither is sufficient without the other.

#### II

We can narrow down the role of psychology as it relates to poker in an interesting way. I discussed in the previous chapter various approaches to setting up bluffing and valuebetting frequencies. You might falsely presume that bluffing and valuebetting frequencies are essentially the same sort of thing, that to manipulate them you just raise one and lower the other as you please. But in reality, it's not that simple.

If you think about it, to say that your bluffing frequency is 0% is another way of saying that you never choose to bluff when given the opportunity. Remember, almost always in a specific spot, you'll have *some* hands you can bluff with. So to say your bluffing frequency is 0% is to say that you intentionally forego making bluffs. But on the other hand, to say that your valuebetting frequency is 0% is to say that you don't *have* any value hands in that spot. When you have a value hand, you don't &ldquo;make a choice&rdquo; whether or not to valuebet; you always valuebet when you have a set, or top pair, or whatever&mdash;thin value bets excluded.

Let's look at this more in-depth. Say you want to change your balance in a certain spot. To change your bluffing frequency is very easy, and it can be done immediately, because bluffing frequency is a matter of choice. It is therefore **local**. You simply &ldquo;decide&rdquo; that you want to bluff more in this spot, and then you do it; there are no other external factors you need to consider. But on the other hand, if you want to valuebet more in a certain spot, you cannot simply &ldquo;decide&rdquo; to valuebet more. Remember, your stack of wood, your supply of good hands, is finite and limited. So if you don't have any here with you, you'll have to take wood from elsewhere and re-allocate it here. Therefore, raising your value-betting frequency is not local, it is **systemic**, because you have to make changes to other parts of your poker system in order to balance and use the resources you need. That is, you have to remove the hands from somewhere else to bring them here.

We can think about this as the difference between psychology and strategy. Strategy is much more about making systemic, large-scale changes to our game to exploit our opponents. But psychology is more about internal, localized bluffing decisions. In other words, psychology usually centers on bluffing, because bluffing is where actual moment-to-moment choices are made. Valuebetting is tends to be much more a matter of large-scale strategy and range construction.

Of course, this is a simplification, and it's less than perfect. Technically speaking, there are some times that your range is so strong in a certain spot that you need to start including bluffs, and so on. But despite its simplification, it is a useful way of thinking, and it will give us a place to begin.

It's impossible to talk about poker without talking about psychology. And yet, it certainly seems that most of the language that we use to talk about psychology is incredibly imprecise. If you query random players about why they do what they do, you'll often hear people talking about their guts, about timing, about game flow. But if you probe them to explain these concepts, they're unable to do so. And how can you blame them? They're difficult concepts to put into words, and much of what happens on the psychological field is more intuitive than rational. But that doesn't mean that psychology is impervious to rational analysis. It simply means that it's difficult, and we're going to have to use language and concepts that are more precise than those we're used to using.

Psychology will take us many chapters to fully explore, but let's start from the beginning. What is **gameflow**?

Gameflow is notoriously difficult to define. Just the word &ldquo;flow&rdquo; seems to suggest a sort of airy elusiveness to the phrase. And yet, anyone who's put in significant hours at a poker table seems to know intuitively what it means.

The first way of getting at this word is to look how it's actually used in practice. What do people say about it? You might hear things like &ldquo;the gameflow wasn't going my way,&rdquo; or &ldquo;you should either bet or check this spot depending on gameflow.&rdquo; These are two different referents, and in order to understand this word we must separate them out.

In the first case, what gameflow refers to is the &ldquo;momentum&rdquo; of the match. I will address momentum later on in this chapter, but for our purposes we should try to eradicate this use of the word gameflow, since we already have a more exact word for the phenomenon.

The second case is the more typical, and more recalcitrant against definition. &ldquo;Bet or check depending on gameflow.&rdquo; How do we parse this? What phrase can we substitute in here for &ldquo;gameflow&rdquo;?  We might say &ldquo;the flow of the match,&rdquo; but that doesn't really help at all; it just substitutes another undefined word. We could try &ldquo;what you think he's going to do,&rdquo; but this seems imprecise and vague. Game flow is more specific than that.

How can we define game flow?

Let's try a little experiment. Historically, poker notation has been designed to notate hands synchronically. That is to say, we've come up with ways to denote how a single hand was played, notating every action on every street, which has evolved into modern hand histories. But we don't have any widely accepted notation on how to notate hands diachronically. The only way that we can show someone an entire session is by cutting and pasting every single hand played over that period of time. But let's see if we can do better than that.

First, let's come up with a symbol for each major play. We'll define valuebetting as *V*, bluffing as *B*, folding as *F*, and calling as *C*. So if there's a sequence of hands where, at the same pivotal point in the hand, on the first hand our opponent valuebets, then on the second hand he bluffs, then he valuebets again, then he check/folds, then he calls, we'd denote that as: *V · B · V · F · C*. That is, value, bluff, value, fold, call.

You might notice that in using this notation, we're discarding a lot of information. We don't say how big the pots are, or even similar they are, or even who the raiser was. This can be problematic, so we'll have to stipulate that we will only use this notation to analyze *similar* hands. For the purposes of this example, let's imagine that we're analyzing preflop 4-bets in a heads up match by one player. That is, this notation only arises once his opponent 3-bets this player, and this player chooses either to 4-bet for value, 4-bet as a bluff, to call his 3-bet, or to fold. So let's imagine the sequence of 20 hands that looks like this (which is transcribed from an actual match):

*F · F · C · F · V · F · B · V · F · C · F · F · F · B · F · F · F · V · F · C*

Now, the first thing you might notice over this sample is that this person 4-bets quite a lot by any standard (adding up the *V*s and *B*s, you get 5/20 or 25%), but this is only a small stretch of hands. Nevertheless, seeing it notated this way brings many things to light.

First, recall how I explained that we don't really &ldquo;choose&rdquo; to valuebet. We simply valuebet when we're dealt a good hand. The same can be said for calling hands to 3-bets. Although there is a little variation in players' 3-bet calling ranges, most players are calling primarily the same range (with a little variation along the tails of that range). Along those lines, a call doesn't really tend to influence the game flow of the 4-betting game, because people are almost always calling a pre-defined range, and don't play with that range too much. He simply calls when he's dealt a certain hand that he's supposed to call with. A call is also transparent&mdash;an opponent usually knows exactly what you're doing and what your range looks like when you call (you might mix this up by flatcalling AA sometimes, but this is so rare that it doesn't really affect the point).

So in a way, a call is a non-decision event in the gameflow, so we may as well eliminate them and get closer to the psychologically relevant action. By paring out the calls, the sequence then becomes:

*F · F · F · V · F · B · V · F · F · F · F · B · F · F · F · V · F*

Now, the argument we made about not &ldquo;choosing&rdquo; to call can be extended in the same way to 4-betting for value. Although there is a little variation in player's 4-betting value ranges, most players are 4-betting largely the same range for value (some players will 4-bet/call off AJ, 77+ in a heads up match if they 4-bet more, whereas tighter players may elect not to, but it's not a dramatic difference from the average). We can simplify and say that in a sense, a player has no control over his *V*s either, and if this exact sequence of cards were dealt to each and every one of us, all of our *V*s would appear in the exact same spots in the sequence.

However, this doesn't mean that we can eliminate the *V*s, because in fact our *V*s are indistinguishable**by our opponent from our *B*s, therefore they are significant events. From his perspective both events look identical&mdash;they are both simply 4-bets to him, and he cannot know which one is which. Our *V*s therefore influence the psychological game, even though we have no control over them, because every *V* and every *B* is evidence to him for us having more *B*s. That is to say, every 4-bet that he sees is evidence that we're 4-bet bluffing more often. Even if we 4-bet ten hands in a row with value hands, he is only likely to see at showdown only one or two of those, and assume that the ones he didn't see were bluffs.

So let's see what this looks like when we emphasize the *B*s and *V*s&mdash;that is, the 4-bets.

*F · F · F · V · F · B · V · F · F · F · F · B · F · F · F · V · F*

By highlighting it this way, we can see how the *F*s become like the spaces around the 4-bets. So how can we explain the dynamics behind this sequence? Look at our pattern of *F*s here. First we have three continuous folds, then we have a value hand. Then we fold one hand, then we make a bluff. We get dealt a value hand immediately afterward. Knowing that our opponent just saw a condensed sequence of bets, we decide to cool it, and we make four folds. Then one bluff, then three more folds, then a value hand comes by again, and after that a fold.

Clearly, this player is usually choosing to fold three hands or so between his bluffs. After the sequence of *V · F · B· V* put together, he folds for an extra-long sequence of four hands, probably to compensate for the fact that his opponent assumes he's getting out of line, and he wants to restore his image. At the end of the sequence there is one last valuebet, followed by a bluff. If I were a betting man, I'd bet that following this pattern, the player in this example folded the next two or three hands after this.

Basically, what we've just done is analyzed the gameflow of this twenty-hand sequence. Using this perspective we can define the word more concretely: gameflow is the *pattern* of decisions made over time, and how that pattern influences subsequent decisions (we might be inclined to call it the pattern of bluffs and valuebets, but it's not always restricted to that). In trying to analyze this pattern, there are two main elements of gameflow: **simulated randomness**, and **emotional dynamics**, each of which I will go over in depth. But I want to start our exploration with one peripheral thesis in the background, which I want you to consider as we start uncovering these topics.

The thesis is this: gameflow is a *human* phenomenon. That is, if two computers played each other (and both computers knew the other was a computer), gameflow would not exist.

#### IV

How good do you think you are at being random?

No need to answer, actually. According to the bulk of scientific studies, most of us are pretty bad at it. For example, let's say that you took a bunch of people into a room, and asked them to simulate random coinflips. That is, you don't give them any coins, but tell them to imagine that they're flipping a fair coin 20 times, and to write down the imagined results. What do they do?

Well, they usually end up pretty close to 10 heads and 10 tails, often within one flip. This might be reassuring to you, but it shouldn't be. People will almost never end up with 7 heads and 13 tails, or 6 heads and 14 tails&mdash;on average, the proportionality will tend to look too perfect compared to true randomness.

Secondly, their clusters tend to be too small. That is, if H is heads and T is tails, people would tend to write something like HHHTTHTTTHTTTHHHTHTH. Observe this sequence. The longest cluster here is three letters. That might seem fine and random-looking to you, but what that means is that, predictably, the chance of the pattern discontinuing after three letters is close to 100%, where obviously it should be 50%.

Now here's an actual randomly generated coinflip sequence: THTHHTTHTHTTTTTTTHTHT. As you can see, this particular string has 6 heads and 14 tails, with one cluster 5 letters long.

Another example of this phenomenon is if you take dots in space. If I ask you to imagine what a random grid full of 100 dots looks like, you're probably going to imagine something like this:

![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rVRyLUd5iBQ/T9uEiWB6OZI/AAAAAAAABRI/CR0ievHThig/s1600/uniform.GIF)

Wrong. A *truly randomly generated* grid of dots actually looks more like this: 

![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ev2jMDqxZOk/T9uEmwlzIaI/AAAAAAAABRQ/gpwZyo3leUo/s1600/random.GIF)

What can we conclude from this? Basically, people have a pre-conceived idea in their head of what randomness &ldquo;looks like.&rdquo; That image of randomness tends to be quite pristine and orderly compared to reality; it is unnaturally periodic and uniform. True randomness has clusters, and tends to look less pretty.

This is the same sort of thing that is going on in gameflow. A big element of what we're doing in gameflow is* attempting to simulate randomness*.

Remember the sequence from before:

*F · F· F · V · F · B · V · F · F · F · F· B · F · F · F · V · F*

This time I've bolded the folds and bluffs. Recall how I said that we don't really &ldquo;choose&rdquo; when to valuebet, we simply valuebet when we have good hands. By that logic, what I've bolded are *the plays we're in control of*. In other words, it is through our pattern of folding and bluffing that we attempt to simulate randomness in the 4-betting game.

Now, let's pull back for a second, and try to generalize to a higher-level metagame. When it comes to gameflow, we have two metagame choices at any given time. The first is to try to look random, to try to look honest, so to speak. The second is to try to appear intentional and non-random. When would we want to do either of these?

Specifically in the 4-betting game, there are two possible incentives for us. First would be for us to be bluffing and for our opponent to think we're valuebetting, and the second would be for us to be valuebetting and for him to think we're bluffing. We have to consider how we can accomplish either of these through our actions.

Remember, the only truly random events in the 4-betting game are getting dealt value hands&mdash;everything else is only simulated randomness. So if we can convince him that all bluffs are actually just the distribution of those random value hands, then we accomplish the first incentive&mdash;getting him to think we're valuebetting when we're bluffing. The second incentive&mdash;getting him to think we're bluffing when we're valuebetting&mdash;is less actionable, because in order to accomplish that we need to make our *valuebets* look intentional, or non-random. Of course, it's great when that happens. You'll notice how when you get big pocket pairs three times in a row, you tend to get paid off on the second and third one. This is why&mdash;it doesn't look random to your opponents. Unfortunately, when we get dealt our value hands is not within our control. The only thing we can control is how well we simulate randomness to our opponent.

So the importance of simulating randomness is getting our opponent to think we're valuebetting when we're actually bluffing&mdash;in other words, to overrepresent the *V*s in our sequence. How can we use all this information to help us improve at gameflow?

#### V

In essence, game flow is a language. The phrases in this language are the patterns of folds and bets that two players make with one another. But as any language, they are not communicating directly&mdash;their phrases only have meaning by way of their referents, or signification. In this case, what they signify are the patterns of simulated randomness.

Remember, people tend to have an inordinately tidy notion of what randomness looks like, and poker players are no exception to this rule. Furthermore, when poker players are faced with randomness, they face it *experientially­*– even if they are cognitively aware of the aforementioned randomness bias, they are not facing randomness in poker as one discrete string of letters, like the Ts and Hs we're presented with in our analysis. Most poker players are therefore subject to the much the same tendencies in this regard.

 So we know what our opponent expects randomness to look like&mdash;orderly and uniform. In that case, it doesn't matter that we know *true randomness*tends to cluster and look more irregular. Our goal is in fact not to be truly random, but to make him think that we're random, which means we must accord to *his*preconceived notions of randomness.

You might say therefore, that our final conclusion would be that in creating our gameflow strings, it is best to make them to look regular, and to distribute them as evenly and orderly as possible (with enough variations to look random-ish, and not simply repeating after every third fold). That would be an easy conclusion, and in fact, you probably already intuitively do that. But it is from here that leveling game and complexities of gameflow begin.

You could say in a sense that because almost everybody tries to construct their gameflow in this way, this simple method of depicting randomness has become the norm. Your opponents will automatically assume that this is what you're doing&mdash;in fact, it's just what *people do*. We could say in a sense that this is the first level of the randomness-simulating game. If you're any good at all, your opponent will assume that you know that this is how randomness-simulating is &ldquo;supposed&rdquo; to be done.

What we can do next, then, is to depart from this first level, and start to engage in wordplay.

First, remember in this first level of randomness-simulating, the *V*s, which are truly random, will sometimes unwittingly cluster after *B*s. This is simply a matter of happenstance. A first-level randomness-simulator will almost always immediately cool off after such a cluster, as though to signal to his opponent, &ldquo;don't think this reflects on my image! My hands just randomly clustered; it wasn't my fault!&rdquo;

The second leveler decides to start playing with this language. The second leveler knows that his opponent has been conditioned by all of the other poker players to see clusters as being unintentional&mdash;something that a poker player will apologize for, and avoid. In this way, clusters have effectively taken on a meaning of harmlessness. And because he perceives that, a second leveler realizes that he can use clusters as a tool in his gameflow arsenal.

Instead of always trying to simulate spacious orderliness, he starts utilizing clusters. He'll bluff twice in a row. Three times in a row. He'll *B · B · F · B*. Not too often of course&mdash;he cannot afford for his opponent to be absolutely sure how he is playing with this language. The second leveler wants his opponent to believe that he is just a first leveler on a good run. In this way, he develops a second-order metagame of gameflow phrases. For example, we could say 1 = *B · F · F · F*, his basic spaciously random phrase, and 2 = *B · B · F · B* (and so on, but we'll stop here to simplify the example). The second order gameflow metagame might look like:

*1 · 1 · 2 · 1 · 1 · 2 · 1 · 2 · 1 · 1*

So in order to attain mastery of gameflow, one must learn how to be able to play with clusters. Great players all are aware on some level of their mutual capability to play with these clustered strings, and it is the battleground for many serious mindgames. But in the end it is only through play and experimentation that you discover how your opponent reacts to these clusters, how willing he is to believe them, and what sort of threshold he has before he is impelled to action. Ideally, you want to skirt until the very edge of this threshold.

You want to find and bluff up until the very edge of his patience, for that line is the line of maximal exploitation.

I would be remiss, however, not to admit that I have simplified this example. Generally speaking, one does not simply choose 4-bet bluffing hands on the basis of gameflow&mdash;most people are choosing only good hands to 4-bet with that have some playability in the case that your opponent calls, or some card-cancelling effects (i.e., ace-rag). This has the effect of automatically further randomizing your 4-bets, provided that you never 4-bet unless your hand falls within that threshold of hands you're willing to 4-bet with. In essence, this dampens the gameflow. It still exists, but it is less granular than in other more obvious gameflow sequences.

#### VI

In the end, gameflow is the stream through which everything in poker flows. It is omnipresent, inescapable. Every hand that is ever played between two humans will be processed through these patterns.

Consider the large scale adjustments we discussed in the previous chapter. We talked about sweeping ideas like balance, constructing frequencies and ranges and so on. Perhaps when it comes to being dealt value hands, which are out of our control, we can concede to that approach to analyzing poker. But when it comes to bluffing, we see now just how many decisions there are to make, how many games within games, how inexhaustible the complexities of the moment. It is one thing to say we want to bluff 66%, a grand holistic number, but the art of bluffing from hand to hand is atomic, reductionistic, one hand after another.

Do these perspectives contradict one another? Which is correct?

Let's construct an example. Let's say that you wanted your bluffing frequency in all spots *X* to be exactly 50%. And let's say that aggregated over an entire match, you bluffed in spot *X* fifty times, where spot *X* came up 100 times over the match. On first glance, we could say that you have accomplished the frequency you set out for. But perhaps, in fact, for *X*<sub>1</sub>, *X*<sub>2</sub>, *X*<sub>3</sub>… *X*<sub>50</sub> you never bluffed, and then for *X*<sub>51</sub>, *X<sub>52</sub>*, *X<sub>53</sub>*… *X*<sub>100</sub>, you always bluffed. Averaged over the total match, you could consider this to be the 50% bluffing frequency you wanted&mdash;but obviously that's absurd on its face. We would naturally call this instead a bluffing frequency of 0% for 50 hands, and then 100% for the next 50 hands.

Let's extend that same argument to a more realistic sequence. Perhaps you think you're being balanced over a 10 hand stretch, but your pattern of bluffs is *F · B · F · B · F · B · F · B · F · B*. You might reasonably call this a balanced sequence where your bluffing frequency is 50%. But we could also say that for each individual spot in the sequence, your bluffing frequency is either 0% or 100% depending on whether the instance is odd or even. You see, even if we make the pattern more complex and not perfectly repeating: *B · F · B · F · B · B · F · F · B · F*, you can extend the very same argument, albeit with lower accuracy (instead of 100%, it might become 80% likelihood on every even number).

You can see where this argument is going. Perhaps it's possible that in our humanness, in our bounded abilities to simulate randomness, we will never be able to truly randomly re-create any large-scale statistical percentages; perhaps over an entire match when we tell ourselves we're going to bluff 33%, really in every given spot we're predictably (perhaps we don't know the algorithm that predicts it and perhaps our current opponent doesn't either, but predictably nevertheless) bluffing a lot higher or a lot lower than 33%, and never at any given time are we close to the actual frequency we're aiming for. Are we foolish to even plan something like that to begin with?

Let's say that hypothetically we equipped ourselves with a random number generator, into which we could enter in a frequency (e.g., 50%), and it would output either *B* or *F* perfectly randomly. That is, we'd forego trying to simulate randomness&mdash;we'd use *real* randomness. Imagine the consequences.

It's tantalizing, isn't it? Essentially, if we did this, we would throw off our humanness. We would become one step closer to machines, and escape the stream of gameflow. Would that not be a molting out of our human shells; would that not be a victory of our ingenuity?

In fact, I know of some people who have attempted to play poker this way. Such programs are actually very easy to make. And yet, you look around and nobody does this. So why isn't this widespread? Why didn't this method catch on?

In a way, doing something like this&mdash;randomizing your gameflow&mdash;is like trying to be perfectly balanced. It doesn't attempt to exploit your opponents, but instead, absconds from the exploitative game altogether. The field of battle becomes smaller. Whatever potential mistakes your opponent could be induced into making in gameflow are now dismissed when you randomize in this way. If in every spot *X* you always bluff exactly 50% of the time completely randomly, then it doesn't matter how your opponent *patterns* his guesses over time, the only thing that matters is his overall proportion of guesses. Once you do this, the river of gameflow begins to dry up.

Consider the following: by necessity, in all matches, if one is not artificially perfectly randomizing one's gameflow, then *someone is always going to be better than the other at the randomness game*. That is to say, either you will make your opponent guess wrong better-than-chance, or your opponent will be able to guess right better-than-chance. It's always one or the other, in every match. So if we were to choose when to use the randomizing machine, the optimal strategy would be to only use it in cases where we believed our opponent was *better than us* at the randomizing game. In any case where he isn't, we should choose instead to play the game of gameflow, to dissect the stream into its individual atoms, to look him in the eyes and try to outwit him.

But in the end, the reason why people haven't started using randomizing programs (other than, of course, because people tend to overestimate their own skill) is because reading and creating gameflow are skills that can only be honed through undergoing repeated practice and stress. Using a program of that nature to escape gameflow only retards your progress as a poker player. After all, the very players who *can* out-read you are the ones against whom you want to be honing and practicing your gameflow, in order to get to the point that you can overtake them. It is only through failure and loss that any of us have the opportunity to grow.

After all, gameflow is a characteristically *human* phenomenon. But as poker is a game played between humans, it becomes a vital terrain to master.

#### VII

Now, in our reductionism we have been overly simplistic. We have assumed we can dissect a poker match into similarly related hands, and analyze their individual sequence in isolation. But we all know that in reality, a poker match is not that cut and dry. The way we presented the 4-betting game was very discrete, but in reality, most bluffing spots affect one another, even if the spots are dissimilar. It's clearly relevant to a 4-bet in our pattern whether or not somebody just lost a huge all-in the previous hand.

This is due to the **emotional dynamic**. The emotional dynamic can be defined simply as the way that emotions and the *perceptions* of emotions affect gameplay. Note the emphasis on &ldquo;perceptions.&rdquo; It's obvious that two very emotional players will be subject to emotional dynamics, but it is also the case that two especially stoic players, who do not emotionally respond to something like losing a big pot, are still responding to emotional dynamics. That is, each player will assume that the *other* is responding to emotional dynamics, and will also assume that his opponent assumes that he himself is going to be emotional even if he isn't, and so on.

For example, let's say you never get angry after losing big pots (perhaps because you just got married today, and so you're too elated to be phased). The moment after you lose a big pot, the emotional dynamics that govern that match aren't dismissed merely because you don't feel any anger&mdash;you have to respond to the fact that your opponent *expects* you to feel angry. The fact that you're &ldquo;supposed&rdquo; to feel angry implies that the next hand, your opponent will expect you to get out of line, and so you have added incentive to do the opposite. Emotional dynamics are just as much about perceptions and stereotypes as they are about reality.

Emotional dynamics is like the undercurrent of feelings that underlies a match. It is the tide of emotions as it ebbs and flows over time. As human beings, we are acutely aware of emotions before we think in terms of strategy. Long before we were assigning preflop raising standards and postflop tendencies, we were saying &ldquo;this guy must be pissed off,&rdquo; or &ldquo;that guy must be thrilled.&rdquo; It is the most apparent way of making sense of what's going on at a poker table, but even at the highest levels, it must be taken into account.

Tilt is an enormous topic in poker, so I will be addressing only the smaller part of it in this chapter: the tilt of other players. As far as the tilt that you yourself experience and grapple with&mdash;that a much larger and more expansive subject, which we will explore later. For now, let's look at what we can say about *other people's* tilt.

**Tilt** can be defined most simply as allowing one's emotions to negatively affect one's gameplay (notably, we tend to exclude fear as an emotion from this definition). Generally speaking, you will see tilt activated by three major events: a failed play, a lost pot, or an emotionally compromising state (i.e., he's had a bad day, he's tired, he's drunk, etc.). This much is obvious if you have any experience at a poker table, and there is little need for us to expound on it. But there are a few important aspects of how tilt arises that I want us to consider.

First, tilt in its nature can be likened to boiling a pot of water. There is a threshold of negative events that a player can take and maintain his constitution, just as how a pot of water can take a certain amount of heat before it reacts. Once it gets near the boiling temperature, only then it begins to bubble&mdash;and once you push it far above that boiling temperature, it reacts more and more violently. This is essentially how tilt works. Any opponent will be able to take a certain amount of beating, until he hits his tilt threshold and starts to react. The further you push him past this threshold, the more and more he will react. But not all opponents will tilt in the same way.

There are many different styles of tilt that you'll see among players, but generally speaking there are two main species of tilt that you should be looking out for. The first is **hot tilt** and the second is **cold tilt**. Hot tilt is the more familiar one&mdash;it is generally a tilt of anger (whether from entitlement, frustration, victimization, or whatever). The player will be aggressively trying to get even, and so he will play more aggressively, make more wild calls, and more crazy plays. The emblematic play of a hot tilter is a preflop open shove. Of course, once you start playing serious stakes, you're almost never going to see this (especially not in the year 2012), but it's nevertheless the spirit behind hot tilt. Every bad play of hot tilt is in a sense just a preflop shove with less money behind it.

The second kind of tilt is cold tilt. Cold tilt is more passive&mdash;it is generally a tilt of resignation, lethargy, and disheartenment. A cold tilter will start playing more passively, making less plays at pots, folding more to big bets, and acting as though he's incapable of wrestling for pots. You'll find a player in cold tilt when he is running poorly, you've got strong momentum on him, and he can't seem to muster anything together&mdash;but you haven't outright destroyed him in the match. He'll start to feel a little helpless and feel like all of his moves are getting squashed, but he won't feel like you're completely beating him down, so he'll still have a bit of faith in the core of his game. Generally what this will do is mollify his aggression, lock away his fancy moves back into the closet, and leave him playing only the most basic part of his game. A player on cold tilt is a player who's lost his confidence, but isn't convinced yet that he should quit. Where hot tilt tries to overpower and strongarm his opponent to get even, cold tilt is essentially hoping for a good run of cards to get him even.

Not all players tilt the same, and you should be reacting to each of these two types of tilters differently. Against someone who's going through a stretch of cold tilt, aggression is key. Once your opponent has put down all of his aggressive weapons, you should pull out your entire arsenal and snatch away every dollar he doesn't fight for. Against someone on hot tilt on the other hand, it is often enough to just play solidly and adapt to his wider postflop ranges, incorporating some heavier aggression to attack his weakened ranges, but not moving too far outside your normal tightness. Simply playing reasonably will often inherently exploit a hot tilter fairly well&mdash;just be sure you're not giving up too many pots simply because of his aggression.

There is another vital point to be made here on how to play against a tilter. Say, okay, we know our opponent is tilting. What do we do against him now? Do we just keep playing our normal game and let him eat his own screw-ups?

First, you must consider an important question. Why is your opponent tilting? This is important. If you can identify the emotion or incentive for which your opponent is tilting, then you can better take advantage of the situation. Remember that *even in tilt, your opponent is not acting irrationally.* On the contrary, he is still acting in accordance with his values, but his values have now shifted. The value of playing soundly and taking the most +EV line has been superseded by the value of trying to increase variance, or maximize his winnings, or vent his anger, or whatever it is he's trying to do. You need to consider&mdash;what does my opponent value right now? Because once you figure out what that is, *you need to give it to him*.

What do I mean by this?

It's the most common thing in the world. You play against somebody who's tilting, he's starting to really spew, and soon after, he quits you. You probably don't even notice or think this is a big deal, but it is. It's a huge opportunity lost. When your opponent is tilting, you want to *keep him tilting*. And in order to do that, you must understand how and why he's tilting, and how to keep him in that headspace.

Say, for example, that you can tell your opponent wants to maximize variance&mdash;he's 3-betting 50% now, and seems to be potting or c/fing on flops. So your opponent's incentive is *maximizing variance*. Now, an adjustment a lot of people will make to this will be to start minraising, since if he keeps 3-betting the minraises, it'll create much deeper SPRs (stack-to-pot ratios) postflop, which will give you the advantage. Well, turns out this is a terrible mistake, because your opponent will leave pretty fast once you start doing this. And of course, because you usually don't know *for sure* that he left because of what you were doing, it's easy to dismiss this event and not recognize it as a mistake.

Instead, a more experienced player knows to *give the tilter what he wants*. The moment that you are playing against a tilter, he has established a symbiotic relationship with you. You are now exchanging value. You are giving him what he wants (variance, a chance to get even, a way to vent) and he is giving you what you want&mdash;his EV. In the end, he doesn't have to tilt against *you*. He can go off to some other table for someone else to give him that, or he can go play roulette, or punch his wall, or whatever. If that's what your opponent wants, then it's your job to *be all those things for him*&mdash;be his roulette table, his wall to punch, his whatever. Be what he needs, and he will keep playing you.

So what does that mean in practice? It means if your opponent wants to maximize variance by 3-betting you 50%, then let the variance increase. Tighten up your opens, play bigger pots, and play faster. Rather than minraising 100% on the button, 3x 70% instead, widen your 4-betting range, and try to play faster to make the game speed up. This will make him feel like the game is moving and that he can get all the variance he wants in a shorter amount of time. With the game speeding up, your folding is not as likely to make the game (or variance) feel like it's being slowed down. Chances are, your opponent will stay with you if you keep it up, and you can rest assured that if he leaves, you did all you could to keep him.

Remember, if your opponent is going to be choosing a suboptimal strategy, there is generally more than one way for you to exploit it. You want to weigh each of these options based on how they coincide with what is motivating his tilt, and choose the better option. But generally speaking, you don't want to just submit to a suboptimal strategy if you can avoid it&mdash;i.e., if somebody's 3-betting 50%, and you don't feel comfortable calling a wide range against him, you usually don't want to continue 3xing 100% on the button if you can avoid it. But again the bottom line is: if a tilter wants something, give it to him. The customer is always right.

#### VIII

Earlier on I spoke of **momentum**, and vaguely equated it to &ldquo;how the match is going.&rdquo; Again, this is one of those intuitive words that we all seem to use, but eludes definition. What is momentum exactly? More specifically&mdash;we've already come to the conclusion that gameflow is a purely human phenomenon. Is momentum the same way? Is momentum simply &ldquo;imagined into existence,&rdquo; a psychological phantasm, or is it a real thing, rooted in the cards themselves? Would a computer playing poker feel momentum?

To begin, let's look at real instances of momentum. We'll take two examples&mdash;one of positive momentum, and one of negative. In the positive, let's say that our opponent is down two buyins; we make a big three barrel bluff where a draw misses, and he tanks and folds the river. We feel pretty good about this, and we can imagine he feels pretty wobbly. Now, in the negative, let's say that *we* are down two buyins; we're facing a three barrel when the draw misses, we tank for a long time and then fold. He thinks and doesn't show. We're now down three buyins and we feel like we just got body-slammed.

Where does the momentum actually come from in each of these examples? Certainly, a big part of it comes from the emotional reaction to the event. Even the best, most equanimous poker players in the world would have some kind of emotional response here, however small. But let's try a little thought experiment. Imagine for a second that we *don't* have an emotional reaction to this. Totally cut out the emotional element. Imagine maybe that you won the lottery today, so you don't really care about being down three buyins; you've just become a multi-millionaire, so you're on way too big of a high to care. Pretend you're totally Zen'd out. Really imagine it!

Close your eyes. He shoves, you tank fold, and he doesn't show. Now what? Is the negative momentum still there? Do you still feel it?

I'm guessing you do. Even if you don't feel anything physiologically negative or painful, *you feel the feeling of playing from behind*. You feel the momentum.

So momentum is more than just the emotion. Well, you could make the argument, as we did with emotional dynamics, that your opponent's expectations affect the match just as much as the emotions themselves. So if your opponent expects you to feel behind, you have to react to that expectation, and *that's* really what momentum is about.

Although this is true, this doesn't seem satisfactory either. This phenomenon is, after all, a result of imperfect information&mdash;our opponent has to make assumptions about us because he doesn't know us. But let's say we're playing someone who *knows* that we've just won the lottery, and so he knows three buyins isn't going to affect us emotionally. Is the momentum still there? Imagine it.

Yup, still there. So what is momentum then exactly?

It seems almost mystical. Being a poker player, you know from the bottom of your heart that it's impossible for what you're dealt in one hand to affect what you're dealt in the next hand. All hands are independently random events, aren't they? So why should we have more expectation of losing when the momentum is negative, even when we take all of the emotions out of it? It doesn't seem to make sense.

And yet, no matter who you are in the world, or how well you control your emotions, we want to advise the person with positive momentum &ldquo;keep playing!&rdquo; and the one with negative, &ldquo;quit now, tomorrow's another day!&rdquo;

You could try to explain this all away as an example of the gambler's fallacy (the tendency to see nonexistent patterns in chaotic information), but I think you miss something if you try to explain it all away. There is another answer is rather more interesting. If you think about it, if you tank-fold a river when the draw misses and don't get to see what he has, what has taken place is not merely an emotional spike. You have also created an **informational asymmetry**. In other words, your opponent now has acquired more information than you have. By the fact that you tank-folded, *he knows* that you were considering a hero-call, and decided to fold it instead. He knows that the weight of evidence you evaluated made you decide it was a fold, so he can reconstruct your mindset and assumptions about him. But *you don't know whether or not he was bluffing*. While you have gained no information, your opponent gains a great deal. This is informational asymmetry, and it's a significant part of the reason why when you have negative momentum, you expect to continue to play from behind.

There *are* certain situations that produce negative momentum which don't necessarily have informational asymmetry, such as a big hero call. Say we bluff on a board where the draw misses, and our opponent snapcalls our river shove with bottom pair. He got the information that we are shoving that river with air, but we also got the information that he's calling with anything and clearly doesn't believe us. So although we lose a buyin here, we can actually make a useful adjustment by tightening up and not bluffing anymore in spots like this. But again, in real matches, negative momentum will still persist, not only from emotional reactions (who wouldn't feel a punch in the gut to get a bluff shove snapcalled by bottom pair?), but also from the fear that your opponent has a better and more accurate read than you do.

So momentum is real, in many more senses than one. And what this tells us is that one should never be ashamed of quitting a match when one's momentum is negative. There are always more matches to play, and more fish in the sea.

#### IX

So we've looked now at the art of randomness and emotional dynamics, but that leaves us with the final and largest element of psychology unexplored&mdash;opponent modeling. That is, our ability to observe our opponent and integrate all of the information we collect into a coherent model of behavior. Again, we will begin our exploration in the external, and move toward the internal&mdash;that is, we'll begin with thinking about how our opponents construct their perceptions of us, and then we'll move on in the next chapter as to how we will construct our models of them.

We refer generally to the phenomenon of our opponents perceiving our behavior as our **image**. Image is what we imagine our opponents see, and how we think they are judging our behavior. Unfortunately, giving it a name doesn't help us get any closer to figuring out how it works.

The first and most pre-eminent rule of thumb that dictates how image is formed is **the strength of first impressions**. The strength of first impressions is a cognitive bias that is widespread and universal, no matter who you're dealing with. It can be simply defined as *the resistance of initially constructed models to be altered by later information*.

For example, if in the first couple of hands since you sit down, you 3-bet twice (perhaps the second time for value), your opponent will immediately form a model of you as an over-aggressive 3-betty player. Even if after twenty hands your frequency becomes depressed enough as to appear normal, it will take a much longer time for him to extinguish the attributes that he's ascribed to you&mdash;and even if he finally changes his model, he will be quick to return to the initial one if he sees you ever do a run of 3-bets again.

You should take advantage of this bias by always being sensitive to what your initial plays are, and how they are likely to appear to your opponent. Rather than thinking about your *actual* frequencies (whether you're really a tight or a loose 3-bettor), learn to focus instead on what he has seen in his limited experience (i.e., don't commit the fallacy of omniscience).

The second rule of thumb is **the projection bias**. The projection bias refers to a subconscious presumption that other people think like we do&mdash;which by extension means that they perceive like we do, and that they will act as we do in most situations.

One can extrapolate many conclusions from this bias, but the most important is this: players will expect everyone else to think and act the way that they do. This implies that, all things equal, *conservative players will expect other people to play more conservative, and loose players will expect other players to play looser.* Generally speaking, if you're playing against a nit, he probably assumes you're nittier than you really are, and if you're playing against a maniac, he probably expects you to be more maniacal than you really are. This is not to say that they think you will do exactly what they would do, but instead that their perception of your behavior will consistently be swayed in their own direction. Remembering this bias will serve you well in reconstructing other player's perceptions, and expectations.

So we've looked closely at some big psychological concepts, but to get further in our analysis of psychology, we must begin to turn inward, and make a deep and substantial analysis of opponent modeling. By first learning how to construct models of our opponents, how to predict their behavior, and studying the nature of our interactions with them, only then will we be able to effectively play the adjustment game against them&mdash;all of which we will explore in the following chapter.

I hope you found all that interesting. Leave a comment and let me know what you thought. Or if you have any questions, corrections, or suggestions, drop a comment. Till next week!

Hey guys,

Sorry for missing my update last week. Finals caught me off guard, and it's been tough to keep up writing consistently. I'm taking a full summer term as you guys know, so there's a lot of schoolwork to keep up with&mdash;5 days a week, with lots of homework. Once this semester is over, I'll have a four day break and then onto my next term of classes, haha. But I've finally finished this chapter, so gave it a once-over and now posting it today.

In the rest of my life I've kept myself challenged, and alongside my JKD and boxing training, I've started taking up weightlifting again to round out my physique. For a long time while I was traveling, I got really used to just doing body weight exercises. Whenever I was in a new city, I would go out one day into a park or some sparsely populated field, and just do pushups, sit-ups, squats, and dips. I'd gotten so used to that since living on the road, that it's been over a year now probably that I've used any weights. But it's hard to develop a ton of strength off of just body weight exercises, so I'll see where this takes me. Luckily it allows me to eat a lot more food, which is always a bonus, haha. I've kept up paleo pretty well so far now too, which is kind of a surprise to me, since cutting out all grains really excludes most of the standard American diet. That's okay though. I feel pretty good about it.

Mental coaching has been going well and I've been getting really good feedback from clients. I've decided to raise my rate to **$150/hr**. Probably once my summer term is finished, I'll write up something more comprehensive about mental coaching (and I'll have more time then to devote to it), but for now, if you're curious feel free to shoot me an e-mail at [haseebcoach at gmail dot com](mailto:haseebcoach@gmail.com).

Anyway, without further ado, here is Chapter 4. Hope you guys enjoy.

#### I

In poker, it is not our opponents against whom we make our decisions.

What do I mean by this? Of course, there is a sense in which we make our decisions against our actual opponents. But that sense is the same sense in which poker is a chess match&mdash;our opponent is, in a profound way, inaccessible to us. All we have access to is the shadow he throws against us, the schema we can construct of him. When we play poker, we make plays and adjustments not on our opponents, but on our mental models of them.

The process of creating predictive mental models is called **opponent modeling**.

The models that we develop in a poker match are fluid and constantly changing. But as we improve as poker players, one of the chief ways in which we develop is being able to construct better and more accurate models of our opponents.

I am going to lead you through a step-by-step examination of every aspect of developing a mental model of your opponent, and the common pitfalls that might hinder us along the way. But we must, as always, begin our exploration from the solid, from the real. We must start this exploration at the experience of a poker match itself.

#### II

You sit down at a table. There's your opponent. You've never seen him before. Here's your first hand. The action's on you.

Of course, we've been in this situation thousands of times. But we fail to notice how special this first hand is. The first hand is not only where you have to make an initial read on your opponent, but it's also the only point in the match that is completely *tabula rasa*&mdash;where you know absolutely nothing about your opponent. So what do you do?

Well, you obviously act on something. You don't simply throw your arms up in the air and surrender to your ignorance, and you don't just throw a dart on the wall and guess wildly what kind of a player you think he'll be. What you act upon is your **standard model**. The standard model is basically the mental model you've created of the *average* poker player.

In observing all of the poker players you've ever played, you slowly accrue and shape your standard model, conditioning it bit by bit over time by all the things you see people do, all the ways they seem to think, until you have in your mind a pretty firm idea of what the average player looks like. Of course, the more experienced and the more observant you are of your opponents, the more accurate this standard model is likely to be as the average opponent.

In a way, the moment you sit down at a new table with someone you don't know, what you face across from you is not your opponent as he truly is. What you are looking at is your standard model of an opponent. It is against this standard model against which you are reacting, upon which you ascribe intentions, and whose hand you are trying to read.

Consider this. Imagine you see someone 3-bet the first hand in a match, and you fold. What can you infer about this opponent?

If you were looking solely at his stats, you'd see that his 3-bet frequency was 100%. So are you going to play him assuming that he's literally 3-betting 100% of hands? Technically, in a vacuum, it's not an irrational conclusion. It seems silly to us of course, but *why* is it silly? What makes it silly?

The reason why it's silly is because we know that *no one* 3-bets 100%. 100% 3-bettors do not exist within the population of poker players. Note then, we are not simply using his actions to determine his behavior, otherwise it *would* be correct to assume he's 3-betting 100%. Instead, interpret his actions in light of how we know frequencies to be distributed *over the entire population*. In other words, we are already thinking about the wider population of poker players, and using that as a basis to build our model of our opponent.

In statistics, this problem is known as *Bayesian updating*. Using the average 3-betting frequency, the standard deviation (how wide the distribution of 3-betting frequencies is in the population), and the piece of evidence we're presented with (our opponent's 3-bet), we could use Bayesian equations to compute his average 3-betting frequency given the evidence of one 3-bet. To throw out a number off the top of my head, chances are it'd be something about 2% or 3% higher than the average based on this one event.

Now, how to play against someone in your first hand might seem like a trivial problem, but this is the origination of how all reads on our opponents work. From the first hand of every match, we begin with another instance of our standard model, like a ready-made figure of clay. With every subsequent decision that we observe in our opponent, we begin to sculpt this figure, departing from this standard model bit by bit&mdash;never abandoning it, but only transforming it. Over time enough time and information, this model starts to develop its own distinct personality. We start to see the color of its eyes, the shape of its jaw, and all the various irregularity of detail that makes a real person.

It is clearly important then to have an accurate standard model, since the more accurate your standard model is, the better you are able to initially predict your opponent's play on average. This is the first skill in opponent modeling&mdash;before you can model any particular opponent, you must have a clear idea of what the average opponent looks like. First rate players are highly knowledgeable of *common* leaks, *common* weaknesses, which they will infer upon and attack in players they don't know. This is part of what makes them so strong. In order to develop this standard model, you must play a lot of players, and pay close attention to what they do. Over time, you will begin to recognize common patterns, faults, presumptions, and states of mind in your opponents that will inform your standard model.

I mentioned the projection bias in the previous chapter&mdash;the tendency to impute one's own perceptions and tendencies on other people. Of course, you are no exception to this bias. Every standard model that you produce will be biased to be more like yourself. Where you don't clearly and distinctly see otherwise, you will tend to think that people make the same sorts of mistakes that you do, think about spots the same way you do, process gameflow the same way that you do, and so on. Every standard model that a player produces will be, in some way, in his own image. In spots that are highly non-central, this bias is amplified, since in non-central and rare spots you don't have a wealth of empirical data to counteract this bias. The only real way to fight this bias is to be aware of it, and to remain open to the idea that your opponents don't always see poker the way that you do.

I said before that the standard model is never completely abandoned. But you could also argue that any player has multiple standard models. That is, once you use the standard model after some hands, and notice that your opponent is fairly aggressive or fairly passive, you might swap out your standard model of the *average *player for your standard model of the aggressive player, or passive player, and so on, continually swapping models as your read becomes more and more nuanced, until you finally have a truly individual model of your opponent. Of course, each of these readymade models would still be subject to projection biases; so which metaphor you choose is mostly a matter of preference. The important point is that deconstructing and analyzing your opponent always begins from the standard model you've assigned for him, derived from your experience of the average player.

#### III

To make a significant departure from our standard model and deconstruct our opponent, we must develop a robust theory of mind. We must learn to put ourselves in our opponent's perspective, and to deduce how he sees the world. The first level of deconstructing our opponent begins with a **psychological profile**. A psychological profile is essentially a generalization about our opponent's psychological tendencies. It points not to particular instances, but to overall patterns in his thinking and perception.

For example, let's say that your opponent, who you've been playing for a while, is raising the river in some spot where he can only represent a runner-runner straight. Say that we've never gotten into this spot with our opponent before, so we don't have any hard data on what he'd do here. Because of that, are we forced to resort to our standard model here?

Not at all&mdash;as poker players, we are able to make psychological inferences into spots we've never seen before (and we naturally do in a match). There are very tenuous profiles that more basic players use, like &ldquo;he's aggressive&rdquo; or &ldquo;he's tight,&rdquo; but we want to develop a more nuanced psychological profile.

There are four main dimensions over which a psychological profile generally spans:

1. Risk-taking behavior
2. Attitude toward complexity
3. Image/momentum sensitivity
4. Attachment to investment

**Risk-taking behavior** is your opponent's willingness to make plays that may fail. It can be generalized especially from your opponent's likelihood to make risky bluffs. There are some bluffs which are universal and don't particularly reflect on this dimension (such as 4-bet bluffing preflop, 3-barreling in obvious spots where you can't have anything etc.). To discern this dimension, focus on spots where a bluff is not mandatory and is high-risk. If your opponent is consistently choosing to take risky bluff spots, or if he is consistently averse to them and most of his bluffs seem to have a pretty low risk threshold, then you can generalize this behavior to many kinds of risk-taking. You can also generalize this from risky, heroic, or creative plays in general. Players who are high on this dimension tend to make more &ldquo;heroic&rdquo; plays, riskier bluffs, FPSy plays, and at times, can care more about making &ldquo;cool&rdquo; plays than optimizing $EV. To extend to the mentions of tilt we discussed before, a player on hot tilt will tend to have increased risk-taking behavior, whereas a player on cold tilt will tend to have depressed risk-taking behavior. Also, players who are playing above their rolls will tend to have lower risk-taking behavior, which is why you are able to generally lean on and steal lots of pots from them, unless they are also concurrently on hot tilt.

The second dimension, **attitude toward complexity**, is how your opponent perceives, and plays with **complex lines** in his game. By complex line, I mean a line that *implies either a trap, or a hand that is not at the top of one's range*. The first type of complex line is one that for the hand you're repping to make sense, you would've had to do something non-straightforward at some point in the hand, such as checking back in a weird place or betting smaller than expected. The other kind of complex line is when you take an intentionally weaker line to rep a medium or low strength hand, as we discussed briefly in Chapter Two.

Attitude toward complexity then, is a measure of how your opponent perceives those complex lines. Most medium-level players tend to over-believe complex lines, precisely because they do not appear as obviously as straightforward bluff lines, and are scarcely practiced at lower stakes. In higher level games, interspersing lines of various complexity becomes much more common, and the dynamic of varying line complexity becomes dense, mature, and nuanced. At lower stakes, however, generally you will find that opponents tend to either over-believe or under-believe lines of high complexity&mdash;a psychological tendency which can be generalized to the rest of their game.

Also note that over-believing or under-believing lines of high complexity tends to be correlated with the belief that people are generally intelligent (under-believers), or that people are not very intelligent (over-believers). The former is likely the kind of player who is going to level himself frequently, convincing himself that people are doing all sorts of things that they aren't. We'll discuss leveling in the next section.

**Image and momentum sensitivity** is, just as it sounds, how aware and how reactive that person is of their image and of the momentum of the match. For example, somebody who is highly sensitive to image will tighten up significantly after losing a big pot (since he thinks you will infer that he's likely to start tilting and trying to get even). Somebody who is less sensitive to image and momentum will be more likely to continue to play aggressively after losing a big pot, either because he's unaware or not paying attention to his image, or because he thinks that you know he's aware of his own image and therefore does not need to react naïvely to it.

Finally, **attachment to investment** is a measure of how much he gets attached to investments he's already made. Somebody who has a high attachment toward investment is going to have trouble folding strong hands even when the board changes; is going to pre-decide whether he's going to bluff in spots, and is less reactive of discouraging information; and is more likely to engage in loss-chasing behavior over a match. This person will often get attached to the belief that &ldquo;they deserve&rdquo; a pot, and will end up making questionable plays to try to claim it. Generally speaking, this is a dimension upon which better and more emotionally robust players will be low, and bad and tilty players will be high. As a note, players who are playing above their rolls will tend to have high attachment to investment, even though they have low risk-taking behavior. That is, even though they will be overly cautious among the spots they choose, when they do choose a spot they will overcommit to pots they invest in, due to how valuable each individual pot becomes to them. This means that generally, once an under-rolled player shows interest in a pot, you should be much more cautious to bluff.

By observing each of these psychological dimensions in your opponent, you can more effectively generalize to a spot that you have never seen before.

For example, say you know your opponent is risk-prone, over-believes complexity, is insensitive to image, and highly attached to investments. If you see him shoves a river trying to represent a runner runner straight after losing a big pot, then you can make a few inferences. First, he's willing to try risky plays, second, that he likely doesn't think you're terribly intelligent, third, that he's not likely to tighten up or react appropriately immediately after losing a big pot, and fourth, that he gets attached to pots and doesn't give them up easily. Even though this shove might be an abnormal bluffing spot for your standard model, the inferences from our psychological profile suggest to us that this is a spot where we can reasonably make a call against such an opponent.

#### IV

Before we can go any further in our analysis of mental models, however, there is one important concept that we have to explore&mdash;and that is **leveling**.

There is probably no word in the poker vocabulary that is more misused, misappropriated, and misunderstood than leveling. People use &ldquo;leveling&rdquo; to justify all sorts of plays, and to explain away all sorts of phenomena. In poker culture, it has effectively evolved into a colloquialism for &ldquo;playing a trick.&rdquo; The word has become so widely used and distorted, that in order to make sense of leveling, we must define it and its limitations very clearly.

Part of the reason why leveling is so misunderstood is because of the linguistic implications of the word. When we talk about &ldquo;levels,&rdquo; as someone being on a &ldquo;higher&rdquo; or &ldquo;lower level,&rdquo; the concept has a distinct verticality to it. You might imagine that someone who's on a lower level as being on the ground, someone on a higher level as being in the sky, and even higher than that, a level above the clouds, and so on and on, like the rising layers of the atmosphere. It's not explicitly stated this way, but this is the metaphorical implication from way the word is used. We imagine great poker players as playing on such fantastically &ldquo;high levels&rdquo; that it would be impossible for us to fathom what was going on between them so high up.

But what is a level exactly? Let's be obvious here. When we choose one &ldquo;level,&rdquo; what we're really choosing is one action, or strategy. When our opponent tries to counter our strategy, the level &ldquo;above that&rdquo; is what counters their counterstrategy. The level &ldquo;above that&rdquo; is the strategy that counters their counterstrategy against our counterstrategy. And above that?

Actually, there is nothing above that.

Let's take an example. Say a drawy board runs out flat, like 4h9h7c2c 2d. There were tons of draws on this board, but they've now missed. Now, if our opponent has the initiative and has been betting every street, and he's shown us that he's fairly risk-prone and investment-attached opponent, then we can say level 1 is for us to call our bluffcatchers, since we expect him to bet here. If our opponent is aware of our perception, he may think we're going to make that inference, so he might counter what he expects our adjustment to be by not bluffing at all. If we preempt this counter by instead calling none of our bluffcatchers, then we can call that level 2. Now, say that he expects us to make this high-level counter, so he switches back to the original strategy to counter this change. That's his level 3, and our level 3 would be to revert back to calling all of our bluffcatchers as well.

You can see here that level 3 and level 1 are actually identical strategies. But what's the difference?

The difference is in terms of ability. It is generally the case that players who play on level 1 will rarely deviate from their level, or play the leveling game with any frequency at all.  Level 1 play is also typified by the fact that it is the play that most bad players make, and requires the least amount of awareness. Level 2 play is of course defined as a counterstrategy to the level 1 play, which makes it the first level adjustment (i.e., the level 2 play exploits a static standard model opponent), but using a level 2 play doesn't necessarily imply a flexibility of switching between levels. A level 2 player will often stay on level 2, consistently exploiting a level 1 player.

So when we say a play is level 3, really what we mean is that it's a *self-aware* level 1, or a masterful level 1. It is someone resorting to the level 1 play, but with the flexibility and knowledge to be able to switch between different levels as the adjustment game requires. And above that?

It makes no sense to talk about a level above level 3. This is a silly idea invented by people who don't understand how adjustment games work. As you can see, theoretically speaking there are only two levels, but we choose arbitrarily to define a first level as the level for people who cannot participate in the leveling game. But to say that somebody is making a &ldquo;level 5&rdquo; play is meaningless. You see, as level 3 is simply a repetition of a level 1 strategy, level 4 is a repetition of level 2 strategy, level 5 is another level 1, and so on.

What really happens at level 3 is that begins a free-flow of gameplay through the level 1 and level 2 adjustment. A &ldquo;level 1 player&rdquo; might never or rarely adjust, and a level 2 player might be said to exploit a level 1 player, and perhaps make a few jerky adjustments, but a level 3 player is fluid, aware, and masterful of how to detect and transition in and out of levels as necessary. In a high-level match, what you will see is interplay between these two levels.

Above all, it is important to know that the leveling game ends. It does not rise into the air, ascending into infinitely higher and higher levels, forever unattainable. It is limited, conquerable, a small arena when you see it clearly. There is nothing special about a high level player such that you are unable to play the leveling game with him, on his &ldquo;level.&rdquo; Once you attain a basic level of mastery, and the arena will be open to you, the very same as it is to the strongest of players.

In essence, the leveling game is a guessing game, like rock-paper-scissors. One guesses what level one's opponent will choose, and makes the proper adjustment to that guess. Thus, it is very similar to gameflow. If we define gameflow as the pattern of different plays, and skill in gameflow to be able to read and predict that pattern, then we can call leveling the pattern of counterstrategies, and skill in leveling to be the ability to predict what pattern of counterstrategies your opponent will choose over time.

But there are only some spots that we call &ldquo;leveling spots.&rdquo; Note that we don't talk about getting leveled in every spot where we make a losing play. We say &ldquo;he leveled me&rdquo; only in certain situations. Why is this?

Generally speaking, there are two kinds of mistakes in poker. **Mistakes of valuation** and **mistakes of psychology**. Valuation is your ability to evaluate the optimal play from a static structure. Mistakes of valuation are therefore choosing suboptimal strategies despite already having all the information. Mistakes of psychology on the other hand are mistakes of incorrectly predicting information which is not already available.

A mistake of valuation is generally a failure of your poker theory. You have not accurately evaluated the ranges, combinatorials, odds, or whatever in making your decision&mdash;but importantly, all of the information is available to make the correct decision. A mistake of psychology on the other hand is one in which we need to infer more information to make a decision against our opponent, and our inference is poor. This is generally characteristic of a &ldquo;leveling&rdquo; spot.

So if you end up 4-bet/calling off ATo against somebody who's not shoving that wide, then we would call that a mistake of valuation. But if someone shoves a river on a dry board when your hand is fairly obvious, and you call and he has it, we would call that a mistake of psychology, or getting leveled.

When we make a claim of an FPSy player that he &ldquo;leveled himself,&rdquo; we now have a vocabulary to state more exactly what that means. To level yourself is to mistake a leveling situation for a non-leveling situation, or to mistake a properly valuational spot for a psychological spot. I.e., usually what you mean when you say &ldquo;you leveled yourself&rdquo; is that the right play was obvious, but you somehow convinced yourself to do the opposite, more psychologically complex play. The correct way to view and solve the situation was using valuational analysis and frequencies (&ldquo;his bluffing frequency is high in this spot, so I'll call&rdquo;), but you incorrectly tried to splice the hand into a singular leveling moment, and face it with your psychological brunt, resulting in an incorrect play.

In essence, a leveling spot must not only be psychological&mdash;it must be binary. You don't say his frequency leveled you, or how his overall strategy leveled you. When we talk about leveling, we are necessarily taking a reductionistic view of poker. We frame the hand as atomic and momentary, and his decision as either X or Y. I will explore this in more detail at the end of this chapter.

For now, let us take leveling for what it is, and use it to probe the next stage of player psychology, which is modeling our opponent's strategic perception.

#### V

So we've developed a psychological profile of our opponent, indicating some of the big patterns in his thinking, and we've looked at how leveling works. But to really be able to predict someone's behavior, we need to really be able to put ourselves into his head, and to see poker through his eyes. This takes more than understanding his large-scale patterns or biases. We need to reconstitute his perception as well, which means we need to know all of the idiosyncrasies of the way he sees the world. This leads us to the next element of opponent modeling, which is modeling our opponent's **strategic perception**.

Strategic perception is simply the sum total of how your opponent evaluates various boards, situations, and so on for their strategic potential. You need to figure out&mdash;where does your opponent think are good spots to bluff? To valuebet? To raise, to fold, and so on? This is different from a psychological profile, which functions using generalizations; we want instead to use very precise empirical methods in reconstituting our opponent's strategic perceptions. This is where observation skills become chiefly important, to ensure that no valuable information is thrown away unwittingly.

There are two main elements of strategic perception: **board texture perception** and **game flow perception**.

 Board texture perception is how your opponent perceives board textures, and the relative weight of each new card to that board. For example, how bad does he think c-betting air is on Js9s5c? Js8s2c? 9s5s2c? How good of a barreling turn card on Qc8s4d does he think Kd is? Ace? Ten? Four?

In reality, there is an objective value to each of these cards and each of these boards in their viability for bluffs or semibluffs. By doing enough math, you could rank each of these in terms of how good they are to bluff in a vacuum. The problem is that everybody learns poker in a different way, and nobody's poker perception is ever perfectly calibrated with mathematics or objective reality. Some people put more or less weight on certain cards, some people are more likely to think they have more fold equity on certain sorts of turns than others, and other people think they always get called in certain spots so they won't bluff. In order to reconstruct your opponent's board texture perception, you must pay close attention to which sorts of flops, turns, and rivers he likes to attack, and how perceptive he is (or how much faith he has) in various bluffing and semibluffing situations.

Moreover, more basic players tend to have what we might call primitive board texture perception. They tend to be unaware of implied semibluffing or bluffing opportunities in repping hands that they don't have, and will overvalue boards of the highcard-flat-flat nature, such as A58r or K55r. They will very rarely consider the possibility of repping turned flush draws or straight draws, or the viability of their hand to turn semibluffing opportunities, and so on.

Of course, in every aspect of evaluating your opponent's strategic perception, you have to think about the second level&mdash;how he perceives your perception. In order to be attuned to this you must always pay attention to what hands have been shown down, what sort of turns you've attacked thus far against your opponent, and which ones you've given up on. This is never a fully precise art, but a good player will always have some idea of what sort of boards he's been attacking and what sorts of boards he's been going easy on. As a match progresses and history builds up, it's essential that you engage in adjustment games on these grounds&mdash;on cards where you think that your image thus far is that you are unlikely to bluff, you must raise your bluffing frequency, and on cards where you've been getting called down often or have shown frequent bluffs or semibluffs, you must slow down and lower your bluffing frequency. Adjustments like these go a long way toward creating edges in a match.

The third level then, is thinking about how your opponent thinks about how you perceive *his* strategic perception. That's a mouthful, but it simply means that he's going to be adjusting based on his own image&mdash;that is, to think on the third level is to track your opponent's adjustments to his board texture tendencies. You should be thinking about what boards you've called down on, where he's failed the most often in bluffing you out of the pot and so is most likely to adjust down, and where you've folded in a lot of spots and so where he is most likely to adjust up. It's important to evaluate all of these with respect to what we might call the **equilibrium of semibluffs**, which simply means to think about how a person's frequency is adjusting relative to a standard frequency of semibluffs, against which one need not make any big adjustments or stray from a likewise equilibrium of standard calldowns. The difficulty in poker is being able to identify these true adjustments and spots where your opponent is likely to adjust, and delineating them from the chaos of poker&mdash;that is, randomness. Your opponent will sometimes get a lot of hands on certain board textures and when you assume he's adjusting positively, instead he is just lucky and getting a lot of hands. Being able to identify these is a difficult art, and overadjusting or underadjusting to these incorrectly perceived adjustments is probably the most common sort of mistake that great players will make. But on the whole, a big part of being able to read an opponent's likeliness of adjustment goes back to the theory of mind&mdash;being able to see how mature and intelligent a player is, how perceptive his mind is in other spots throughout his game, and his overall psychological tendencies, will give you some idea of how likely he is to actually perceive a spot as a point of gameplay and make a good adjustment or never adjust at all.

So the second aspect of strategic perception is **game flow perception**, which simply refers to his perception of various game flow variations. I.e., how does he tend to interpret two bluffs in a row? How does he think you'll interpret two bluffs in a row? After you make a big bluff, does he tend to perceive the next big pot as less likely to be bluff? Again, this boils down in large part to your opponent's standard model of poker players, and also to his own projection bias&mdash;however he tends to perceive those game flow variations, he will often expect other people to perceive them as well.

One must pay attention to both of these elements of one's opponent, and over enough time and with close analysis, you will ideally be able to reconstitute how he perceives poker, and use it to predict his strategic decisions.

#### VI

So we've looked now at a number of levels at which we can analyze our opponent's poker mind, but there is one last concept that I consider of some importance, which is not analyzed much. It's known most commonly as **comfort zone**.

Delineating a player's comfort zone, unlike the empirical analysis of his frequencies, or overall psychological generalizations about his thinking&mdash;figuring out a player's comfort zone is more of an artistic task. To figure out a player's poker comfort zone is to figure out what a player *feels* about certain situations, or what they *like to do* within the field of poker. That is to say, there are certain bluffs that simply feel* wrong *to your opponent, and others that feel *right*. There are certain styles, strategies, or situations that your opponent *enjoys* and others that he does not. Trying to reconstruct how your opponent feels about various bluffing and valuebetting situations is intricately nuanced, and oftentimes difficult to communicate exactly.

As you explore the psychology of a player and start to really understand him, you are likely to see that there are certain bluffing situations which he consistently won't take, even if it seems that with his understanding of poker he should know that's a good spot to bluff. This is an instance of comfort zone getting in the way of a player's strategy.

Comfort zone of course is inversely correlated with centrality&mdash;the more non-central something is for a player, the more it's likely to be outside of his comfort zone. But comfort zones tend to have more to do with certain moves of logic or ways of conceiving of a hand that a player is resistant to. For example, some players will be mentally resistant to certain kinds of thin value bets, to bluffing with certain kinds of hands, to trying to bluff their opponents off hands of a certain strength, or even to make a certain sequence of bluffs in a game flow sequence, and so on. Even if the situation calls for it, and they would be an otherwise capable enough player to determine those things, a small comfort zone may cause a competent player to forego making the optimal play. It is thus essential to see if you can see any patterns in specific bluffs (generally, basic ones) that seem to either give your opponent trouble, or which he resists making. From this, you can derive an idea of what sorts of plays or theoretical moves with which he feels uncomfortable.

For now it will do to mention comfort zones for other players, but in the chapter on creativity and fear we will explore this phenomenon internally, and examine how to deal with it on an individual basis.

There can be said to be three kinds of bluffs in poker&mdash;**fundamentally strong bluffs**, **gameflow bluffs**, and **comfort zone bluffs**. A fundamentally strong bluff is to bluff somewhere where your opponent doesn't have a lot of hands and you do, and therefore can't do much with his range, even if he knows you're bluffing sometimes. A gameflow bluff is a bluff based on your perception that, at this time in gameflow, your opponent wouldn't put you on a bluff (such as perhaps betting twice in a row, he might usually assume your second bet is incidental value). A comfort zone bluff is a bluff where your opponent might have the hands with which to make a call, and gameflow might not be in your favor, but you have the read that your opponent's un-comfortableness will impede him from making such a call. By having a good idea of what makes our opponent uncomfortable, we can better choose spots and bluff more effectively.

Of course, in reality, bluffs aren't neatly divided between these three categories. Most real bluffs will work on multiple levels, or may work well on a couple levels and not as well on the third, and so on. These are merely, in a sense, the three primary modes for where the strength of bluffs are derived.

From here we can arrive at a final maxim of bluffing. *Bluffing is the science of knowing where to bluff, and the art of knowing when your opponent likes to fold*. The science of knowing where to bluff is what we discussed in Chapter Two&mdash;attacking the structurally weaker parts of your opponent's game, i.e. making fundamentally strong bluffs. It is the strategist in you, who studies a blueprint of a fort and plans your assault. The art of knowing when he likes to fold is the psychological game&mdash;knowing his mental tendencies, his comfort zone, and a grasp on the rhythm of gameflow, which allows you to time your bluff when he is likely to believe it and fold to you; i.e., gameflow and comfort zone bluffs. This is the matador in you, the deadly artist, attuned to your senses and the rhythm of action, pulling back the cape at the precise moment. Any excellent bluffer is therefore effective in both the science and the art of bluffing.

We have spoken much of mental models and tools of psychology, but so far we haven't mentioned *how* we acquire information to begin with. That might seem like a simplistic question, but there's more to the matter than first appears. Not only do we need to gather information, but we need to sift the noise out of the information we receive, and then interpret that information by integrating it into our mental models.

The process begins with the gathering of information. When I speak of gathering information of course, I mean something more active than merely playing poker and letting stuff happen for you to react to. Think of information gathering as the art of selective attention. Human beings, by our imperfect nature, will always miss things; some information will always slip through the cracks of our fingers. Our attention and perception are limited. Because of that, we must make a decision as to which elements of a poker match to perceive and focus on, and which to cull from our awareness. Information gathering, then, is also the process of filtering what's important and significant out of all the events in a poker match.

We will speak of stats and their great importance shortly, which play a big role in information gathering and processing.

People are often inclined to believe that there's something special about high level players that makes them especially able to notice, interpret, and utilize the information available to them. That their eyes are somehow more vigilant, more piercing, that perhaps they have some congenital ability to survey and catalogue the details of a poker match better than the rest of us. This is nonsense. If there's one thing I want to do through this book, it is to dispel any idea in your head that there's something &ldquo;special&rdquo; about high level players. There's nothing of the sort.

If high level players can notice tendencies quicker, more accurately, and interpret them better into usable models, it is for two main reasons: first, because of the enormous amount of experience they have had in the realm of psychological model-building, which has optimized their usage and updating of mental models; second and importantly, because they have had so much experience, much of the surface-level phenomena of a poker game are relegated to their unconscious mind, leaving their conscious mind free (and some of their unconscious mind as well) to focus on the psychological game. In other words, it's not that expert poker players &ldquo;are able to focus on more&rdquo; or &ldquo;have more focus,&rdquo; but simply that because they have had so much experience, they are able to spend their conscious focus on other problems. This opens up their conscious attention to pick up on subtle tells, patterns, and valuable pieces of information that a weaker player might never be able to notice.

But I hear you insist, other than gain more experience, what actionable things can you do to actually improve your observation skills? Though skills of observation are largely contingent on brute experience, there are a few things you can do actively to try to improve.

The first thing you can do to improve your observational skill is to focus. This might seem too obvious to be worth stating, but remember, that being focused can be something you can *do*, not simply something you *are*. Certainly, sometimes you will be playing especially focused without having to think about it, or making any conscious effort to be focused. But if I were you, I would not be satisfied with letting my focus as a poker player be decided merely by my internal mental weather. By reminding yourself to focus on your opponent, where your conscious mind might be either inactive (in auto-pilot), or thinking about something else, you will call back yourself back to your opponent. Focus! Remember to focus, and remember that focusing can be something you *do*, and not something you *are*.

When you are observing your opponent, try to pay attention to every spot, and consciously try to generalize what that spot tells you about his play in general. That is, look at specifics, and try to see how they fit into the overall pattern of his strategy or tendencies. Again, this does not happen automatically&mdash;or if it does, it does so very weakly. Force yourself to actively and thoroughly process all of the information you're receiving&mdash;to notice it, interpret it, and update your mental model of your opponent.

One of the best ways to do this is by talking through it (either aloud, or in your head). For example, if you see someone is checking back lots of draws on the turn, tell yourself &ldquo;he is checking back lots of draws on this turn, which means he's fairly risk-averse, he's not semi-bluffing much, his range is strongly weighted toward value, I should be willing to put him on draws by the river,&rdquo; and so on. By doing this consciously, you are imprinting each of these ideas more powerfully on your mind, making it more likely that you will notice, remember, and act in accordance with these observations.

After a certain point&mdash;or rather, continually&mdash;you should be mentally trying to re-figure your perception of your opponent's psychological profile. The more conscious and evidence-based this is, the more you will be able you will be to overcome natural cognitive biases, such as the projection bias, the strength of first impressions, and so on. Rather than &ldquo;I think he's risk-prone,&rdquo; think instead &ldquo;I think he's risk prone because he did X, Y, Z.&rdquo; By engaging in this process continually, your psychological profiling will become more accurate and objective. I will discuss self-talk in more detail in a later chapter, as it's a very important part of the experience of playing poker well and thoughtfully.

Another important element of observation when playing online is note-taking. The art of note-taking is highly subjective, and different things work for different people. For the most part, it doesn't matter *how* you note-take. But what is important is that you take notes consistently, often, and that you use your notes effectively. Ideally, your notes should be doing one of these three things: 1) noting a significant event in your history, such as &ldquo;he called down XYZ with bottom pair&rdquo;, 2) note a psychological read, such as &ldquo;likes to bluff twice in a row,&rdquo; or 3) a note to yourself on how you want to adjust against him, such as &ldquo;next time you get a flush, bet small because he likes to raise small bets.&rdquo; Remember, the value of notes is *not* just in pulling them up and reading them when you feel lost or have forgotten your reads during a big hand. A large part of the reason why note-taking is so valuable is because it strengthens our mental impressions in the first place and makes them easier to remember. It doesn't matter if you never check your notes; the process of continually taking notes will make you remember your reads better, longer, more subconsciously, and the mere *habit* of note-taking will make your conscious mind more engaged and attentive to things worth taking notes on.

Perhaps you've noticed that many great players seem to have tremendous observational skills, but often are unable to articulate &ldquo;how they know&rdquo; what they know about their opponent. If you press them&mdash;how did you make that read? How were you able to so pre-empt his moves? How did you know how this guy thinks? They will shrug their shoulders, and say that they just do. Again, there is nothing special about these players&mdash;nor are they idiot-savants. They simply have relegated most of their observation skills to their subconscious mind rather than their conscious mind. Their automatic brain has been trained into evaluating, synthesizing, and reconstructing their opponents, continuously and very accurately.

I will have more to say on this in the chapter on cognition and self-awareness, but as respectable as it is to be able to have excellent subconscious observation skills, it's not something that you can actively improve or rely upon. You have no control over your subconscious conception of your opponent, other than by focusing your attention upon him. Beyond that, you must use all of the conscious skills at your disposal to break down your opponent&mdash;by self-talk, actively exploring and reformulating his theory of mind, taking notes actively, deliberately working through your sequence of thoughts. If you do this often and consistently enough, slowly over time this process will become automated in your unconscious mind as well.

Make poker, then, about your opponent. Be subsumed in him. Be present alongside him. Watch him, learn from him, prod him and interrogate him for his every strength and weakness, his beliefs and his loves and his fears&mdash;and soon you will be able to predict his thoughts, his actions, and then, with a bit of luck, to rise one step above him. In the end, there is no greater feeling in poker than mastery over an opponent.

#### VIII

One of the biggest revolutions in the theory and understanding of poker has come from the introduction of HUDs and comprehensive stats into online poker. Whether you think on the whole they are good or bad for poker, the fact remains that they have changed the way that we conceptualize and interact with the game. If you are playing online, HUDs are an indispensable tool. Let us look then at stats, how to utilize them in exploiting our opponents, and in playing the adjustment game.

Of course, though I speak as though HUDs and stats are synonymous&mdash;they aren't. Stats are the concrete, mathematical way of representing frequencies and tendencies in poker; HUDS are merely the common way to display them. Although stats were never explicitly accessible in the days before HUDs existed, stats always nevertheless existed. Without HUDs they were simply apprehended less accurately, subject to more potential sway by cognitive biases, with more chance for losing or warping information due to inattention or failure of memory. This is not to mention that bare perception is inherently inaccurate at perceiving frequencies (the mind is not very good at dealing with large numbers, or precise ratios, so somebody with a 7% and a 10% frequency might seem the same to your bare intuition, they actually may mean markedly different things about somebody's range). When we don't have stats, the only way you can perceive anything like frequencies, opening ranges, and so is through your intuitive impressions, along with a few showdowns. One of the great powers then of stats is that they allow us to overcome inherent cognitive biases when it comes to perceiving our opponents. We have been trained through our experience in poker that even if we think somebody is really aggressive or loose, if his stats say he is not, then we trust the stats over our own intuition (since single, salient events tend to influence our intuition more than they should).

In live poker, intuition and observation is the only way to gather information with which to play the adjustment game. But again, even in live poker, stats exist; they are simply not explicitly accessible. It is unimportant whether your conception of stats comes from a HUD or your intuition about how aggressive somebody's been at a live table&mdash;adjustments based on stats are effective due to the structure of poker itself.

First, a word regarding **adjustment schemas**&mdash;adjustment schemas are codified ways in which a player exploits or reacts to certain stats. Each person can have a different adjustment schema that he uses, and there is often more than one way to exploit something, but *our* adjustment schema is *our*system of exploiting and making sense of stats that we employ. I will be showing you in this section a basic adjustment schema for some of the most vital stats, but how you construct your own adjustment schema may depend on your particular style, or preferences.

We always want to conceptualize the adjustment game as beginning from preflop, and moving forward street by street. Preflop, there are a few main stats of importance&mdash;VPIP (voluntarily put money in the pot), PFR (preflop raise), 3-bet, fold to 3-bet, and 4-bet. Note, all of these stats should be interpreted with respect to your standard model, which is generally going to be around the average. Slight deviations from the standard model are mostly irrelevant, so when I say somebody is &ldquo;too loose&rdquo; or &ldquo;too tight,&rdquo; what I mean is that they deviate *significantly* from your standard model (technically, it should mean they're deviating from optimal frequencies, but due to the evolutionary principle, they are effectively going to be centered near to your standard model).

***If somebody is too loose preflop with VPIP and PFR***: in a shorthanded game, there are a few ways we can exploit this. We can either 3-bet him frequently, or call him more in position and put pressure on him postflop, or both. In heads up, an opponent having a high VPIP or PFR on the button is normal and not particularly exploitable, but if they have a high VPIP from out of position, then you can exploit this by simply betting a lot on flops and turns (chances are, there is little you need to do to exploit them if they're doing this, since they'll be hemorrhaging money to you by folding too many flops). If they are loose and attacking lots of flops, then it may be better for you to tighten up your open range, but you must always apply pressure on flops and turns.

***If somebody is too tight preflop with VPIP and PFR***: generally speaking, this is beaten more passively. Against somebody who's very tight, you're simply winning more pots than he is, and that will show up in the long run. In the meanwhile, just play accordingly tight, fold more of the hands you'd call to looser raisers, and respect his flop bets more.

***If somebody has too high of a 3-bet***: in a shorthanded game, again, we can either 4-bet him more liberally, or start calling him more often in position, or both. Note, however, that 4-betting him more often is an **inherent** counter, but calling him is an **implied** counter, meaning that it's possible that if you do not follow through on a proper exploitative strategy, calling him a lot in position will just lose you more money if you play passively. In order for an implied counter to be effective, you must incorporate every element of the counter, which in the case of calling 3-bets, involves floating bets in position, raising flops, and calling down more medium strength hands. In heads up the answer is essentially the same, but with the caveat that this specific adjustment game is much more important in heads up games, since 3-bet pots are a much bigger proportion of the hands played in a heads up match.

***If somebody has too low of a 3-bet***: against this case, simply fold to their 3-bets and give them more respect. By playing a normal strategy where you are 3-betting often, you're simply accruing edges that he isn't.

***If somebody has too high of a fold to 3-bet***: of course, 3-bet this person often.

***If somebody has too low of a fold to 3-bet***: the best adjustment to this tends to be contingent on how passive this person is postflop. If they are highly capable, floaty, and aggressive postflop, then it is often best simply to tighten up 3-bets. But if they are more passive, then it is fine to continue to 3-bet a normal or even wider than normal range against this person, and simply take down lots of pots with flop c-bets. Against weak or passive players who fold too little to 3-bets, taking down undue 3-bet pots is one of the biggest edges you are going to have in a match.

***If somebody 4-bets too much***: the adjustment to this is contingent on whether or not he's actually 4-bet/calling a wider range. Some players will simply 4-bet a higher frequency without widening their 4-bet/calling range to include weaker hands like AJ or AT, medium pairs, etc&mdash;if this is the case, then simply 5-betting wider is the ideal adjustment. If your opponent is widening his 4-bet/calling range, then calling more 4-bets and facing off postflop becomes a better adjustment. 5-betting is the inherent adjustment, and calling 4-bets is an implied adjustment. And of course, if somebody is 4-betting you a great deal then it's best to depress your 3-betting frequency until he relents.

***If somebody 4-bets too little***: 3-bet to your heart's content.

Next, let's look at primary flop stats&mdash;continuation bet, checkraise, and fold to checkraise, and fold to bet (OOP).

***If somebody c-bets too frequently***: against a frequent c-bettor, the first adjustment is to checkraise more often, the second adjustment is to call them with weaker hands (ace highs, low pairs, etc.), and the third adjustment is to float them more often. Obviously, floating is always an implied adjustment, and must be done intelligently for it to be effective. However, unlike what some players seem to believe, leading a wider range OOP is not a counter to a high c-betting frequency. An OOP leading range does not actually counter anything, other than somebody who is really bad at dealing with OOP leads (which is great, but is more along the lines of experimentation than adjustment games), it simply circumvents the c-betting game by creating a different dynamic. While I have nothing against OOP leading, if you are OOP leading in response to frequent c-bettors, then you are mistaking an adjustment for circumvention, and there is a good chance you might increase your EV by simply letting him c-bet, and exploiting it.

***If somebody c-bets too infrequently***: this can be tricky. In some cases, if the player is very good, then there's not a lot that you can do to exploit this, since he will be well balanced and intelligent in the way he arranges and uses his handrange on the flop and turn. But against a weaker player, you will automatically exploit his passivity by simply winning far more pots than him in position. Respect this player's c-bets and checkraise him less. Against this kind of player, I more strongly encourage OOP leading&mdash;note, not because it exploits infrequent c-betting, but because his passive strategy indicates a risk-averse psychological profile. Therefore, if you're pumping up pots and implying that he'll have to face more aggression against you, it is possible that he may play very poorly and not put enough pressure on OOP leads.

***If somebody checkraises too frequently***: against a frequent checkraiser, you're going to want to lower your flop c-bet frequency by checking back more weak hands (both air and vulnerable pair type hands), 3-betting his checkraises more often with both value and bluffs, and floating some of his checkraises. Floating is the implied counter, so you must play aggressively on the turn as well, or double float if necessary.

***If somebody checkraises too infrequently***: this can be tricky&mdash;you have to see what particular style this is paired with. If somebody is checkraising infrequently and calling a lot, that means that he is floating you a lot out of position, and calling lots of high card hands. Against this, you can simply increase your turn and river barreling frequency. If he is checkraising infrequently but simply folding a normal or slightly less than normal amount, then it's likely that he's slowplaying more strong hands that most players would be checkraising with, so be wary of that on the turn. If he's checkraising infrequently and folding often, then he's just burning his own money, so you don't need to do anything other than keep c-betting a lot.

***If somebody folds to checkraises too frequently***: Checkraise him a lot. Easy.

***If somebody folds to checkraises too infrequently***: Checkraise him tighter, weight your range with value hands, and barrel more turns and rivers, since he's going to be floating you more or simply calling you down lighter. Against a passive player who is going to fold flimsy hands under pressure easily, you may even keep an elevated checkraising range if he's simply spewing money by folding lots of turns with bottom pairs or things like that.

***If somebody folds to bets OOP too frequently***: Bet a lot OOP with bluffs.

***If somebody folds to bets OOP too infrequently***: Don't bet much OOP without hands.

Now, as hands move into the turn and river, they get more complex, and more interconnections develop between different stages of a hand (i.e., how is he playing his draws to get here? What sorts of hands was he using to bluff with on the flop? Where is he allocating most of his value hands?). In short, one must use a holistic analysis of handranges, and figuring out what hands your opponent can and can't have based on the overall structure of his game. But the principles as suggested in preflop and flop play, remain largely the same.

#### IX

I've outlined a basic hierarchy of important stats by which to interpret the adjustment game, but before we move on, let us meditate briefly on the adjustment game and its implications.

What, after all, is the adjustment game?

If you think about it, the adjustment game is simply the name we give to the shifting of frequencies, the way that strategies ebb and flow, wax and wane in reaction to one another. It is the strategic weather, the continually changing winds of exploitation.

But there is an element of poker that escapes the adjustment game. Recall how in the discussion about holism and reductionism in gameflow, we talked about how a frequency could be understood as one whole large-scale strategy, but also could be atomized, sub-divided into infinitesimal, discrete parts. Can we say the same of the adjustment game?

The adjustment game works a little differently. There are certainly some parts of the adjustment game which hinge solely on stats, and on large-scale strategy. That is, there are certain spots where we feel like we can say for sure that we are making a **range-based decision**. A range-based decision is one that is justified solely by large-scale reasoning. For example, say that after c-betting, you pick up a flush draw on the turn. This is a spot where semibluffing the turn is not a complex decision that hinges on psychology, or getting into your opponent's head, or trying to outthink him. This bet is relegated to purely stats-based, or range-based justification. You simply bet here because he'll fold enough, and you'll make enough hands on the river, and so on. Psychology never comes into it.

When you start looking for such spots, you might find that the vast majority of poker is comprised of them. There are even some spots where to make a big call on the river, or to make a big bluff doesn't really ever congeal into a &ldquo;psychological moment,&rdquo; but you merely make them because you can mathematically justify it.

But what happens when you cannot? What of the times when your range-based abstractions aren't enough? When you truly don't know what's going to happen?

Recall the diagram of the circle of centrality. 

![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aXB6gLdLdg4/T9MDy50gofI/AAAAAAAABQ8/NwZmE3OCyJo/s1600/central.png)

Instead of thinking of this as the circle of centrality, the same metaphor applies to a circle of comfort. If the field of all possible moves is the rectangle, then we can also say that the circle in the middle of contains all of the lines, actions, and betsizes that your opponent is comfortable with, which he believes are &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;solid&rdquo; plays. That is the domain of poker moves that is available to him; that he feels are &ldquo;right.&rdquo;

Part of your job as a poker player is to figure out the circle he has drawn, and then to step outside of it. Encircle him, such that the only way he can adjust to your strategy, the only way he can make the right play, is by doing something that he doesn't think he can do. To break the circle of his understanding, his skill, his comfort.

After all, another way of saying that certain plays are outside of your opponent's comfort zone, is to say that they are plays that he genuinely doesn't see as options. His schema of poker precludes him from doing those things. Figuring out, then, how your opponent's poker schema is limiting him is integral to maximally exploiting him in the psychological game.

In short, if you push him somewhere where he's not willing to go, he will not follow you.

I call this **momentous aggression**. Momentous aggression is not merely being aggressive, or raising and betting a lot. It is not a matter of frequency. It is more than that.

A range-based decision is fighting with your range, constructing an optimal frequency, finding a holistic solution to the problem you face. But a momentous decision is a fixed, reductionistic event. It is to decide that your opponent has one hand. One state of mind. It is to try to completely, in this hand, outplay him. Where range-based decision says his bluffing frequency is high enough that I can justify a call, a momentous decision says&mdash;my opponent is choosing either level 2 or level 3, and I choose 2, because I think that's the right one.

The further out of the circle of centrality you push your opponent, the more momentous your aggression is likely to become. Where non-central spots require reductionistic thinking, spots with high centrality are more likely to recruit holistic thinking. This is in part because non-central spots are processed more slowly and deliberately, and therefore require more conscious thought, and there is much less empirical data to begin with regarding non-central spots, with which to make logical inferences.

You could say that the reductionistic approach is thinking from hand-to-hand, but that's something of an oversimplification. To play a hand reductionistically is in a more philosophical sense, to face the moment as singular, rather than merely a cog in a larger system. It is to stop everything else, to arrest the gears of the mind, and to resolve the problem in one fell motion. You must think reductionistically when the spot you face is big enough, deep enough, and non-central enough. It is no longer enough to say &ldquo;this is exploitable,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I can choose a better spot,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I have some better hands here so I don't have to do anything with a hand this weak.&rdquo; Excuses fall short. Your opponent has forced you to a decision from which you cannot step aside. Of course, it may be a decision for all your chips, but it's more than that. It's creating a situation where your decision cannot be relegated to range-based justifications.

Aggressive players may force you to play lots of large pots, but a great player will force you to make decisions with the full resolve of your mind. He will put the force of your poker game behind every big call and big fold that you make. When you play a great player, you will feel as though you're not allowed to make a mistake. You're not allowed to run or turn away from a decision. Every clash is a test. Every punch must either be absorbed or countered. There is no room to run.

It is a species of aggression that is more ferocious than trying to win a lot of pots. Some aggressive low or mid-stakes players may be annoyingly tenacious, but this can be dispatched easily with some large-scale adjustments. Momentous aggression is different. The aggression you see at high stakes is aggression that plants seeds of fear into your mind.

What does he have? What does he think I'm going to do? The world telescopes into one ponderous moment, and the action is on you. This is why I call it momentous aggression&mdash;momentous aggression culminates in those big, time-frozen, everything-happening-at-once moments. This is the nature of aggressive high level play.

This concludes of our analysis of our opponents' psychology. But in continuing our exploration of the philosophy of poker, psychology must now turn inwards, to analyzing ourselves and the way our own minds function. Next, we will look at cognition and self-awareness as it relates to the experience of thinking about, and playing poker, and understanding the way our own minds function.

Hey all,
 Looks like I was late on my update again, haha. Sorry.

A week per chapter, it turns out, is pretty brutal when you're taking full time classes five days a week with lots of reading and essays to do. This chapter also required research in order to write and structure it effectively, but I think I can stand by it pretty confidently. If I had to say, I think this is perhaps one of the most valuable chapters in the book.

Mental coaching is going along well. I've recently started reading through the *Routledge Handbook of Applied Sport Psychology*, which occupies an interesting space in its application to poker theory. A lot of the methods and techniques discussed therein I was already aware of, but there are some really interesting insights and experiments. I'm going to try to apply some this stuff to my mental coaching where I can as well. [Once again, you can contact me at [haseebcoach@gmail.com](mailto:haseebcoach@gmail.com)if you're interested in mental coaching.]

Life is chugging along. Right now I'm taking a class on fiction writing and on the art of the short story, which are both endlessly fascinating. But it'll be nice when the summer term ends. In the fall semester my load will be a lot lighter, so I'll have more time to devote to other pursuits, especially to physical training and writing projects. But I want to try to get all the chapters of this book finished ideally before the end of September. I don't know how feasible that is, but I'm going to do my best. Feel free to push and prod me however you can! I respond well to guilting, haha.

#### I

In Plato's *Phaedrus*, Socrates accounts his infamous allegory of the charioteer. According to his allegory, man's soul is seated at the head of a chariot, driven by two winged horses. The first is a white horse, &ldquo;whose breed and character are noble,&rdquo; while the second, a black horse, is the opposite&mdash;brash and temperamental. These two are portrayed as locked in an eternal struggle, like good and evil, pulling the chariot each in their own direction, perpetually thwarting one another forever. The noble horse, of course, is Reason, or Rationality. The ignoble horse is Passion, or Emotion. The idea predates even Plato&mdash;it has long been believed that that reason and emotion are fundamentally opposed.

Is that right? Is emotion the opposite of reason? What is the relationship of poker to emotion?

It turns out that the common dichotomy between reason and emotion is the wrong one to make. The relationship is more complex than one of diametric opposition.

But what we can say is that, at least in poker, reason *is* the goal. We do want to follow the horse of rationality, to give it as much control over our chariot as we can. But what deters against that path is not emotion, but rather *irrationality*.

It is misguided to frame the struggle chiefly against emotion. I say instead, *poker is the battle against human irrationality.*

What do I mean by this? Hopefully this will begin to make sense over the following two chapters.

But first, one cannot wage a war without knowing one's enemy. In order to understand irrationality and its sources, we must delve into the way our own minds work, and how our mental processes operate within the context of poker.

#### II

Let us begin by framing the way the brain functions. This is not going to be a rigorous explanation of neuroscience&mdash;although that is an interesting and important topic, a thorough study of it would be unnecessary for our purposes. Instead, I will provide a very cursory framework for how the brain works.

The basic unit of the brain is the **neuron**. Each neuron is connected to other neurons through large networks, known as **neuronal networks**. These networks are formed by many individual neurons forging inter-connections, each of which can be either strengthened or inhibited by how often they signal to other nearby neurons. Two neurons will be strongly connected if they signal one another repeatedly. It is on this basis that neuronal networks of increasing complexity are formed.

This strengthening and inhibition of neuronal connections emerges in higher-level behavior as the concept in classical psychology known as **conditioning**. There are two main forms of conditioning&mdash;**classical conditioning**, when two stimuli are mentally associated with another, creating an expectation or reflex, and **operant conditioning**, when the behavior's consequence, either positive or negative, reinforces or inhibits that behavior accordingly. Conditioning is one of the basic ways in which we learn high-level behaviors.

Not all neuronal networks or systems of behavior are created or learned from scratch, however. There are many functions which exist in pre-programmed **modules** of the brain. For example, the regulation of your internal organs, your sensory perception, and your survival instincts all come without having to be learned. But there are other parts of our brain which are highly **plastic**, and therefore are very changeable in structure.

Let's zoom out and look at **cognition**&mdash;that is, thinking. For our purposes, there are two main forms of cognitive errors we must aware of: **learned errors**, and pre-cognitive or **inherent errors**. Learned errors are generally easier to correct, having been learned, they can be un-learned by the very same neuronal mechanisms of reinforcement and inhibition&mdash;but inherent errors are more tricky. They are often embedded deep into the structure of our cognitive modules. We generally call these inherent, usually universal cognitive errors **cognitive biases**.

Don't worry, we're going to end it there. (I could feel you starting to sweat.)

It is vitally important to understand the nature of how the brain functions, or at the very least to keep these structural blueprints in mind. Although the brain is vastly more complex, and is composed of many more components than the aforementioned, it is nevertheless the case that almost all of the vastness of human experience, intelligence, and action comes just from neurons firing, signaling each other, simply from strengthening and inhibiting their mutual interconnections. It is magnificent, mysterious, and mesmerizing to consider.

This is also where all of poker comes from. The game of poker, after all, is not simply a game played with 52 cards on a board and so on&mdash;it is a game played among humans. That is, we are part of the game of poker as it is actually played. And so the game does not end with the cards. The game lifts off the table, and continues on into our brains. To understand poker, you must understand the way *we*operate, the way that we think, reason, bargain, and occasionally fail.

So, as we move forward, when we think about learning, about cognition, about emotion, about strengthening and extinguishing habits, I encourage you to keep this framework in mind. Of course, it is impossible for us (not to mention for neuroscientists) to intelligibly reduce cognition to a mere network of neurons, but nevertheless, these concepts will help you to make sense of the patterns and logic that underlies the way that cognition functions. What is after all composed of neurons must be understood and treated with respect to that composition.

#### III

The term &ldquo;the unconscious mind&rdquo; has acquired unfortunate connotations in intellectual history. It is almost impossible to talk about the unconscious mind, so phrased, without thinking about Freud. The term has become loaded with notions of repression, secret motivations, sexual obsessions for family members, castration complexes, and a host of other pseudoscientific sensationalisms. Freud of course has long since been repudiated as scientifically unsound, to say the least. But the unconscious mind that he proposed is nevertheless very real, albeit in a different way than he originally imagined it.

I want you to think of the unconscious mind then, not as some repressed, angst-ridden alter ego that wants to eat junk food and have sex with your mother. As charming as that idea is, there's little evidence that something of that sort actually exists.

What we want to do instead is draw a distinction between the **conscious mind** and **unconscious mind**. Defining consciousness is notoriously difficult, and there's no need to get lost in the bogs of language and philosophy here. Let us simply say that the conscious mind is the part of your mind that *you are aware of*, and *over which you have direct control*. The unconscious mind then is the part of your mind of which you are not aware, over which you have no control, which governs automatic processes, actions, and thoughts.

The way that most people conceive of their own minds and the way they work (often termed &ldquo;pop psychology&rdquo;) is, by and large, misguided and erroneous. Admittedly, for most people, it's fine to be somewhat wrong about the way your brain functions; there are worse things to be ignorant of. But if you want to be a first-rate poker player, it is essential that you understand the way your brain works, since it is the final interface between yourself and the game.

The first major point is this: the mind is not one continuous thing. It is disparate, composed of many different parts, separated not just in space but in circuitry. Your conscious mind, along with its constructs, is only one element out of many that compose your mental circuitboard.

There are many classical psychological experiments to demonstrate the disparateness of the brain. The classic example, which was once the treatment for intractable epilepsy, is that if you sever the corpus callosum in a patient (the bridge between the two hemispheres of the brain) you see very dramatic effects. In these &ldquo;split-brain&rdquo; experiments, if an image is shown to the left eye only, the subject is unable to vocally name what he or she is seeing. This is because the speech-control center is generally located in the left hemisphere of the brain (the left visual field is sent to the right side of the brain; the opposite side). Because severing the corpus callosum has cut off communication between the two sides of the brain is inhibited, the patient is unable to name what he is seeing&mdash;but he seems to still recognize the object. If asked to pick up and grasp it, he will be able to do so. So he can touch and manipulate the object, but cannot access its name if it's located in its left visual field&mdash;but once the object moves to his right visual field, he has no problem.

This is of course only the tip of the iceberg. Although direct experimentation on functioning human brains is impossible (that is, unethical), we have learned a great deal about the way the brain functions through incidental experiments&mdash;i.e., due to the accumulation of information through accidents and injuries, there has been at least one patient at some point in medical literature who has had their brain damaged in every imaginably specific way. By seeing how somebody who has had only one segment, or another segment of their brain damaged, and then seeing how it in turn affects their behavior, we have gained great insights into how the brain functions, and how modular it is (that is, how different parts control different highly specialized functions).

Other telling examples can be seen in aphasias (impairments in language processing)&mdash;for example, Broca's aphasia, in which a subject becomes unable to form and comprehend sentences, although they can still understand the meaning of individual words. Or on the other hand, Wernicke's aphasia, in which the subject can speak perfectly, but becomes unable to make sense of any language he perceives, whether heard or read. These phenomena show that there are very specialized modules of the brain that pertain to highly specific elements of language function.

The more we learn about the brain, the more we see how fragmented it is. Evolutionary biology sheds even more light on this, as we see how our brains developed out of reptilian and neo-mammalian brain architecture. The neo-cortex, the seat of consciousness, cognition, and &ldquo;rationality,&rdquo; is the newest addition to our brain structure, but much of our movement, behavior, and so on is already regulated by non-conscious structures of our brain. Consciousness is, in a sense, a late-comer. For pre-human mammals and proto-humans, chances are, consciousness was very much an epiphenomenal byproduct that played a smaller role in their brain processes than it does for us *Homo sapiens sapiens*.

Another telling example is the phenomenon known as blindsight. Blindsight is a rare neurological phenomenon that occurs in subjects who have had damage to their primary visual cortex, such that they believe they are blind and claim to have no conscious experience of vision. However, when presented with visual stimuli and forced to *guess* the location, or movement of a visual stimulus (such as a red square on a screen), even though they will insist that they have no awareness of any visual perception, they will wind up making very accurate guesses. This is a striking finding. It demonstrates that these subjects they have severed the connection between their consciousness and their visual apparatus, nevertheless their unconscious brain is still processing and responding to visual information&mdash;even to the extent that they can competently manipulate and grab objects that they claim to have no visual awareness of.

So what is consciousness? I want you to seriously imagine this now. Consciousness is this newly arisen faculty in your mammalian brain. Centralized in your neo-cortex, it is continuously synthesizing your sense perceptions, your emotions, your memory and your cognition into one seamless experience. But as effective of a flashlight (and abacus) as consciousness proves to be for the outside world, why should you assume it would be one for your interiority as well? Why should you assume that consciousness is designed to perceive the vast unconscious circuitry of your brain? In fact, what little of the rest of your brain it perceives, the conscious mind filters through its own concepts and frameworks. Evolutionarily, there is little need for more than that. And as your consciousness is busily chugging away, the rest of your brain is involved in all manner of other neuronal activity, in the hurried business of keeping you alive and functioning.

Here is the second important conclusion: the conscious mind, then, is separated from the other vital elements of the brain not because of some failure on our own part, ignorance, lack of self-reflection, or anything of the sort. In reality, we are not aware of the rest of our brain *by virtue of the architecture of the brain itself*. It is not our &ldquo;fault.&rdquo; It simply is the way it is. Our conscious experiences are negotiated primarily through our neo-cortex, yet we feel like our conscious selves must be &ldquo;who we are.&rdquo; But in fact, our brain is comprised of many more elements than the conscious part, and by extension, we are ourselves much more than our conscious minds.

#### IV

One of the greatest mistakes that a thinker can make is what I call **the conscious fallacy**. The conscious fallacy is the mistake of equating oneself with one's conscious mind, and assuming that as long as one is fully oneself, that one will retain the level of consciousness that one has when one formulates the intention to do something. In other words, to commit the conscious fallacy is to misunderstand the role of consciousness in our mental life. The reality is, most of our lives are navigated unconsciously.

What do I mean by this?

It might sound like I'm suggesting that we spend our lives in a walking daze, unaware of the truth of what's going on around us. Perhaps the sort of thing you'd expect to hear from a conspiracy theorist.

Actually, in a profound sense, it's true.

Most people still believe in what's called the &ldquo;mind-body&rdquo; divide (even if they don't believe it explicitly, this is subconsciously the theory they operating with). They believe that they are a mind (or a soul) inhabiting and controlling a body&mdash;the &ldquo;ghost in the shell.&rdquo; This idea would give you the impression that you are continuously in control of yourself, and therefore any mental failing would be attributable to your conscious agency. Well, if you want to identify &ldquo;self&rdquo; as your *conscious* self, then in a very real way, in biological terms &ldquo;you&rdquo; are only one among numerous participants in your mental life.

In other words, to take full account of &ldquo;yourself,&rdquo; you must also consider the unconscious elements of your mind as part of that equation.

Have you ever told yourself you were going to do something in the future, and felt completely sure you were going to do it&mdash;yet when the moment came, you ended up not following through? Here's an obvious example. Say you tilted off a lot of money, and in the aftermath of your session, you tell yourself: &ldquo;the next time that I'm down 4 buyins, I'm going to quit my session immediately. No ifs, ands, or buts.&rdquo; You feel completely sure, with all the resolve of your mind, that you will do this next time. After all, you are in control of yourself, and you *want* to do it. Why wouldn't you? But when the moment comes, you keep playing past four buyins, and tilt again.

This is the conscious fallacy. You presume, because in that moment your conscious mind is dominating your mental life, that in future points in time it will also dominate. Of course, there's no reason for that to be the case, especially so in situations like tilt, when your limbic (emotional, unconscious) brain is agitated. In order to overcome the conscious fallacy, you must recognize that full conscious command of your faculties is not the norm, but the *exception*in human life, and to *plan* for that.

This sort of thing happens not just in poker. It occurs in every facet of your life. Again and again, you expect things of yourself, believing deep down in some kind of continuous agency, some deep belief that &ldquo;you&rdquo; are really in control. But the truth (and hopefully you have probably learned this by now) is that your conscious mind is not enough. Not in the sense that *your* conscious mind isn't strong enough; but more specifically, that the conscious mind *itself*is not strong enough. Nor is it a matter of willpower, or &ldquo;mind over matter.&rdquo; You are logistically, biologically, neuronally constrained. Your conscious mind is not running the show, although it is naturally convinced that it is.

This sounds pretty pessimistic, doesn't it? Perhaps it sounds like there's nothing we can do. How can we progress from such a fatalistic premise?

Despite all of this, you are not willing to cede control. Do you want to improve at poker? Do you want to be the best? Then you must then take hold of the mantle, in spite of these facts. Abandon, as much as you can, your sense of association with your purely conscious mind. You are not just your conscious mind. You are *your entire mind*&mdash;your conscious mind is only your most active and fluid negotiator. Your goal then, is to condition your unconscious mind by training it through whatever means available to you, in order to cultivate the abilities you need as a poker player.

This conditioning and shaping is *led* by the conscious mind. After all, it is the only part of yourself over which you have meaningful control. But ironically, although it is very good at helping you to change your external environment*, your conscious mind is not very effective at altering your unconscious mind*. Having hopes, desires, and expectations is all well and good&mdash;but your unconscious mind doesn't care, or is often oblivious&mdash;that neuronal network is going to sit there and keep doing its own thing, largely un-phased by your desires. This puts us in something of a catch-22. Our conscious mind wants us to change, but our conscious mind alone can't change us; it's only good at changing external things.

This is the essence of the conscious fallacy. It is mistaking the conscious mind's ability to act on external objects as an ability to affect the unconscious mind&mdash;at which it's pretty poor.

So in a sense, we cannot affect ourselves directly. But we still want to be our own masters. So what do we do? Well, we must be a little sneaky.

Instead of expecting your conscious thoughts to change your unconscious mind, you must be circuitous. By co-opting your *environment*, which you *can* change, you can use the environment to train your unconscious mind in the direction of how you want to alter it. Thus, the goal in conscious self-development, in poker as in everything else, is mediated through the environment. We create the *environment* that cultivates our growth, more than merely trying to consciously strong-arm that growth ourselves.

The &ldquo;ghost in the shell&rdquo; metaphor is not a bad one. But like all ghosts, consciousness is not visible all the time&mdash;it only comes out at odd hours, when the conditions are just right. What do we do the rest of the time, when our conscious mind, with its desires, intentions, its &ldquo;rationality,&rdquo; has dissipated? Well, by creating an environment that mirrors its desires, intentions, and expectations, we create an emissary for it&mdash;the ghost of the ghost, which lives on when our conscious mind disappears, continuing to influence and change the animal mind of our unconscious.

So the first goal is to create the conditions for growth by consciously changing one's environment. The second is to understand your entire mind-system; not merely your conscious mind (which is immediately and easily accessible through introspection), but your unconscious mind as well. Survey honestly your unconscious habits, tendencies, and proclivities, and only then will you be able to work to overcome your weaknesses.

#### V

You may have noticed the suspicion with which I use terms like &ldquo;rationality&rdquo; and &ldquo;reason.&rdquo; There is an old idea that we as human beings are the exemplars of Rationality, the stewards of Reason&mdash;a notion that can be traced back chiefly to the Enlightenment. By now, those ideas have become outdated. The accumulation of psychological research over the last 150 years has shown us more and more how truly far from rational we humans are, by our very nature.

Again, the most fruitful perspective to take is one of evolutionary psychology. Instead of taking the brain as a perfected tool for instantiating our rationality, let us instead think of the brain and its functions as having evolved to fulfill some evolutionary need. Therefore, what we should expect is *not*rationality in and of itself, but whatever it is that would help us best survive. If the brain simply evolved to help us survive (in the environments in which primitive humans and proto-humans would've inhabited), then it should come as no surprise that there are many finer aspects of rationality and logical thinking for which the brain is not intrinsically attuned.

Of course, we must take our brains for what they are. They are all we have. But as tools for thinking, *they are inherently flawed.* Our brains tend toward errors&mdash;errors that may have served some purpose (or may have been inconsequential) in their times, and may even serve some purpose now. But in more intellectually rigorous contexts such as poker, these errors are detrimental to us. The only way to avoid these is to inform ourselves of them, to be aware of them, and to try to overcome them through the conscious oversight of our mental life.

There are two main notions we want to consider here. The first is **bounded rationality**. Bounded rationality is the idea that rationality, as it's available to humans, is bounded by three factors: the information available to a person, the cognitive limitations of their mind, and the amount of time available to them in making a decision. Although we might desire some theoretical ideal of &ldquo;perfect Rationality,&rdquo; which takes into account all of the possible factors, weights them perfectly, and indifferently applies inferences to choose the best option&mdash;human beings do not and cannot do that. It's simply not how we make decisions. Therefore, the best version of rationality *to which we can realistically aspire* is a boundedly rational one. &ldquo;True&rdquo; rationality is a fantasy; it doesn't exist. The best we can do is only a partial version of rationality, as approximated by our mental apparatus, and time constraints.

The second notion, one we've already encountered, is what's come to be known as the **cognitive bias**. Cognitive biases are consistent patterns of widespread cognitive errors which occur in specific situations for most human beings. Again, cognitive biases are best interpreted as evolved mental behaviors. We would do well to assume there is some discernible advantage as to why these biases manifest in our cognition in the way that they do.  For example, it may be that they are beneficial to cultural or emotional well-being (such as the in-group bias or the egocentric bias), or because they function as heuristics, allowing us to make ordinary decisions much faster and more efficiently.

There are many values which evolution seems to have privileged over rational integrity, such as speed, efficiency, and obviously survival. This has the result that our evolutionary evolved cognition sometimes prefers convenient delusions over reality. But we are poker players, and the values for which evolution selects, and the values for which poker selects, are different.  Poker values indifference and cold rationality. There is no space for delusion in poker&mdash;the closer we get to reality, the closer we get to true and objective renditions of the external world and of ourselves, the better we can become as poker players. This is the irrationality we must fight against. So in order to approach that level of reasoning, we must resist some of the natural inclinations of our faulty cognition. Let us then analyze cognitive biases with respect to that.

There are several major cognitive biases that every poker player should be wary of. The first bias is the **anchoring bias**. The anchoring bias simply states that if an idea is presented to your mind, *even in a totally irrelevant context,* it will &ldquo;anchor&rdquo; your subsequent cognition near the vicinity of that idea.

For example, say we take two test groups, and we make the first test group write down the number *1000* on a piece of paper, and ask the second test group to write the number *10*&mdash;noting to each that the number they've written is completely arbitrary and irrelevant&mdash;and then we ask them each to guess how much the average guided tour of London costs. The first group will consistently *guess a significantly higher number than the latter group*, simply because they wrote a larger number *in a completely irrelevant context*. In other words, their later cognition was, unbeknownst to them, &ldquo;anchored&rdquo; around the number they had previously encountered, and the number that they guessed was swayed in that direction. If you think about the structure of the brain, perhaps this makes a bit of sense&mdash;when neurons become activated, nearby neurons are more likely to be activated as well, and the neurons which go into thinking up larger numbers are nearer to one another than those for smaller numbers. This bias shows us that the order and way in which your neurons are activated *profoundly* affect the way you think.

You might ask, what does this have to do with poker? A lot, actually&mdash;the anchoring effect manifests in poker talk, as well as in gameplay. Of the former, I will discuss later, in the chapter on the poker community. As for the latter, let me provide an obvious example. Say that you are playing a player who's tilting badly, who constantly makes suicide bluffs, and who's just throwing his stack into the most unorthodox spots where no one else bets, and you're calling him down easily. You stack him, he leaves, and some other regular joins, and let's say you get to a similar river spot as one in which the tilter made a ridiculous suicide bluff. Guess what the anchoring bias would predict?

Of course&mdash;and you can probably intuit this. You're more likely to call, even though what happened with a *previous opponent* is completely and utterly irrelevant to how this opponent plays; for some reason you're just more able to imagine him as bluffing in this spot. It's simply easier to call. This is the anchoring bias in effect. There are many other ways to get yourself into such a mental space&mdash;analyzing a hand, talking about poker, imagining a hand, reviewing an old session, watching a video, or even engaging in something away from the poker table that makes you think about &ldquo;aggression&rdquo; or &ldquo;passivity&rdquo; or whatever&mdash;all of it has the potential to irrationally affect your decisions.

Of course, we can't sanitize our minds from everything. To a certain degree, we must simply accept this bias, as we must with many of these biases&mdash;they are inherent to our mental architecture, and we must learn to live with them. But being aware of them, especially in obvious cases as in the example I showed you, we can try to consciously counteract them somewhat, and try to force ourselves into a more objective frame of mind.

We've already discussed the **projection bias** (see [chapter 3, section IX](https://haseebq.com/the-philosophy-of-poker-chapter-3-psychology-and-the-art-of-randomness/)).

Another bias of note is the **innumeracy bias**. The innumeracy bias refers to our inability to accurately process very large or very small numbers using our intuition, or to effectively compute cumulative probabilities in our heads. In poker, this can be a fatal mistake. The most obvious example is when it comes to exploitation. People tend to overvalue winning or losing big pots, and tend to assume that if they are winning or losing the big pots, that determines if how much they're exploiting their opponents. The swings immediately after big pots are very salient, of course. But first-rate players know that often times, your biggest edge comes from taking down lots of small and medium sized pots, which over a few hundred hands, often comes to equal more than what you're winning or losing in big pots. This is simply by slow accrual, which your brain is *not* intuitively designed to perceive.

The brain is also very bad at grasping risk/reward situations which rely on close margins. For example, in a spot where you're bluffing 3/5 pot on the river with a missed draw and he's bluffcatching you 60% of the time on the river, *your brain is likely to intuitively make you feel like this is a bad play*. This is in no small part because you are losing more than half of the time, which means more than half the time your brain experiences a negative event. As it happens, your brain is pretty bad at &ldquo;grading&rdquo; these negative events&mdash;meaning, you don't feel appropriately better or worse depending on what odds you were given on your negative event or what margin of EV you were capturing. The brain is not *designed* to deal in terms of such numbers&mdash;but that is precisely what poker requires of us. The reality is, of course, that for a 3/5 pot bet, you need 37.5% fold equity to break even, so if he's folding 40% of the time you're netting EV. In order to be able to routinely capture such close (or deceptive) margins of EV, you have to try to train your intuitive, unconscious mind to become more in line with your conscious understanding of odds and probabilities. If you force yourself into more situations where you're capturing a close margin of EV, yet losing more than half the time, your unconscious mind will gradually start to catch up. (This bias becomes even more pronounced when it comes to something like having a 10% chance to win 15x your investment and 90% chance to lose it, but this is less of an issue in poker.)

A closely related cognitive bias is the **loss aversion bias**. Simply stated, the loss aversion bias points toward people being inherently irrational with regards to taking risks&mdash;they overvalue averting losses, and undervalue new gains. For example, if you're in a 300bb pot, and you have 200bb behind with which to bluff shove the river, and you think that he's folding 50% of the time&mdash;what do you think you'd do here? Turns out, the majority of people check back, even with that assumption, because their mind is inherently biasing them toward keeping what money they have. The 200bb they already have feels more valuable than the 300bb in the middle. Another way of saying this is that losing 200bb hurts more than winning the 300bb in the middle feels good. Losing feels worse than winning feels good.

The reality of course is that, in most cases, every dollar should be equal to every other dollar. A dollar gained should be equally as good as a dollar lost is bad.

This bias is one of the most difficult to overcome, because ultimately, emotion plays a huge role in how we make internal decisions in poker&mdash;not simply in terms of strategy, but also in terms of how we play, when we play, and who we play. But to combat this bias, you must force your rational mental processes to overcome and influence your unconscious mind. If you tell yourself&mdash;it's okay that I lost two buyins, because I had a good shot at three buyins that was hugely +EV&mdash;and *learn to accept this as a valid justification*, you will counteract the natural impulse of your mind to inhibit whatever behavior led to the loss.

The **overconfidence bias** and the **superiority bias** are also closely related to one another. The overconfidence bias refers to the bias of assuming an overly high degree of confidence and accuracy in one's own judgments. One study showed that when given tests of commonly misspelled words, when subjects wrote that they were 99% sure that a certain spelling was correct, they were wrong a whopping 40% of the time. This manifests in poker as the tendency to be overly confident in your own reads, your own assignments of probabilities, and the robustness of your strategies.

The superiority bias is the bias of overestimating one's skill at things one excels at, and exaggerating weakness at things one is bad at. As you can imagine, it's quite a widespread bias&mdash;the vast majority of people think of themselves as being &ldquo;above average&rdquo; at most things, while obviously only half of everyone can be above average. But notably, when it comes to skills at which people are poor, they tend to think they are *terrible*. In poker, this can manifest in different ways, depending on a player's conditioning history. Most mid to high stakes players tend to have a vastly overinflated sense of their own skill. This is because, if you take their personal conditioning history&mdash;objectively speaking, they have managed to become very good (within the top .001%) of players at this difficult game called poker. They have also managed to, with time and putting in hard work, overcome all of the players in the past whom they are now better than. In a way, it is not unreasonable for them to think that they have unlimited potential. But as a result, many of these players tend to think they are better than they really are, and think that out of the well of their creativity, they can pull something out that is going to beat a much stronger opponent. This results in an undue sense of superiority, an unchecked ego, and a warped sense of their relative skill level, which often gets these players into trouble. The other kind of player is one who has faced more hardships in their career&mdash;perhaps they play lower stakes after playing for many years (and maybe they played higher in the past, but can no longer hold their own at such stakes), or perhaps they are bumhunters. Because of these players' conditioning histories, they are much more likely to undervalue their own skill level. They will assume that most other regulars are better than them, and the ones who are, they will assume are *much* better than them. Both of these types of players have inaccurate perceptions of their own skill levels. Perceiving your own skill level is very difficult of course, but it is an essential part of the journey of being a poker player.

You can see in the aforementioned example how players who have done historically well tend to think that they are really great and capable, whereas players who have historically struggled tend to think that they are very limited. These are, of course, learned self-perceptions, and they are reinforced in large part by the **confirmation bias**. The confirmation bias is the tendency to search for and pay extra attention to information that confirms one's own prior beliefs. For example, the player who thinks he is really great will see every won match as evidence of the fact that he must be really great, and the player who thinks that he is mediocre will take every losing session as evidence that he needs to tone it down and bumhunt harder&mdash;but it may well be that both of these players are winning and losing the exact same percentage of their sessions. What matters much more is *how much cognitive weight* they are giving to each of these events. People are much more likely to give cognitive weight to information that affirms their own beliefs, presuppositions, and worldviews.

Confirmation bias crops up all over the place in poker talk and theory discussions, but I will explore that topic, along other errors of cognition such as **illusory correlations**, in more detail in the chapter on the poker community and poker language.

Finally, the last cognitive bias we will note here is the **hindsight bias**. The hindsight bias is the tendency to see past events are more predictable than they really were at the time they happened&mdash;the &ldquo;I knew it all along&rdquo; effect. The most salient examples of this tend to be in gameflow. If someone bets twice in a row in back to back big pots, it is often the case that if you end up calling the second time and he has the nuts, you think to yourself &ldquo;God, that was so obvious, nobody ever bluffs twice in a row like that&rdquo; but if you fold and he shows a bluff, you think to yourself &ldquo;Oh man, I knew it, that's such a good bluffing spot, my gut was telling me to call, too.&rdquo;

As a word of advice regarding this bias&mdash;go easy on yourself. Things and people are often not as predictable as you think they are. Ultimately this bias is very difficult to overcome, because poker is a game of hypothesis-generating and testing, and of course, it is hard to play poker without the (perhaps somewhat delusional) underlying belief that people and events are predictable if you look hard enough. Perhaps then, this is just one of those things that we must temper as best we can, but learn to accept as part of our cognitive inheritance. Perhaps we were simply not meant to be all that reasonable.

#### VI

The journey of a poker player centers on the process of improving, gradually getting better little by little, until one reaches a level of mastery. The ultimate goal, of course, is scaling the mountain of poker. But how does one reach that peak? How is mastery acquired?

Mastery is endlessly fascinating to us. From Wolfgang Mozart to Albert Einstein, Gary Kasparov to Michael Jordan, masters have always intrigued and captivated the human spirit. Given how much they inspire us, it should be no surprise that social scientists have intensely studied mastery over the last 100 years. Compared to the old vague and aristocratic notions of inborn genius, we now have a much better idea of how mastery is cultivated. Scholars have posited a four stage process for attaining mastery of any subject.

The **four stages of mastery** are as follows:

1. Unconscious incompetence
2. Conscious incompetence
3. Conscious competence
4. Unconscious competence

**Unconscious incompetence** is how one begins in any new activity. It is the *tabula rasa*&mdash;the blank slate. To be unconsciously incompetent means that one is bad, and does not know that one is bad, how one is bad, or why one is bad.

For example, imagine the first time you sat down at a poker game. You probably were playing hands like Q6 and A3 and 45o, minbetting or overshoving into tiny pots, not knowing whether any of those things were good or bad. This is unconscious incompetence.

In neuronal terms, unconscious incompetence is when your brain is dealing with a new external system, and has not yet built a complex internal network corresponding to each state of the external system. For example, the first time you come to your poker game, your brain has not built up mental associations with Q6o yet to know whether it's good or bad. It is only through the accrual of information and *feedback* that one passes beyond this stage, and the brain starts building up distinct and meaningful categories relating to each external state (such as each poker hand you can be dealt).

The next stage is **conscious incompetence**. Conscious incompetence is when one begins to be aware of one's own incompetence. It is, in a sense, to know just enough to know just how bad you are.

One example might be in speaking a foreign language. Imagine a foreign language which you can somewhat speak, but are far from fluent in. Chances are, you are consciously incompetent in this language. You know you are not getting the accent right, not pronouncing everything correctly, speaking too slowly, and perhaps your grammar or diction is slightly off. You are not oblivious to these things, which means you're past the stage of unconscious incompetence, but you are still nevertheless incapable of changing them. Your brain has not yet conditioned your vocal cords into the sweet spot of nailing that accent, your vocabulary is still disparate and disorganized within in your brain so it takes a long time to retrieve the right word, and so on. One passes through this stage just the same in speaking a language, in playing piano, sculpting marble, and playing poker.

The third stage is **conscious competence**. Conscious competence is the first stage of competence. In this stage, if you think about it, you'll know what to do. You are now making the right play in a poker match&mdash;you're no longer calling that flush on the river when the board double pairs; you no longer make plays that you &ldquo;knew you shouldn't make.&rdquo;

You are aware now of all of the elements that are going on in a poker match, the nuances of betsizing, betting patterns, timing tells, and so on. But these things are all processed consciously. You have to actively think about all of these things. When you are playing well, all of your mental processes are engaged. Neuronally speaking, your conscious centers (the neo-cortex) are actively engaged in retrieving and organizing the information you've accrued. In this stage, if you slip out of conscious focus&mdash;if you start zoning out, or auto-piloting, your play will deteriorate considerably from when you're fully conscious.

The final and ideal stage is **unconscious competence**. Unconscious competence is when you are unconsciously doing the right play, without really having to &ldquo;think&rdquo; about it.

The most obvious example of this is in driving a car (or if you can't drive, substitute riding a bike). Most people who have been driving a car have been doing it for many years, such that they are by now in a stage of unconscious competence. While driving, they never have to consciously think about changing gears, which pedal to push and how hard to push it, how to maneuver or effectively signal their lane changes, and so on. They can do things like carry on conversations, actively think about something, or pay attention to an audio lecture while still carrying on the activity effectively. This is a signature of unconscious competence.

In poker, the stage of unconscious competence is usually when you immediately know what you're going to do. You don't sit and think, try to think about board texture or how he'd perceive your bets, or anything like that&mdash;you simply immediately click your buttons, without giving it any thought. Almost always, this is a sign of an unconsciously competent behavior.

Moreover, there are two other major elements researchers have found when it comes to attaining mastery. They are, famously, 10,000 hours of *deliberate practice*, and an experienced mentor. We will look at both of these elements in closer depth in the chapter on learning.

#### VII

Now, you might say&mdash;okay, so there are these four stages of mastery. So what? How does that help me?

Well, there is a profound relationship between the stages of mastery and the process of learning poker, and understanding this relationship will help you to guide your own learning and improvement. First, let us try to understand the differences between conscious and unconscious thinking.

Let's begin with the obvious. In your conscious thinking, you are aware of everything that you are processing, and you experience all of it. In unconscious thinking, you are *not* aware of everything that you're processing, and you experience only a fraction of the data that your brain is working through. For example, you might have some vague awareness of yourself as &ldquo;playing poker,&rdquo; but if you're using your unconscious mind, you're not actively thinking about every bet size, every card on the board, and so on. Things become vastly condensed, the same way they do when you're driving a car and not needing to think about how to steer, or use your turn signals, etc.

Most importantly, conscious thinking tends to be discursive. It is process-oriented, and is often mediated through language. If you are consciously thinking out how to play a hand, there's a good chance that you're thinking in a step-by-step process: &ldquo;okay, he raised here, so that means he can only have X, Y, Z hands, but he bet this much on the turn so he can't have Z, and if he had Y then he'd probably have 3-bet preflop,&rdquo; and so on. Unconscious thinking, on the other hand, tends to be more instant. It is intuitive, and does not generally rely on such step-by-step processes to derive the answer; the unconscious mind directly connects the stimulus to its appropriate response. If you see a J98 flop, your unconscious mind immediately decides what to do; it has one response to that problem, which it applies without needing to derive it.

The implication of this is a very important one&mdash;because of this discursive, step-by-step process, conscious thinking is *slow*, and unconscious thinking is *fast*. I'll repeat this again, because it's vitally important: conscious thinking is *slower*, while unconscious thinking is *faster*. This may make some sense&mdash;your unconscious mind is what controls your most basic motor skills, internal organs, and so on. It needs to be fast, and needs to know exactly what it needs to do at any given moment, so once your unconscious mind is trained in any task, it operates with similar speed and certainty. Your conscious mind, on the other hand, can take some time. It can dally a bit, question itself, and be more process-oriented.

So to determine if a spot is being negotiated by your conscious mind, there are several key signs: if you are experiencing every element of its process, if it is being mediated through language (usually in your head), if it is taking place step-by-step, and if it is *slow*, then it is probably your conscious mind dealing with a spot. If, on the other hand, your experience feels very condensed, if you seem to automatically know the answer, and if it is *fast*, then it is probably your unconscious mind dealing with a spot.

One interesting experiment you can do to elucidate this is through self-talk (which we will discuss in more detail in the chapter on learning). If you make a conscious effort to say everything that you are thinking out loud and trace your thoughts verbally, most preferably to somebody else who's also proficient in poker&mdash;what you'll notice is that the majority of what you say will be related to the conscious spots you're facing. You are likely to pass over the unconscious parts of your poker thinking, such as interpreting (what to you are) obvious board textures and betting patterns, or making obvious plays. Those tend to be relegated to your unconscious mind and *aren't* rendered in language. Your conscious mind, because of its tendency toward being discursive and negotiated through language, will tend to bubble up, will be easily accessible to your verbal centers, and will wind up being most of what comes out of your mouth.

You will also notice this phenomenon in poker videos&mdash;oftentimes, when great players try to talk about poker and strategy, all that they will talk about is the processes of which *they* are conscious. As it happens, first rate poker players tend to have a *huge* part of their game relegated to unconscious competence, since they have played so many hours of poker, and are already situated in extremely effective unconscious habits. So perhaps you've noticed sometimes that really genius players, when they talk about their play, seem to say nothing that you actually want to know&mdash;this is the reason. It is easy and intuitive when engaging in self-talk (in this case, when narrating on a video) to say whatever is on the cusp of the conscious mind. But there is another skillset required to be a great teacher, video-maker, or coach of poker&mdash;one must also be able to probe one's own unconscious processes, to pay attention to not just one's own perception, but how a situation would be rendered through the eyes of a student's perception, and to try to see what a student would not understand. This is why the best poker players are oftentimes not the best teachers for low, medium, or even certain high level players.

So this analysis of the speed of conscious and unconscious processing gives us a new way to interpret timing in poker. Think about it&mdash;what does it mean when someone calls time to make a decision? Really what it means is that they are re-running their conscious discursive process on the same hand (sometimes repeatedly, when they are taking an extra-long amount of time)&mdash;they are repeatedly running their internal &ldquo;poker theory program&rdquo; to see what results it gets. This means that either their unconscious mind doesn't know what to do, or that they don't have confidence in their unconscious decisions for spots of a certain nature (such as big pots, or strange pots), and so they want to &ldquo;double check&rdquo; their unconscious reaction against their conscious, discursive processes.

It also gives us a new way of thinking about timing tells. Why is it that in certain spots, people act really quickly, but in others they slow down? This is exactly why. Because conscious thinking is slower than unconscious thinking, spots where people are forced to take time are spots where they are forced to recruit their conscious mind to figure out a spot. This also ties us back to the circle of centrality&mdash;the more central a spot is, the more it can be dealt with by the unconscious mind, which is fast and self-assured. The more non-central a spot is, the more it is dealt by the conscious mind&mdash;and once one leaves the circle of centrality, you can instantly notice a difference in your opponent's gameplay and thinking&mdash;this is the difference between his conscious and unconscious mind.

But how different exactly are the conscious and unconscious mind when it comes to the same activity? Is it really possible that your conscious mind would tell you to do one thing, and your unconscious mind tell you to do another?

In fact, as we have already learned, the two systems are *structurally separated*. Imagine them as two separate networks in your brain, separated in space and neuronal circuitry&mdash;though there is certainly interplay between them, they are architecturally distinct. In a very real sense, there are two poker players inside you&mdash;your conscious mind, and your unconscious mind, and they each would have different tendencies, frequencies, and habits if they were exclusively called upon to play poker.

#### VIII

There is an old debate as to whether or not poker should be considered a sport. Personally I think the whole question is tired and immaterial, but nevertheless, I do believe there is a certain insight that can be gained by classifying poker as a sport. If we say that poker is *not* a sport, then we run the risk of thinking of poker as a &ldquo;purely mental&rdquo; game. It vaguely implies that since you are not constrained by physical limitations in such a game, &ldquo;you can do whatever you want.&rdquo;

In reality, this is not the case at all. True, unlike a traditional sport, in poker you are not limited by your muscularity, your height, and so on. But you *are*constrained by the physical limitations *in your brain*. If your brain structures have not been properly attuned and calibrated by thousands and thousands of hours at the poker table, then you are, in a literal sense, physically incapable of making the right plays. Remember, making the right plays means to have the right neurons fire in the right order&mdash;which you cannot do unless you've already built a calibrated and complex neuronal network.

Neurologically speaking, there are two very different sorts of &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; encoded in our neuronal networks. The first is what we traditionally think of as knowledge: fact-based or **propositional knowledge**. The second type is **know-how** (also known as *non-declarative knowledge*). Propositional knowledge is knowledge of a proposition, like &ldquo;I should 3-bet KK preflop.&rdquo; Know-how, on the other hand, is your brain's knowledge of how to *internally execute* a behavior. Rather than a proposition stored inside your brain to be recalled, know-how contains all of the information about how to coordinate from your perceptual cues, how to send the right signals to motor neurons and muscle fibers, how to calibrate your movement and balance, and so on, in the process of performing an action. For example, how to properly throw a Frisbee is a matter of know-how. You don't need to know anything propositional about how to throw a Frisbee&mdash;you don't need to know that you should hold it with one grip or another, or some rule of thumb about how to adjust according to wind speed and direction&mdash;your body learns this automatically, without your conscious mind ever formulating it into propositional knowledge.

The crucial insight is that actually playing poker largely *is a matter of know-how*, not of merely of propositional knowledge. When you learn poker and become good at it, your brain is building internal structures of know-how that are unconsciously coordinating your perception with your motor reactions. This is not obvious, because we don't think of poker as a physical game, but the way you *learn* poker is nevertheless the same as with any sport.

If you are a football player, it is certainly helpful to learn football theory, but the only way you get good is by developing your know-how, your body's internal awareness of the game, your muscle memory and calibration, by playing a lot football and being out on the field. Though the systems can affect one another, football theory and football play are not the same. This is the same within poker. In other words, *the system in your brain that contains poker theory is structurally separate from the system that governs your play*.

Let us draw then the distinction between **poker theory** and **poker know-how** (or &ldquo;poker play&rdquo;).

Poker theory is a conscious network that you have in your mind. You train and deepen this network by talking about poker, by studying poker videos, by going over other people's hands, by reading poker books, by doing poker math simulations, and so on.

Imagine it as a computer program that you've built in your mental circuitry. This program started off quite shoddy (since we all start with a weak grasp of poker theory), but it's gotten more and more complex the more you've learned about poker. If you input all of the variables of a hand into your poker theory program, it takes it all in, crunches it, and then spits out an answer as to what you should do. This program is slow, as we discussed before, since it is discursive and has to run through many lines of code, and so it's unlikely that you'll use this program for every hand you play&mdash;but in the really tough hands, you almost always consult it. So what you are really doing when you call time in a hand is to run this program, sometimes more than once, to try to ascertain whether you're making the right play according to your version of poker theory.

We can say then that your poker theory system is trained by taking poker hands and deriving their solutions. We practice this over and over again&mdash;through videos, forum hands, looking at hand histories we and our friends have played, arguing over poker theory&mdash;and gradually building up the accuracy of this internal program, and its correlation with *true* poker theory (which presumably exists somewhere out there in poker, and is embedded in the feedback we get).

On the other hand, when we actually *play* poker, we are engaged in something different. We are not calling upon the propositional knowledge or discursive processes that are contained in the poker theory part of our brain. What we are executing is our poker know-how&mdash;our unconscious mind's &ldquo;muscle memory&rdquo; system that gives us immediate reactions, gut feelings, intuitions about what the right play is, about what a bet size means, about whether this hand is strong enough to call in this spot. It's what tells us what to do, and instantly moves our fingers toward clicking a button, or folding on a turn card, or going all-in.

Our poker know-how is what actually constitutes our poker perception. That is, the way we see a Js9s8s flop or the hand AJo is *created* by our poker know-how. In a very real sense, you perceive a hand like AJo pre-rationally&mdash;mathematics, hand charts, and your conscious mind never come into it. You have a &ldquo;sense&rdquo; of how strong this hand is, of how it works, of how it should be played, and so on. Of course, you can try to *reconstitute* this perception, by running through your internal poker theory program, perhaps trying to figure out how AJo does against a certain range that you put him on using his preflop stats&mdash;but the vast majority of time, you simply function with whatever perception your poker know-how seeds you.

Poker know-how is trained primarily by playing. As with any other physical activity, like swimming or riding a bike, you cannot learn poker know-how by reading a book or by watching somebody else do it. Poker know-how and unconscious reactions are learned chiefly by direct experiential feedback. Your unconscious mind responds and calibrates itself according to reward and punishment. Now, this reward and punishment can be administered in many ways&mdash;it can come from making a failed or successful play, obviously; but it can also come from criticizing yourself on a play that you think was bad, from getting criticized from someone else who is looking over a hand you played, from watching a video in which the chosen play differs from what you'd do, and so on. But with each of these three latter examples, *the further you get away from the actual experience of poker play, the more you are engaging your conscious mind, and the less you are developing your know-how*.

In other words, the further a source of feedback is from the native context in which you are going to use it, the less effectively that feedback is going to influence your behavior in that context. We will discuss these ideas in more detail and many more in the chapter on learning, so we will leave it at that for now.

To sum up, we can see how there are two very distinct poker systems that exist within our mind&mdash;the conscious system, which contains all of our poker theory, and which is related to our propositional knowledge of poker; and the unconscious system, which contains our poker know-how, and is what we are doing most of the time we actually play poker. They are two distinct systems, separated in our brains, and most significantly, they are learned and cultivated differently.

The next time you play, pay attention to these differences. See if you can spot what sort of situations your conscious mind is consistently being engaged, and which parts of your game are being relegated to your unconscious mind. You might be surprised.

#### IX

Distance yourself, then, from your conscious mind. Step off from the throne, and inspect the entire system with objectivity. Look here. This is who you are. This is how you think. Not just the surface, but beneath it as well.

You must become your own psychonaut, exploring the landscape of your inner psyche. After all, your brain was not designed to play poker. Your brain resists poker. Probabilities, uncertainties, cognitive biases, illusory correlations, and the ever-present hailstorm of stress and downswings thwart your desire to wrap your mind around this complex, beautiful, infuriating game. To make poker fit into your brain is to shove a square peg in a round hole.

But you are okay with that. You accept it. You will do what it takes.

Poker is, in the end, the battle against human irrationality. To master poker is to master the brain&mdash;to master the human apparatus. This is also the journey.

And perhaps if it weren't so hard, if it were easy for you to learn poker, then poker wouldn't be such a dynamic, lucrative, and vibrant world. Perhaps you should be grateful that it is the way it is.

So you must face the challenge. Survey yourself, and let your eyes tell you the truth, like the eyes of a beginner, as though seeing yourself for the first time.

Tell the whole, the ugly truth. What do you want? What are you good at, what are you bad at? What are your failings, your successes? What are you lying to yourself about? Nobody will answer these questions for you. You are alone. You are free to lie to yourself of course; no one will stop you. There are no shortcuts; there are no secrets.

Do you know what you tend to assume about others? What you're afraid of? What you want most? What is it like to play against you? If you can't find these things, ask those close to you. And if they don't know, ask your enemies. Somewhere in the middle of all their perceptions and your own, is the reality of who you are&mdash;and it is that reality you are tasked with understanding.

The question demands itself. Who are you? Poker will ask you this many times over your career. But it is up to you whether you are willing to truly answer it.

 You may have noticed a continuing theme throughout this exploration of cognition: it would appear we are not quite in as much control over ourselves as we'd like to believe.

This is something of an uneasy conclusion, especially for an aspiring poker player invested in his own growth. Understandably so! It *should* make you a little uncomfortable. But nevertheless, you must pull back the camera, and learn to look upon your brain from an outside perspective.

Currently, most prominent theorists of cognition use the metaphor of seeing the brain as a computer, and you've noticed this metaphor crop up a few times in our discussion. It's a good analogue of how our brains work, so let's extend it to its logical completion. We've agreed that our conscious poker theory seems to work like a complex computer program, but we can say that our unconscious poker know-how is like a sort of program as well&mdash;just one that is more simple, acts much faster (perhaps more like a database-lookup than as a discursive problem-solving process), and so on. But as we are sitting at a table, playing with limited conscious awareness, this know-how program is buzzing away in our brains, ordering our fingers where to click, interpreting our perceptions, and responding to feedback.

But as with any program, our internal programs are constrained by their code. If there are errors in your internal code which cause you to make mistakes, then in a sense, you cannot &ldquo;change&rdquo; those mistakes. They will keep happening, over and over again, until you fix your internal code. You are constrained by the way your mental programs are written.

Now, you might point out that this sort of thinking doesn't allow room for being able to play better or worse at any given time, which we clearly do. How can one account for that? Perhaps you will accuse this perspective of being overly reductive.

But I challenge you&mdash;when you sit down at a table to play poker, what are you really in control of? It's important to realize that at any given moment you're playing, the set of all strategies that you'd use in a response to any situation is already embedded in your neuronal network&mdash;that is, the code of your internal programs is already written. In the moment of playing, *you have no conscious control over that.* That is, you can't suddenly &ldquo;decide&rdquo; to use a strategy that you don't know is a good strategy, or &ldquo;decide&rdquo; not to make a mistake in a spot where you're mentally predisposed to making a mistake.

Over time, sure, you can change these predispositions, alter your neuronal networks, rewrite your mental code&mdash;but it is a gradual, piece-by-piece process, as you slowly break bad habits and form good ones.

In any moment, the factors over which you exert genuine conscious influence are surprisingly small. And what are they?

First, you have control over your initial game selection standards&mdash;that is, what standard of how bad of players or tables you're willing to sit down with. Note the word &ldquo;initial&rdquo;&mdash;if you reach a state of tilt, chances are, your game selection will go out the window. Tilt is guided mostly by the limbic brain system, thus it will forcefully background your conscious processes. So all you really have conscious control over is how bad of tables you're willing to *initially*sit in on. But if you're a bad tilter, then you have no control over that 5% of the time when you go on bad tilt&mdash;it's simply a 5% that may or may not arise depending on how bad you are running, and other factors.

The second thing you have control over is when and in what state of mind you start to play. Perhaps you will elect to play mornings, nights, on days when you haven't had sleep, before you've eaten breakfast, when something stressful has just happened to you, and so on. You can see clearly that each of these variables is likely to affect how well you play, and these are all fully within your conscious control.

And third, you have control over what rituals you choose to implement before or during playing. This is vitally important. Rituals would include things like reviewing hands before a session, watching a poker video, reading something inspirational or instructional, doing exercise, reciting a mantra, stretching or doing a breathing exercise, and so on. It also includes things that can take place *during*a session, such as forcing yourself to take breaks at certain times, or quitting at a certain time or when down a number of buyins, forcing out distractions, and so on. Implementing rituals are a means of co-opting your environment to enact your conscious goals, as discussed in section IV. Even if the ritual takes place in the middle of a session and catches you at a point when you're not consciously alert, it will nevertheless force you back into alignment with your conscious intentions. The rituals I've mentioned are examples of some the major ways in which, even if your unconscious mind is poorly trained, you can exert influence over how well you play in a session through the conscious mind.

So there *are* several things we have meaningful conscious control over. But beyond those few things you can control, in a profound sense, almost everything that happens in a poker game is *out of your control*. Who sits at your table, how bad they are, how long the fish stays, how many KK vs AAs or AA vs KKs you get, how many times you soulread the fish, how many times you bluff off a stack to your table nemesis&mdash;these things are only in your control as much as these three factors are in your control. Everything else is simply permutations that were already there; they are simply one of the many possibilities that could happen given your brain structures at the time you go into a session.

So, where does that leave us? What does it mean to play well, and how can we go about doing that? How do we navigate the internal experience of actually trying to play poker?

I will explore those ideas in more detail in the following chapters. Though we have explored much in the realm of poker, there is much yet to go. Next, we will explore creativity, fear, and the role of emotion in poker.

Greetings citizens of the world,

It's become something of a routine that whenever I post a new blog post, I apologize for not rolling them out often enough. This time, I'll save you the jig.

You'll notice I have a new site! Basically, the formatting on Blogspot really sucks and the interface is pretty clunky, so I decided to migrate my blog over to WordPress instead. Right now it's a little rough, and I'll clean it up later, but I've been told that having a central site will come in down later on down the road if I want to publish a book. So, if you have any advice regarding the site, do let me know. I'll be adding stuff as time goes on, but update your bookmarks if you haven't already. :)

This next chapter took me a long time before I got it to be satisfactory, but it has been informed by a lot of my experiences in mental coaching. If you have any tilt issues, or are simply interested in the questions of how emotions, such as fear, anger, and excitement relate to poker, I think you'll find this chapter really fascinating. It's the longest chapter yet, but there's a lot of good stuff in here.

Again, if you are interested in mental coaching, or want to contact me for whatever reason, I'm reachable at [haseebcoach@gmail.com](mailto:haseebcoach@gmail.com). I've been getting some questions about mental coaching (that is, asking what exactly it is), so I may make a short post later explaining the in's and out's. But, enough from me. Here's… well, me. But better me.

Enjoy.

#### I

Let us return to our original question: what is the relationship between emotion and rationality? We saw in the last chapter that even when we *attempt* to be rational, our cognitive apparatus often fails us, because aspects of it are inherently irrational. The nemesis of rationality is irrationality, not emotion. So what role does emotion play?

We can understand the role of emotion by examining the limits of rationality in more detail. What precisely does it mean to be rational? Consider this within a wider context than poker.

Ideally, we can say that rationality is a kind of optimization. It is acting in order to maximize desirable results. Note the goal in this definition&mdash;&ldquo;desirable results.&rdquo; How do we rationally determine which results are desirable and which are not? A result being &ldquo;desirable&rdquo; implies that it's a result we want. But why should we want it?

The famous dictum goes &ldquo;no *is* implies an *ought*.&rdquo; In other words, facts can ever lead to an imperative. You cannot use rationality to determine your path until you know what you want. The only way that we can say someone *ought* to do something is by having preexistent, axiomatic values; and values can never be derived *a priori*, by facts, or by &ldquo;rationality.&rdquo; Rationality is an optimization algorithm&mdash;but it must have as an input the *value* you want to optimize for.

This means that rationality and emotion are intertwined. If you have no emotions&mdash;that is, if there's nothing that you inherently value more than something else, then there is nothing to optimize for. Emotion is the seed for rationality. Imagine, for a moment, an extremely intelligent AI that exists purely within a computer, but is not programmed to value anything in particular. Would it try to cure cancer? Compose art? Master a game of cards? If one does not possess values, rationality is like a hammer in a house with no nails.

So what is it that we value? In moral reasoning, the value optimized for is moral equity. In cooking, the value optimized for is taste. And in poker, the value optimized for is money. Or is it?

There is a long-standing idea in poker that poker players are supposed to be &ldquo;emotionless,&rdquo; and care only about money. Though it's not immediately obvious, there are more things than money that are of value in poker. We brushed against this idea earlier when we discussed tilt and the notion of giving tilters what they want. The reality is that poker player cares about many more things than money. Poker players are enticed into making monetarily suboptimal decisions all the time! Consider just a few of the values that they sometimes pursue instead: lowering variance; reducing anxiety by playing lower or game selecting tighter; having fun or avoiding boredom; experiencing excitement; bolstering their egos; feeling better than their opponents; feeling like they are is improving or learning; feeling a sense of community; feeling cool; teaching others; getting even; venting anger; sleeping well; having a balanced lifestyle (electing not to play in certain +EV games). The list goes on.

As poker players, we make these sorts of tradeoffs routinely. Though we probably don't think of them in such terms, in their rawest form, that's what they are. You should not dismiss these as betrayals against rationality. In fact, it's better to think of these behaviors as *indicators of your values*.

In other words, if you choose to quit a profitable match because it's boring, or choose to play a more aggressive style because it's more fun and interesting, or even if you choose to play for 8 hours straight to try to get even, you should not think of those choices as working against your ultimate value of making as much money as possible. What these choices indicate is that *you have other values in play* that you are working toward, and that you are paying for in $EV. Now, you may not be fulfilling those values rationally (i.e., in a fully optimal way), but that's a separate matter.

You might object, &ldquo;but when I'm playing a marathon session to get even, I don't actually *value* getting even, I just want to get even in that moment. It's different.&rdquo; This is true, and gets at an important insight, which is that not all values are equal. We clearly value money in a different way than we value something like getting even. This distinction is known as **orders of desire**. The things that you want at any moment are **first-order desires**. But the things that you *want* to want, or the values that you *wish* you upheld are your **second-order desires**. For example, if you're trying to quit smoking, then your first-order desire might be to smoke a cigarette and to alleviate your cravings, but your second-order desire (what you want to want) might be *to not want* to smoke that cigarette, and thus you try to push through your withdrawal symptoms, so that you can eventually not want to smoke cigarettes anymore.

You might then argue that getting even during a session is a first-order desire, but maximizing money in the long run is a second-order desire. Generally, at any given time, there may be a discrepancy between our first-order desires and our second-order desires. Thus, one of our major second order desires is *to align our first-order desires with our second-order desires*. And this is the impulse that leads us to scorn ourselves when, in a moment of &ldquo;passion,&rdquo; we tilt, play above our rolls, or such.

This is a valid insight. It goes without saying that you should try to adapt your current self to your ideal self. But problems arise because many poker players mistakenly believe that money is their sole second-order desire. They believe that money is the only thing that they *should* want. But since money is not an end in itself, this is ludicrous. Money is only valuable insofar as it leads to happiness. Instead, happiness should be the second-order desire, with money only as a sub-goal insofar as it can secure happiness. But happiness is also optimized by other means!&mdash;such as choosing to play fun matches, not playing marathon sessions, getting good sleep and taking care of one's body, minimizing variance and stress, or even challenging oneself with difficult opponents. We choose happiness over monetary optimization in many ways. And we are right to do so!

This is what I am driving at. There are certainly some emotions that we should wish to avoid, but neglecting one's entire emotional life is a profound mistake. Poker takes place within the context of your life&mdash;your life! You shouldn't *want* to be an emotionless robot&mdash;not only because it's impossible, but because it won't make you happy.

To completely eschew emotion is, in a fundamental sense, to misunderstand what you're working toward.

#### II

Even if this reasoning seems sound to you, the intuition might persist that there's a deep opposition between emotion and rationality. You might think, &ldquo;Sure, I can see your argument, but the next time I sit down for a game of poker, I'm still going to see emotion as the enemy. That's just how it is.&rdquo; Let us then look at a second problem with the supposed rift between emotion and rationality.

When we think of emotion as the enemy in poker, really what we mean by &ldquo;emotion&rdquo; is something like &ldquo;emotions that negatively affect good judgment.&rdquo; It's obvious that emotion can sometimes interfere with and override rationality. But emotion plays many complex and multifaceted roles in human life, which are not always at odds with or detrimental to rationality. Our emotions are not limited to things like anger, frustration, envy, and the like. Confidence, self-criticism, preference, and elation are all also parts of our emotional substructure, and clearly those things are not detrimental.

Psychology and neuroscience have taught us that emotions are essential even in cognition and decision-making. Consider an experiment known as the *Iowa gambling task*. In the experimental setup, a subject is presented with four decks, and they either win money or lose money, depending on which card they draw off the top of a deck. It's a game of pure chance. The catch is that the experiment is set up so that one of the decks is rigged so that it loses more often than the others. The subjects are not told this.

The experiment reveals that before any of the subjects are consciously aware of one of the decks being rigged, or are able to articulate any suspicions, they emotionally respond to the rigged deck. Their hands may shake, or they may have an elevated galvanic skin response when they hover over the bad deck, and they will choose the other ones. This is all pre-conscious, pre-rational. However, if you take subjects with damage to their orbitofrontal cortex, a central part of the limbic (emotional) system, experiments have shown that these subjects will persist in choosing rigged decks, regardless of their results. Until their conscious minds pick up on the fact that the deck is rigged, and sometimes even after their conscious minds do, they have trouble differentiating the deck from the others.

What does this mean? It means that *emotion is integral to learning*. Essentially, the Iowa gambling task hinges on reward and punishment&mdash;bad decks punish you, and good decks reward you. But reward and punishment are not only absorbed by your conscious mind, they are also processed via emotions. This makes sense intuitively&mdash;in most forms of punishment, it's the emotional recoil, not the conscious consideration, which is more powerful. Of course, poker is no exception. If you choose a bad strategy, or consistently make a bad play, one of the chief ways in which you will learn and adjust this behavior is getting punished by losing pots. And your unconscious mind, your emotional system, is *constantly* being adjusted by this reward and punishment.

Again, imagine a truly emotionless person, a sort of internal zombie. Why would they prefer winning over losing? There would be no reason to. Emotion is a vital part of how we make meaningful decisions, in both simple and complex problems. In our day-to-day lives, when we talk about emotion, we tend to mean only certain ones (and in poker, particularly the negative ones). But the role of emotion in our cognitive life is *much* more various and complex than that, and we must take it as it is, without simplification.

This is why the idea of being an &ldquo;emotionless robot&rdquo; in poker is fundamentally absurd. To not have any emotions would actually impair our ability to learn, to respond to the world, and most importantly, to secure our own well-being. The notion hinges on a misunderstanding of what emotion actually is.

You might interject, &ldquo;well, what about an abstract poker playing computer program that doesn't have human emotions, never tilts, and so on? Wouldn't that be superior to an emotional human?&rdquo;

I concede, this is correct. An AI that was of equivalent skill to a human being, but without emotional responses, would be a superior poker player. However&mdash;*we are not faced with that choice*. Remember, the game that we're playing is not some abstract version of poker. The game we are playing is *humans playing poker*. And in this game, emotion is an indispensable part of our mental apparatus. Emotion simply *is* part of how we think and learn. We must try to master ourselves, but we must do so *within* the confines of our mental machinery.

So, yes, let us be as rational as we can. And indeed, let us try to dampen the emotional responses that are to our detriment. But to be a good human poker player, you *must* also be emotional. You *must* recoil from losses; you *must* hurt when someone outsmarts you; you *must* have a selfish ego that hungers to improve; and you *must* feel good when you succeed! Without these things, poker would be an empty ritual, a dispassionate procedure, and it would be impossible to muster the energy and desire that it takes to climb up the mountain. You must suffer, you must fantasize, you must be drunk with imagination. The path to mastery requires no less of you.

#### III

Understand, then, that emotional responses, such as tilting, are not merely random blips. They do not arise without a reason. After all, not every player tilts in the same way, or has a similar threshold for tilting, or is tilted by the same things. But if we take emotional responses as indications of our underlying values, then we gain insight into how we can reduce tilt and other unwanted behaviors.

Consider emotional responses as ticker tape from the unconscious mind. If you have a persistent issue of quitting games too early when you're winning, or if you're liable to tilt when you lose to a player who you think is bad, or if you tend to start splashing around when you're bored, these are all indicators of underlying values&mdash;that is, your first order desires. If you quit games too early, it's likely that you value the feeling/knowledge of having a winning session; if you tilt against bad players, it's likely that you value the feeling of superiority over others and feel strong entitlement to winning; and if you splash around when bored, it's likely that you value excitement and having fun.

Notice I refrain from claiming you &ldquo;over-value&rdquo; these things. It's impossible for anyone to objectively claim that you anyone over-values anything, because values cannot be &ldquo;decided&rdquo; rationally. A person merely has values and chooses to uphold them. If you value excitement, and are perfectly happy with that value, who am I to say that you should choose money over excitement? However, if *your second-order desire* is that you want to prefer to make money over playing exciting matches&mdash;that is, you want to *change* your first-order desires&mdash;then at that point, we can try to rectify this mismatch.

Harnessing your emotional capacities, positive and negative, begins with an honest evaluation. You cannot blindly rebel against the emotional reaction, as though the emotion itself is the problem. If you splash around in boring matches, that is only a *symptom* of an underlying desire. To blame your splashing around would be like blaming a cough, while ignoring the underlying virus. If you value excitement, then first you must admit to yourself that you value it. If you didn't, then you would simply not splash around to begin with.

Once you acknowledge that you do indeed value some emotion, you can work toward rerouting it through a different outlet, or extinguishing the emotion altogether.

#### IV

Tilt.

The word can hardly be pronounced without conjuring memories&mdash;dented walls, marathon sessions, broken keyboards, and that empty, flattened feeling you get after having donked away half of your bankroll, staring at the ceiling at 5AM, waiting hopelessly for sleep to arrive. Everyone has a story about it, everyone has a scar. It is our common demon. Any poker room will bubble up with advice on how to deal with it. Tilt is one of the most fruitful, and tired, topics in poker.

Let's talk about tilt.

We tackled the subject briefly when we discussed opponent psychology, but now we will take the internal perspective. We will explore how tilt manifests, how to conceptualize it, the various forms it takes, and how to abate it.

We'll begin with some definitions. **Tilt** is, simply, when your emotions negatively affect your normal gameplay. Tilt is primarily caused by five things: losing a pot, failing a play, feeling insulted or disrespected, having an atrophied mental state (such as by being tired, hungry, or hung over), or being affected by concurrent life events (such as losing a job, having a fight with your significant other, etc.).

I also stated before that there are two major manifestations of tilt&mdash;hot tilt and cold tilt. **Hot tilt** is the aggressive, angry, try-to-win-it-all-back-right-now type of tilt, which can be emblemized by the blind all-in preflop shove. **Cold tilt** is more of the resigned, tired, just-let-me-get-aces-one-time type of tilt, which is emblemized by the player who's been playing for twelve hours straight and is folding to all of your 3-bets. For more discussion on hot tilt vs. cold tilt, see Chapter 3. 

We discussed before the &ldquo;pot of boiling water&rdquo; metaphor for tilt. Your tilt level is like a pot filled with warm water. As bad (tilting) things happen to you, they each deliver a unit of heat to the pot of water. For a while, the heat won't affect you, and your internal water will remain stable and calm. But after a certain point&mdash;at your boiling point (i.e., your tilt threshold), the water will start to simmer, and as more heat is added, boil more and more violently. This is the nature of tilt.

But like with a pot of water, once you turn off the heat (i.e., step away from the poker game), this does not mean that your tiltedness diminishes to zero. The pot of water will retain some of the heat, which we call **accumulated tilt**. It is essentially the residual tilt from a downswing, or lots of bad beats, or whatever. Thus, the next time the heat is turned on, it is easier to bring one's pot to a boil. Accumulated tilt can be naturally resolved by simply letting the pot cool down for a while (i.e., taking a break), but there are also other methods for attacking accumulated tilt, which will be discussed in the subsequent section on downswings.

This serves as an adequate definition of tilt. But this leaves the question&mdash;what is going on beneath the surface? Why does tilt happen at all? How does it work?

Let's start at the level of the brain. If tilt is when our emotions negatively affect our normal gameplay, then we can restate this as our limbic system (part of the unconscious mind, which regulates emotional responses) inhibiting our conscious mind (which is supposed to be regulating our unconscious poker game with theory). When a player goes on monkey tilt, he undergoes a flight or fight response&mdash;due to various neurochemical reactions, his unconscious mind, with its impulses, instincts, and reactivity, takes control over his poker decisions. The conscious mind is essentially overridden (and partially shut down to conserve energy).

Recall the distinction we made before between conscious competence and unconscious competence. Essentially what happens when one is tilting is that the conscious mind is getting pushed out of the picture, and therefore the unconscious mind is in full control. The result is that when you tilt, you are performing your unconscious competency, without the self-checking conscious mind looking over your shoulder. In other words, *what you do when you tilt is equivalent to your unconsciously mastered game.*

Have you ever wondered why people behave differently when they tilt?

Let's take two players of equivalent skill level, who play the same stakes, but tilt very differently. And let's say that they both go on monkey tilt (and their level of tiltedness is equivalent). The first player might start 3-betting more aggressively and 4-bet calling off with medium pairs, making more desperate hero calls, all of which he normally doesn't do. But the second player, despite being of the same skill level&mdash;when he goes on tilt, he open shoves ace-rag preflop into four players, and then checkraises a flop with a gutshot, fires turn, and overbet-shoves-river when he misses. He seems much crazier when he tilts.

Clearly, these two players tilt very differently. A naïve interpretation might be that &ldquo;oh, player 2 is just a monkey.&rdquo; But let's be more precise. If we take tilt as an indicator of your unconscious game, what this implies is that when player 1 takes off all of his conscious mental checks, all that he has unconsciously trained himself to be *able* to do is to elevate his 3-betting frequency, 4-bet/call more, etc. Player 1, in a profound sense, *cannot* open shove A4o preflop like player 2 can. His unconscious mind won't let him. He doesn't even perceive it as a possibility, or a decision to ever make. In other words, player 2 is not &ldquo;more tilted&rdquo; than player 1 in order to make &ldquo;tiltier&rdquo; plays&mdash;it is simply an indication that player 2's unconscious mind is less restricting of the available poker space. Player 2's unconscious mind sees open shoving A4o preflop as a possible play, where Player 1's mind does not.

In a sense, when you tilt, your mental shackles start going off, one by one. Your most unrestricted conception of what is possible in poker begins to come out. But most people, myself included, have too much mental inhibition to ever open shove a hand, no matter how tilted they are. I have monkey tilted many times in my career, but I have never considered open shoving a hand preflop&mdash;I have never even been close. This is not because I have not &ldquo;tilted as bad&rdquo; as someone else, but simply that my completely unfettered unconscious mind could not even consider doing such a thing&mdash;but it nevertheless did all that it was capable of doing. With tilt, some play looser, some 3-bet more, and some make hero shoves. But, at its essence, your unconscious mind will only do things that it believes might work. Chances are, if somebody is open shoving preflop, he unconsciously believes that he might end up winning (and it is likely that if this behavior has not been extinguished, it has been rewarded at some point in the past, which is why his unconscious mind continues to do it)&mdash;or, alternatively, if someone is open shoving hands preflop, it is possible that what he actually wants to do is lose (we will discuss the desire to lose and reset your narrative in the subsequent section).

Recall the perspective we've been discussing earlier with regards to emotion. Emotional responses always arise for a reason; they are vestiges of the emotional substructure beneath them. To dismiss them as merely random blips is to simply throw away information. There is no such thing as &ldquo;just tilt.&rdquo; There is always some underlying value, desire, or belief to which tilt is merely the response. If you want to correct your tilt, you must first understand the underlying emotional structure and incentives.

Here, then, we can see one of the problems for the term &ldquo;tilt&rdquo; as it's commonly used. We have defined tilt as &ldquo;emotions negatively affecting our gameplay&rdquo;&mdash;but if you think about it, this definition is enormous. We already know that &ldquo;emotion&rdquo; runs a large gamut. To compress all of the ways that emotion can affect us into one word, &ldquo;tilt,&rdquo; is problematic&mdash;two players can both say that they have tilt problems, and yet have almost nothing in common in terms of their particular issues, triggers, or solutions. One player may tilt because he feels like he never gets to win a flip, and the other may tilt because he's tired, and has been playing too long, and his mother-in-law has been yelling at him. So if you tell me &ldquo;I lost money because of tilt today,&rdquo; the inexactness of that word fails to capture nuanced information about *why* and *in what way* you tilted.

Poker players are great at discussing strategic mistakes that made them lose&mdash;&ldquo;I was 3-betting too much and trying to win too many pots,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I kept calling all his river shoves when he was playing pretty nitty,&rdquo; but never will you hear a poker player tell someone else &ldquo;I was tilting because I felt like I deserved to win, so I decided to try to force winning and increase variance by moving up.&rdquo;

Perhaps this is an understandable development&mdash;our hyper-masculine poker culture is discouraging of emotion and vulnerability. This has the effect of stifling emotional self-awareness. Interestingly, poker strategy has evolved tremendously in the last five years, as a result of open, rigorous discourse and exchange of ideas&mdash;but emotional skills have not really followed alongside it. This is due in no small part to the implicit taboo of talking openly and vulnerably about one's own tilt. Though we might be fine admitting to strategic mistakes, we are more likely to laugh off our tilt mistakes&mdash;among friends, to joke about our degeneracy, only to sulk over our failings in private.

Emotional skills are developed no differently than strategic skills. And in order to develop them, it takes time, discipline, and most importantly, the acuity to see oneself and one's mistakes honestly.

So we've established that there are many different kinds of tilt, and that it is problematic to group them all under one umbrella. Jared Tendler, in *The Mental Game of Poker* lists what he thinks are the six main types of tilt: injustice tilt, hate-losing tilt, mistake tilt, entitlement tilt, revenge tilt, and desperation tilt. These are convenient categories, but ultimately, tilt spans a spectrum, and there can be no generalized solution to tilt that will apply to everyone, since everyone has their own specific emotional profile, beliefs, and values.

Thus, there is no generalized answer to the question&mdash;&ldquo;why do people tilt at all?&rdquo; If we take the perspective that our behaviors arise for good reasons, then what problem in our emotional substructure does tilt solve? You could talk about the conditioning of correct behaviors with their rewards, you could talk about trying to secure positive self-perceptions and egotistical homeostasis, you could talk about rebelling against the structure of injustice in poker, you could talk about trying to attack your opponents to restore your sense of superiority&mdash;there are many reasons why people tilt, but we each tilt for our reasons, and in our own ways. There is no single answer that pertains to everyone, and so we must each seek to understand how we ourselves are emotionally constituted.

So let's say you're already in a session, and you realize that you've begun tilting&mdash;what can you do to allay your tilt? Well, as long as I have you here: quit. But, of course, you're tilting, so perhaps that's a futile suggestion. The first of the effective techniques for alleviating tilt is **breath control**. There are literally hundreds of different breath control techniques&mdash;which one in particular you choose is unimportant. If you are not familiar with any, I would recommend simply this&mdash;when you realize you are on tilt, lean back in your chair to open up your diaphragm and support your lower back. Relax your body as much as you can. Then, close your eyes, and take ten deep, long breaths. As you are taking these breaths, try to internally scan your body. Try to think, &ldquo;Hmm… let's look at what sensations I'm feeling. Let's see what this tilt feels like. Where do I feel it? What does it feel like in my body?&rdquo; As you are taking these long breaths, try to look objectively at what sensations you're experiencing internally. The very act of calm examination will defang many of the emotions and sensations. If this moment of mental distance allows you to convince yourself to quit, or even if you sit back in and continue to play, you will feel better, more centered, calm, and self-aware if you engage in this exercise.

There are a number of other things that can help with tilt problems&mdash;there are mantras you can recite to yourself, pre-session rituals, taking breaks, visualizing, and so on. The list is endless, and like I said, there is no special ritual that is going to work for everyone.

But ultimately, for most people, tilt is a very difficult issue to correct on one's own. It's not impossible, by any means, and most players will naturally improve at it over time&mdash;but having seen many, many players who wanted to improve on their own, I have noticed that tilt tends to be the most recalcitrant part of people's games. When someone is a complete tiltmonkey, it is usually obvious, even for them. And those people, if they hit their bottom or get the wind knocked out of them enough times, will often seek help. They know that they are tiltmonkeys. But for most people, tilt is like a sleeping bear that lives in their mental cave&mdash;they never know when it will wake up and bite them again. But because it is usually asleep, most of the time they feel like tilt is not really a significant problem. In a way, most players would be lucky if instead of only tilting in small, intermittent episodes, they tilted continuously, only a little bit, all the time&mdash;they would be forced to be more aware of their emotional weaknesses.

Ultimately, if your tilt problems are very serious, and are causing major negative effects on the rest of your life, then I recommend consulting a psychologist or licensed therapist. Although a poker mental coach can help you to understand your motivations, your tilt profile, and help you to work through tilt and develop better habits&mdash;it is a short stumble from a tilt problem to a gambling problem. When in doubt, you should consult a licensed professional.

Downswings are inevitable in poker. As successful as you think the greatest players are, part of what makes them great is that they have braved downswings harder and deeper than anyone else. It is a statistical reality that the longer you play poker, the more likely it is you will face a downswing of such titanic proportions.

We are naturally inclined to think of ourselves as poker players in terms of how we are when things are going well, and we are successful. But how you face those downswings is just as big, if not a bigger part, of your true capability as a poker player. *How you face your downswings is a vital part of your skill*.

I emphasize this, because it's such a direly important point. Being a great poker player isn't just about grinding past the downswings and focusing on the upswings and the nice graphs and taking shots and moving up. A huge part of the journey of a poker player is *how you brave* your downswings. It is gritting your teeth, and taking punishment, again and again, day after day, and holding fast. Being a good player when you're winning is not enough.

It is always possible that a storm of variance will hit you&mdash;a storm so large, so powerful, and so destructive that you will not survive it&mdash;so destructive that it will break you. And someday, if you keep playing poker, you will face a downswing bigger, deeper, and longer than you ever thought possible. This is a statistical reality. No amount of playing good, or praying, or good karma will protect you from it. It is only a matter of chance. The question, then, is what is your threshold? How big of a storm are you capable of weathering?

There are scores of players who were fantastically skilled when their ships were sailing out in the open waters of running-good. But they could not handle the storm that hit them, and went broke. It is the oldest story in poker, and though it happens again and again, this story always goes untold, unremembered. Narratives in poker revolve around the successful, the upward spiking graphs and the smooth, continuous winrates. The masses of poker seek these stories out, they selectively inundate themselves with these stories, as though to blanket themselves from the harsher reality.

But this is the way it is. Poker is a fickle mistress.

So let us say this: skill and winrate in poker is not measured merely by how good you are when you are running well, but also by how good you are when you are running poorly. That is simply part of your overall winrate, when abstracted over the long run. So if you look at a sample of your winrate while you're playing well and running well&mdash;that winrate isn't your true winrate, because it's skewed positively.

When you are downswinging, you will always play worse. How much worse?&mdash;that depends on your emotional skills in being able to brave downswings. So we must ask the more pressing question. What tools do we have to handle our downswings? How can we strengthen those emotional skills?

Imagine your worst downswing. Take a moment and try to remember. Think about the weeks, or months that it dragged on. Losing day after day. Constantly having to lower your sense of progress&mdash;you'd lose one day, hoping to recuperate it the next&mdash;but you'd only lose more, and more the next day, on and on. The feeling that maybe you weren't good anymore, that you had been wrong all along, or maybe you lost the skill you once had, or maybe everyone else got better. The feeling that poker was punishing you, a feeling of overwhelming, indiscriminate injustice. But worst of all, the feeling that you were moving backwards. That you were no longer climbing the mountain. That you were beginning a slow and indefinite descent downward, and that things might never turn around.

All of these feelings create a feedback loop. Because you are running bad, you lose confidence, you believe you're never going to win again, you play worse and tilt more, which all makes it more likely that you're going to continue to lose. Thus, the cycle self-perpetuates, feeding itself, like a snake eating its own tail. I call this phenomenon **Poker Hell**. Once you descend into this cycle of losing, tilting, and more losing, how do you ever break out of it? Obviously, one has to run good&mdash;but because you're in Poker Hell, you're inherently going to play worse, and your winrate is going to be depressed. Thus, you would have to run *better* than you would otherwise, since any positive variance is tapered due to these negative effects. So the better question is this: how do we climb out of Poker Hell, so we can hit the escape velocity out of our downswings more easily?

To answer that question, let's pull back and more closely analyze the actual mental processes in downswinging. There are two major types of negative effects caused by downswings: the first type is short-term negative associations, and the second is disruptions in one's self-narrative.

First, we will look at **short-term negative associations**. Let's begin with the obvious. A downswing is a stretch of time over which you are repeatedly given negative feedback, regardless of what you do. Because a downswing is a deviation from perfectly calibrated feedback (that is, rewarding correct behavior and punishing bad behavior), the natural effect is that a downswing is going to miscalibrate your senses. You are going to learn&mdash;at least in the short term&mdash;certain things that are simply incorrect, but which have been impressed upon you by repeated reinforcement.

For example, a common thing that people learn while they're downswinging is that &ldquo;he always has the nuts against me,&rdquo; or that &ldquo;I never win with [x] hand or in [y] situation,&rdquo; or even more obtuse claims like &ldquo;I never win flips.&rdquo; Of course, to a non-downswinger, a lot of these claims sound silly. But to the downswinger, these claims are actually the product of his conditioning. He has *learned* these things by the feedback that poker is giving him, through simple trial and error. And, in a sense, such a thought is not stupid&mdash;it is simply what his unconscious mind, which is constantly receiving and integrating information, has learned in the short-term.

Because the unconscious mind adapts quickly to new information and changing dynamics, the player &ldquo;feels&rdquo; many things are true that a non-downswinger knows are not true about poker in and of itself. And as you may have experienced, even if his *rational* mind knows that objectively it's not true that he never wins flips, he still cannot resist his unconscious premonition. He can't help but *feel* like he's going to lose every flip. It looms over him, and affects his behavior, as well as his emotional responses.

The sorts of behaviors that are engendered by downswings are, for the most part, risk-averse. Downswingers tend to stop making high-variance bluffs, they stop being as creative or experimental, they prefer low risk-reward situations to high ones, and they try to prevent from getting into situations where they can make mistakes.

In animal psychology, there is a similar concept known as &ldquo;learned helplessness.&rdquo; If you take an animal and place it on an electrified mat that delivers electric shocks at purely random times, from which the animal cannot escape, the animal essentially undergoes a depression. Once it realizes that there is nothing it can do to change its fate, it hunkers down, stops expending energy, and simply accepts the pain that it's going to receive. It has learned that it is helpless, and therefore not to expend energy or to take risks.

In a downswing, you experience very much the same thing. Because your unconscious mind has learned that &ldquo;nothing works,&rdquo; you stop trying to make plays or take risks, and simply hope to wait it out until the good side of variance arrives. Exerting dominance over your opponent is integral to good poker, but it is the first thing to go out the window in a downswing.

So we understand the problem. What can we do to circumvent this?

To some extent, this phenomenon is intractable. You cannot prevent your unconscious mind from learning from short-term patterns&mdash;it is too absorbent for that. The mental distortions that are caused by long fluctuations in variance are thus inevitable, and no functioning human brain can escape them. Downswings and their negative effects are simply part of our lot as poker players. But there are a few things we can do to mitigate these effects.

First, *win*. This sounds simplistic, but it's profoundly important. Once you start winning, your unconscious mind will unlearn its distorted negative associations. Of course, that's the catch-22, isn't it? If you're downswinging, you have no *control* over whether or not you win. But there are a few things you can do to give your winrate an extra nudge forward, re-assert a feeling of control and mastery (which will retrain your unconscious mind to start taking more risks and play more masterfully), and get yourself back to winning.

For one, you can move down&mdash;even if you don't need to for bankroll management. I would recommend even moving *way* down. If you're playing $2/$4 and going through a brutal downswing, a week of playing $.50/$1.00 would likely do you a lot of good&mdash;it will make it much more likely that you win, feel a sense of control and mastery over your opponents, and thus it will straighten out a lot of your negative mental distortions.

Secondly, you must force yourself to start taking more creative risks, in order to re-sensitize yourself to a wider range of possible behaviors. A downswing is naturally going to clip your wings when it comes to creativity, because your creativity is being consistently punished. Especially when you're playing lower, since it'll be easier with smaller amounts of money to make creative plays, forcing yourself to take such risks is going to undo that short-term conditioning.

A third thing you can do is game select harder. Again, this seems obvious, but it also will have the effect of nudging your average winrate higher, as well as your sense of mastery and control over weaker opponents.

The fourth third thing you can do is to try to focus on *process* rather than results. This is a very important idea in poker, which will be reiterated when we talk about learning. If you force yourself to accept punishment and reinforcement on the basis of *playing well* and *making the right decisions* rather than on winning pots, this will lessen your susceptibility to mental distortions by downswings. If you are process-oriented, then even if you're downswinging, what you will care about is whether you make good plays or not, even if you lose those pots. On the other hand, if you're results oriented, when you are running bad, you are going to continually accept and process the negative feedback from losing pots, even if you're making the right plays. If you consider your likelihood of making correct plays as a base degree of variance, and the likelihood of your plays working as a higher degree of variance, then if you're results-oriented, you're resigning yourself to accept more variance in your self-reinforcement, meaning you will also have more &ldquo;mental downswings,&rdquo; or mental distortions.

Consider an EV graph, in which your winnings and all-in EV lines deviate substantially from each other. Of course, it would be nice if your winnings line were glued to your all-in EV line. Mental feedback works the same way. Your mental feedback has its own winnings vs. all-in EV line, but we would call winnings &ldquo;results,&rdquo; which has more variance, and all-in EV &ldquo;process,&rdquo; or &ldquo;making the right plays,&rdquo; which has less variance. So if you could *only* make your mind interpret whether or not you made good plays, rather than their results, then you'd greatly dampen the effects of a downswing&mdash;though, as I said before, it's impossible to fully stamp them out.

So those are the short-term effects that we feel from downswings. The second major aspect of how we are affected by downswings is **disruptions in self-narrative.**

Self-narrative is a very important idea in the psychology of identity. According to some theories of self, the way that we make sense of who we are as individuals is through constructing our personal narratives. That is, even when we change in dramatic ways or undergo shifts in consciousness, what unifies our sense of who we are is the narrative thread that winds through all of our life. We carry this narrative continuously through our memory, changing it bit by bit as time progresses. This is how we make sense of who we are&mdash;through the stories we construct about ourselves.

As a poker player, your identity is to some extent tied to your success in poker. Poker is what you do; it might be your calling, your craft, or your passion. So when you succeed at it, you are validated, and when you fail at it you are failing yourself&mdash;at least, this is the underlying unconscious emotion for many.

So during a downswing, your self-narrative becomes disrupted. Up until now, poker has been the story of your continuous ascent&mdash;you started off with nothing, not knowing even the rules of the game, and now here you are, half-way up the mountain. Not a week of playing poker has gone by without you learning, improving, changing. But a downswing is a reversal in that narrative. In a downswing, suddenly you feel like you are going backwards. Like you are losing progress. Your self-narrative, instead of one of growth and ascent, becomes one of stagnation and degradation.

That self-narrative affects you deeply! It's not simply what you think about when you passively reflect upon your life. Your self-narrative is what you *feel like* your life is doing. It's your sense of tomorrow when lying in bed at night. It's your internal compass of purpose and growth.

In a downswing, it feels as though you are going downward. Of course, you are, in a literal sense. But for most good players, downswings are aberrations from their true winrates. They *should* be winning, but that fails to assuage them. They just feel the down-ness of the downswing. This prevents them from an overall feeling of optimism about poker, and more importantly, they lose a sense of personal well-being, of motivation, and so on. This affects their monetary EV, but also much more importantly, affects their happiness.

So how can we defy this effect?

Here, we have to utilize the power of **mental frames**. A mental frame is a perspective, or interpretation from which to view reality. We're going to analyze frames in a lot more detail in the following section, but for now we will consider the stereotypical, well-worn example, taking a glass of water: one can see a glass as being half-full or half-empty, depending on how you choose to interpret it. A simple shift in mental frame makes all the difference in how one perceives and feels toward the glass of water.

In the same way, self-narratives, being stories, rely tremendously on mental frames. Generally a downswing is going to create the mental frame of &ldquo;nothing is going right; I am getting punished when I should be rewarded; I don't deserve this; I am going downhill; I'm losing money,&rdquo; and so on. Generally, a downswinger tends to feel entitlement, victimization, and that they are in decline.

But let's try to reverse these perspectives, solely using mental frames. That is, let us take the exact same set of facts, but interpret and contextualize them differently&mdash;more advantageously. Let's say that instead of thinking &ldquo;I am getting punished when I should be rewarded&rdquo;&mdash;the entitlement frame&mdash;we replace it with &ldquo;how I brave this downswing defines me as a poker player&rdquo;&mdash;which is instead, a challenge frame. Then instead of &ldquo;I don't deserve this,&rdquo; the victimization frame, we replace it with &ldquo;everyone has downswings; this one is mine; I knew it was coming eventually, and now it's simply here&rdquo;&mdash;an acceptance frame. Closely related to the acceptance frame is the progress frame: instead of &ldquo;I am going downhill,&rdquo; we think &ldquo;I am making progress through *this downswing*.&rdquo;

I call this last notion the **fog of variance**. One of the fundamental reasons why downswings are so difficult is because we believe we are the *only* person getting punished unfairly. No matter what good we do or how well we play, when we're downswinging, poker seems to punish us and only us. There are two ideas in poker regarding variance&mdash;the first, that we create our own graphs, but the second, that we are also victims to variance's whims. People tend to vacillate between these two ideas, never really choosing one clearly (and probably the truth is somewhere in between). But the most fruitful answer is to fully take on both.

Instead of imagining that poker is a monolithic entity that treats one person fairly and another person unfairly&mdash;some murky, mindless god of variance&mdash;it is valuable instead to isolate poker for each person. If you are facing a downswing, instead of thinking &ldquo;that's not fair that poker chose *me* to face this downswing,&rdquo; instead take on the frame that &ldquo;this downswing was inevitable. This downswing is part of my mountain. Eventually I would have to face a downswing of this exact proportion and length; it happens to be right now.&rdquo; It is like climbing up a mountain and finding an upcoming portion that is going to be especially tricky and time-consuming. Does a mountaineer curse and say &ldquo;I don't deserve this part of the mountain; this is unfair that the mountain did this to me&rdquo;? Of course not. To a mountaineer, that is simply *part of the mountain*. It makes no sense to talk about climbing a mountain if you are going to complain about it having difficult parts.

But why does poker feel different? It feels different, because in some part of our mind, we imagine that we don't *have* to have downswings. Things *could* be different. Variance could simply &ldquo;choose&rdquo; to be kind to us.

And there is, in fact, some truth to that! But nevertheless, that perspective, that mental frame, is extremely deleterious. We must instead choose the fog of variance frame. We must imagine that, in fact, our graph of variance has already been written for us. There is no moment-to-moment re-deciding, re-shuffling, but instead the variance that is going to hit us is like a mountain that we have already begun to climb. We cannot see the variance that is going to hit us&mdash;it is obscured by a layer of fog when we look up. But nevertheless, we must know (or pretend) that it is going to be there, that it is simply *part of what it means to play poker*, and therefore that we inherently accept it the moment we choose to play.

 Then there's the last frame, the frame of monetary decline&mdash;&ldquo;I'm losing money.&rdquo; A stubborn downswinger might interject at this point in our discussion, &ldquo;how could I re-frame that? If I'm losing, I'm losing, that's just a fact. I can't delude myself on that point.&rdquo;

But think for a second how we delineate downswings. If a winning player loses over a week, he'll announce &ldquo;I'm having a week-long downswing.&rdquo; What this really means is that he has defined his local self-narrative as restricted to what's going on in *this* week, during which he's been losing. Thus, he has defined his self-story as starting within the period of this &ldquo;downswing.&rdquo; But let's imagine he's won the previous three weeks. Why do we accept that he's having a week-long downswing? Why don't we say that he's breaking even over two weeks? Or on a three-week, or four-week upswing? It's completely arbitrary where we draw the starting point of our current self-narrative. This is true even drawn over a month, or two months, and so on.

So if your lifetime career graph has been going up, and for the last month it has been going down&mdash;why are you deciding that you are on a downswing? Why not instead choose to reframe as that for the last four months, you have been winning? Or, hell, that since the beginning of your career, you have been killing it?

So the final and most powerful mental reframe is what I like to call &ldquo;**it's all one long session**.&rdquo; Because it's completely arbitrary where we begin or end what we call our downswing (that is, our local self-narratives), we can choose to draw those lines anywhere&mdash;then let's choose at the beginning and ends of our careers. So every session you play, you're not entering into any new upswings or downswings; there are no special episodes dividing up your experience. You are simply in the same continuous stream with which you began, which is your entire poker career. And so you do not need to take responsibility for individual days, or weeks, or months being bad or good. You do not need to experience all of that as individual episodes in your story. Instead, accept the entire story, from beginning to end, all the time.

It sounds nice, right? But it's easier said than done. Can you actually *identify* with your entire poker career? Can you actually sit there after a losing session, and think to yourself &ldquo;well, my lifetime career has gone pretty well&rdquo;? Clearly, it's not easy. But this reframe is a skill that can be learned, given honest and deliberate practice.

In the end, everyone at a poker table is fighting for something. Some are fighting for money, some are fighting for fun, some are fighting for self-respect&mdash;there are many motivations that drive a poker table. But what is a person who is on monkey tilt fighting for? What is it that he most wants?

Money? Not really, no. When a tilter is on furious tilt, he is generally in the worst possible position to make money&mdash;and many times, he moves up to higher stakes, and plays people against whom he knows he's not a favorite. Let's say that there's an 80% chance that he loses a lot, and a 20% chance that he gets even. If we assume that he knows what he's doing, and is acting according to his incentives&mdash;what is it that he really wants?

What he wants is precisely this. He wants to alter his self-narrative. He wants to escape the story he's living. Once this player hits his downswing, the entire episode will feel to him like one continuously painful event. On the 20% chance that he gets even on the day, he can escape that pain, obviously&mdash;but even on the 80% chance that he loses a great deal of money, he will lose so much that he's no longer in the same situation monetarily, and therefore will **reset his narrative**.

Have you ever lost so much money that you felt like you were in a new place? That everything changed? That suddenly, you had to re-take stock of yourself and start over?

This is resetting your narrative. It is pushing so hard through the other side that you feel, perverted as it seems, almost… refreshed. It is forcefully creating a new chapter in your personal narrative. It is, in a strange way, a relief. You no longer have to associate with the decline you were feeling before&mdash;everything has started over. It's like throwing out your old wardrobe, or moving into a new apartment, or making a list of New Year's resolutions. It's an arbitrary place that makes you feel like everything's brand new, and pristine. But here's the point&mdash;no matter how arbitrary and artificial it is on its face, you fully experience that difference! You truly feel released from your story. By monkey tilting in this way, you ensure that you will experience a **mental reframe**. The only problem is, from a second-order perspective, it's not a good way to go about doing this, since it sabotages our long-term goals. Rather than sacrifice a lot of money to reset our narrative, we'd much rather try to impose our own mental reframes.

Since mental narratives are how we make sense of ourselves, mental reframes are, essentially, rewritings of our stories. We've seen many of these stories that are advantageous to adopt&mdash;but how does one adopt a new story? Simple. By telling it over and over again. This is how that narratives function. Why did the ancient Greeks believe in stories of Zeus and Apollo, never having seen any evidence for them? They believed it because of the power of the storytellers themselves. Stories gain their power by being told, again and again. With enough sincere tellings, the story itself becomes more and more convincing, to the point at which one must suspend one's natural disbelief.

So consider the stories you keep telling yourself. They may not be obvious, but if you turn them over in the light, you will reveal them to yourself. Examine these stories, and consider how you can revise them to better frame your mental life. And therein, with practice, you can rewrite the lived experience of your journey.

#### VI

We've begun to explore the use of frames, but let's explore the concept in more detail. Frames are enormously powerful tools, and they are essential in mastering our mental life. There are a couple of classic gambling experiments in behavioral economics that shine some light on this phenomenon.

Consider this first experiment. In this setup, a subject starts with no money, and he is told that he has two choices. He can either take a 50/50 gamble between winning $20 or nothing, or he can choose to go home with an assured $10. The EV of these two propositions is the same, of course&mdash;and you might correctly guess that the vast majority of subjects choose the assured $10. This seems to suggest that people are mostly risk-averse.

Now, let's say you switch around some of the variables. Let's say that instead of starting with no money, the subject *begins* with $20. Now he has two new choices&mdash;he can take a 50/50 gamble to either keep his $20 (+$0) or lose it all (-$20), or he can accept a guaranteed loss of $10, so he'll have $10 remaining. Which of these do you think most people choose? Turns out, most people choose the former. Most people choose to gamble in this case, to try to keep everything. Perhaps then, in some cases they're risk-prone.

But if you are an astute observer, you will notice that actually *both of these experiments have the exact same outcomes*. In both cases, if you take the gamble, you have a 50/50 chance of walking away with either $20 or $0, and if you don't take the gamble, you're assured $10. Not only the EVs, but the actual *outcomes* are equivalent. Yet, in one case most people avoid risk, and in the other case, seek it. Why is this?

We could say simply that people are irrational, but again, this is a dismissal of complexity. We would do better to instead assume that people are responding to actual incentives in their behavior. At its essence, risk aversion means that winning a certain amount won *feels less good* than losing that same amount *feels bad*. Consider a poker example: when you choose to forego a slightly +EV flip that is so big it would make you anxious, your decision is not necessarily irrational&mdash;you are simply optimizing for your feelings rather than for money. In the same way, these subjects *are* responding rationally to their incentives&mdash;but we might argue that according to their second-order desires, those incentives may be undesirable. In poker, what we ultimately want to do is to reconfigure our first-order desires so that EV takes precedence over feeling, or otherwise, change our feelings so that they better align with EV.

The idea of changing our feelings and our relationship to EV is a very important one, and we will return to it later when we discuss learning and self-conditioning. For now, we will focus specifically on this phenomenon of perceiving wins and losses.

So these aforementioned experiments show the power of framing something as losses or wins, but there's also a more subtle point to be made. Notice how in each experiment, we gave the subject a different amount of money to start with. Of course, the starting amount is immaterial&mdash;the subject's outcomes will be exactly the same. But if you tell a subject he starts with $20 as opposed to $0, this gives a subject a **reference point**. Reference points are mental and emotional anchors with which we orient ourselves. By controlling the reference point, we can control the mental frame with which we view an object or a situation.

Even experts can be swayed by reference points. Experiments have shown that when medical professionals were proposed with hypothetical procedures which had a &ldquo;90% 5-year survival rate&rdquo;, or &ldquo;10% chance of death within 5 years,&rdquo; even though these are functionally the same information, experts reacted to them very differently. The way information is presented very strongly affects how it is processed. The use of framing and adjusting reference points is widespread in advertising and politics, as well as the arts of rhetoric and persuasion. But for our purposes, we must narrow our focus on poker, on money, and on EV decisions.

The former experiments suggest that there are some patterns when it comes to risk-seeking behavior. When people perceive that they are even, or starting from scratch, they are more likely to be risk-averse; but when people think that they are threatened to lose what they already have, and need to protect their winnings, they're more likely to be risk-prone&mdash;they would rather risk a loss than definitely diminish their winnings.

Of course, you know by now that the relationship between risk-aversion and risk-proneness is complex. It depends on the player in question, how tilted they are, whether they are at risk of wiping out their winnings or simply diminishing them, and so on. But the important point is that reference points play a big role in risk preference.

Turn this back on yourself. When do you tend to be risk-averse? When do you tend to be risk-prone? Everybody has triggers to make them more likely to be one or the other. It is important to first understand which situations trigger a shift in your risk behaviors.

It's likely that when you're down a lot, you tend to be more risk-prone, and when you're up you're more risk-averse. This is fairly common. This is because of attachment to specific reference points over the course of a session, like being &ldquo;even,&rdquo; or &ldquo;up [x] buyins.&rdquo; For example, if you're up 2 buyins and are put in the situation to make a large 3 buyin bluff that's giving you somewhat +EV odds, but will wipe out all of your winnings if called, most people will avoid making that bluff. They will be risk-averse. And yet, if they simply wait 6 hours and start a new session, they will likely be okay with making the bluff. They will become more risk-prone by simply including a 6 hour gap between these two hands.

Notice, then, how &ldquo;the current session total&rdquo; functions as an implicit reference point. But as I've said before, where we draw the lines starting and ending what is our current session is arbitrary. Some people are really attached to only single sessions, and some are attached to an entire day's session. What this really means is that one player is picking a new reference point with every session, and the other type of player is keeping the same reference point from his session earlier in the day&mdash;he won't want to wipe out his winnings from earlier in the day. Let's give a name to these units of time after which we choose new reference points: we will call them **periods**.

So how can we manipulate reference points and periods to our advantage?

We've already seen that the periods after which we choose new reference points are arbitrary. There is no intrinsic reason why we should choose any specific period over any other. But we don't *arrive* at our specific period arbitrarily&mdash;it arises out of our mental conditioning. Programs like PokerTracker and HoldemManager, daily graphs, Excel sheets, and the simple phenomenon of telling somebody else how much we're up or down on the day&mdash;all of these help to reinforce the idea of the *day* as being the natural period, and thus suggesting we adopt daily reference points.

But is this advantageous?

Theoretically, there should be an optimal level of risk proneness for each of us, dependent on our bankrolls, our emotional stability, and the types of games we're playing in. But if our level of risk proneness or risk aversion causes us to make suboptimal plays, then clearly it's detrimental, and we should try to change it. If you think about it, having reference points tied to your *daily* session is going to very often cause fluctuations in your level of risk-proneness (since your reference point will continually change) and therefore it will create deviations from the optimal amount, not to mention the emotional swings that it will put you through.

So, instead, let's try to untangle our local self-narratives from our *daily* winnings. Let's stop thinking about how we do on any given day as &ldquo;what we're going through.&rdquo; Try setting your PokerTracker or HoldemManager to show you your weekly results by default, or your monthly results, or your lifetime results even. Imagine what would happen if you broke the paradigm of daily results as how you experience poker.

Again, a new narrative can be imposed over an old one by repeatedly being told in its stead&mdash;so tell yourself this story, again and again: how I do today doesn't matter. There's nothing special about today. It's all one long session! If I end up down on the day, or up on the day, that doesn't matter&mdash;what matters is whether my overall bankroll is on its way up or down. It's all the same thing. It's all one long session.

Another example of the influence of reference points is in quitting behaviors. There was a telling experiment done on this phenomenon with New York taxicab drivers. In this experiment, they surveyed how many hours the cab drivers worked during busy days, and how many they worked on slow days. Of course, a cab driver's hourly rate is going to increase substantially on busy days, so it would seem to make sense that they should concentrate their hours on busy days, and slacken on slow days. But this is the exact opposite of what was observed.

What they would do instead is work *fewer* hours on busy days, and *more* hours on slow days. Why?

It all has to do with reference points. For the taxi drivers, the average amount of money they made in any given day was their internal reference point. So unconsciously, they were aiming to get *about the same amount of money everyday*. On busy days, they made a lot of money quickly and took the rest of the day off, and on slow days they worked long hours to try to ensure their usual paycheck. Their reference points were causing them to pursue very suboptimal behaviors, in order to satisfy their reference points.

In poker, you can observe the very same phenomenon. People love to quit when they're up past a certain threshold, which feels like a &ldquo;good win,&rdquo; and they hate quitting when they're down&mdash;some will keep playing indefinitely, until they're forced to stop. This is the same reason why. Unconsciously, we are actually aiming to win about the same money everyday, and to play about the same amount everyday&mdash;when clearly that is not the optimal strategy.

The optimal strategy would be to play as long as we can on the days where we're winning (not only because we will be on our A game and especially confident, but also because if we're winning, we're likely playing bad players, tilted opponents, etc.), and then to quit early on days where we're losing.

Consider your own mental life. What are your quitting patterns? What amount of winnings feels like &ldquo;a good enough win&rdquo; for you, that you're comfortable quitting on it early? How much of a loss is so small that it doesn't really feel like a loss, and you can quit essentially even?

We have a constellation of these internal reference points&mdash;but ideally, we would want to do away with them altogether, and to act purely disinterestedly in our daily continuity. Our second-order desire is to optimize our winnings in the long run, which means to keep playing through upswings, and to quit early when we're taking a beating.

Again, the mantra is the same&mdash;it's all one long session. If you're having a losing session, or a winning session, it doesn't matter, because it's all just the tiny little tail end of your lifetime graph. If you can see it that way, and choose *only* to make choices to continue to play based on the quality of your games, then you will optimize your playing behavior.

The direct consequence of this perspective is that playing marathon sessions to get even makes no sense anymore. What do you mean &ldquo;get even?&rdquo; If you're down 10 buyins in one night, what's so special about trying to win another 10 buyins tonight? Why not try to win them back tomorrow? Or tomorrow and the day after? The next 10,000 hands will be dealt to you with the same EV regardless of when you pick them up, so what's so special about this night? Except, of course, that tonight you will be playing worse&mdash;implying that the logical answer is to get some sleep, and play again the next day, and the next.

Another powerful mental frame that is a corollary this is the one of **winning your hourly**. The idea of winning your hourly is simply that you *know* that you have a certain average hourly rate&mdash;perhaps you calculate it to be $100/hr, and let's say you're down $1,800 on the night. Well, if you want to play a marathon session to get even, according to this perspective you would say to yourself&mdash;well, why? If I play for another hour, I'm only making $100 on average (plus, I'm tilted and tired, so it's probably less than that). It's going to take me 18 hours on average to win this money back. Is that really worth it? The answer is usually&mdash;probably not.

Inevitably, one of the difficulties with shifting your perspective on these reference points is that it's impossible not to, on some level, know how you're doing during any given session. Even if you shut off your tracking program and don't look at your bankroll&mdash;you're always going to have a good idea of how much you're up or down, if you're even minimally observant. So how can you resist not wanting to finish up or down, if you can't shield yourself from this?

Well, this is the raw challenge. There are no special tricks or shortcuts&mdash;one simply has to force oneself to frame reality differently. Once you accept that frames are powerful and vitally important to performance, then you cannot brush aside your responsibility over them, along with the difficulty of controlling them.

It is up to you to master yourself, and to strategically alter these perceptions.

#### VII

&ldquo;Ego&rdquo; can be a dirty word when it comes to poker. It's obvious that ego drives many poker players, but many people have the underlying feeling that to be driven by ego is somewhat juvenile, or even base.

The truth is, many of the greatest men and women of history were driven by ego&mdash;not exclusively, of course, but the desire for greatness and self-creation is one of the oldest and most powerful drives in human history. Poker players are no exception to this. Money is not nearly as motivating, as aggravating, or as profoundly exciting as the process of self-creation. Ego is important, and we would be remiss if we did not consider its role in the mental life of a poker player.

Now, my intention is not to proselytize on behalf of the ego, or to say that it is &ldquo;good&rdquo; to be egotistical. My point is merely that ego drives an *enormous* amount of the work and energy that great players pour into honing their games. We should acknowledge the existence and power of ego&mdash;but we should also try to curb it, and indeed, to harness it when we can.

Almost all of the great players I have ever met were driven more by their egos than by money, at least initially. For a long time, I have wondered why that is. When I was coming up in the poker world, playing low stakes, I ran across many people whose only goal was to make a lot of money, to become ballers, to afford an expensive lifestyle, and all the rest. But few of these people ever seemed to make it. Why is that? What is it about ego as a principle that makes it a sustainable motivator?

I suspect that it's because, in reality, poker is not an easy way to make money. This sounds counterintuitive, because chances are, if you're reading this, you're fully sold on the notion that poker is a great way to make money, and you may have even made a decent bit yourself. But in reality, most people don't make money in poker in the long term. Not only that, but most people end up busting their entire bankroll once, twice, or more before they end up becoming successful. Poker is not easy. And if money is the only thing motivating you, there are numerous points along the average poker career at which point poker will simply not seem like the best option to take when it comes to financial success&mdash;for most people, it will make more sense to invest oneself in school, or work, or other endeavors to try to make money.

But maybe it's even more than that. Why is it, after all, that we don't see great poker players emerging out of poverty? Why don't they come out of the slums of China, or India? Why isn't it that out of the billions of people who truly would *need* the money, who are most hungry for the money, among whom many must be intelligent, hard-working, steadfast, it simply doesn't seem to happen? Well, you could argue that this is partly because online poker culture hasn't disseminated into those areas&mdash;but you observe the same thing even in the first world. Online poker players seem to be largely post-adolescents with no dependents, and they don't emerge out of the lower class.

There's something about ego that makes it a more powerful driving force than money or success. I cannot claim to know why that is, but it seems to be true. We'll talk about this notion in more detail when we discuss the life of a poker player.

So maybe you think you are primarily driven by your ego, maybe you think you are not. But ego plays a role in every poker player's life, and no matter how equanimous or &ldquo;Zen&rdquo; you consider yourself to be, ego affects you as it does the rest of us, at least on some level.

When we talk about **ego** in the context of poker, what we're referring to is essentially the sense of ourselves as being better than others. We inherently want to be better than other poker players. And when that sense of superiority is challenged, some people react more strongly than others, either emotionally or behaviorally. We would describe these people as having bigger egos.

In psychology, there is an idea known as **horizontal** vs. **vertical** skill improvement&mdash;the idea being that if you think of skill horizontally, you think about how you're improving your skill relative to other people in your field, whereas if you think of improvement vertically, you think about how you're improving relative to where you were yesterday, or last month (generally, it's said that men think of skills more horizontally and women think more vertically). In a game like track and field, one is free to think of one's skill development vertically, if one so chooses. You can simply measure your own personal best times, over and over. But in poker, I would argue that you cannot&mdash;your success and the value of your skill is contingent on your opponents. Somebody who's successful in one situation against certain opponents may not be successful against other opponents, and the same level of skill may mean a lot less 6 months down the road. Poker is a more complex and chaotic system in that respect.

So to some extent, thinking of our skill horizontally is inescapable, because it's tied to the structure of poker. It's starting to sound like ego is inherent to poker, then. We've also noted that it is an extremely strong and sustainable motivator. So what's the downside of ego?

The downside, of course, comes when one's ego gets assaulted&mdash;primarily by losing. If a poker player has an extremely strong attachment to his ego, he may react violently or aggressively against the possibility of being worse than he thinks he is. He may tilt, have an outburst of anger, or make other unwise decisions when his sense of himself as being better than his opponent has been penetrated.

Not only that, but ego can have the effect of clouding one's accurate self-evaluation. If you have an unchecked ego, you may think you are better than you really are, which causes you to play in bad matches, not to recognize your own weaknesses, not to quit matches when you're losing because you're unwilling to admit it, and thus spew off money in the long run.

So there's a dark side to ego as well. But my argument here is that ego cannot be done away with. It is too important to the journey of playing poker for us to squelch our egos entirely. Ego, at its best, is a powerful force, though it can become harmful when unregulated.

Let us not try to throw it out, then&mdash;but let us temper it. I have always believed that self-awareness is the single most important skill for a poker player to have, and ego plays a big role in that. To be self-aware in this sense is to accurately be able to look at yourself and say, &ldquo;This is where I am. This is what I'm bad at. This is what I'm good at. This is who beats me. And I could be wrong about this, too.&rdquo;

When you're playing a match, the most valuable mental skill one can have is the mental belief that &ldquo;this guy might be beating me.&rdquo; No matter how bad he is, or how much you think that he fundamentally misunderstands some important concept, or how badly he played this hand or that, you must ALWAYS be willing to accept that it's possible that in this match, right now, right here, you have a negative winrate.

Notice how I speak of winrates, and &ldquo;beating,&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;being better than.&rdquo; It is unfruitful most of the time to talk about &ldquo;being better than,&rdquo; except in cases of drastic differences in skill, because poker skill is non-linear. You might have a positive winrate against 3-4 strong regulars at your stakes, but lose to the worst regular&mdash;simply because something about him throws you off, and you're just not adjusting correctly. Don't think about skill as being linear: not only because it's not, but also because it creates unnecessary assaults on your sense of self.

Rather than trying to dissolve your ego, subvert it. If you are losing against someone, it's not necessarily because &ldquo;you are bad.&rdquo; It's simply that your style has a negative winrate against that particular person's style, and so you need to do your homework and figure it out. But the fact that his style beats yours needn't be integrated into your ego. It's not a fact about &ldquo;you.&rdquo; It simply is.

One must always be able to acknowledge the possibility that one has a negative winrate at any given time, and to be able to quit a match with grace. And you may even say to yourself afterward, &ldquo;I don't know if I was losing or not&rdquo;&mdash;that's fine. But when you walk away from that game, your ego that is going to be burning, driving you to improve, to figure out what you did wrong, and to amend your mistakes&mdash;so that when you return to that person's table, you will be ready to rise above him.

I concede, the idea persists, even for me, that ego is somehow bad thing. Sure, maybe everybody needs a certain amount of ego when coming up in the game&mdash;perhaps without it, nobody would be motivated to get over the initial plateaus of becoming a serious poker player. But once you get there, once you start climbing the mountain, what use is ego? Maybe *then* it should be extinguished.

Don't get me wrong&mdash;I am no Randian in this matter. I don't believe that ego is the be-all-end-all, or that selfishness is the highest value men can pursue. But there are two senses of ego that we're operating with here. One is ego as a motivation, as a driving factor; the second is ego as a personality trait&mdash;as narcissism, and self-centeredness. Clearly, the latter is undesirable, and the two are probably correlated. But they are not the same. Ultimately, I do not believe that the desire for greatness, indeed, the desire for self-actualization, can be divorced from ego.

So, yes, let us try to be good to people. Let us be honest, let us be genuine, let us care for others around us. But this does not mean we extinguish our ego&mdash;instead, we partake in a different kind of ego. A selfless ego.

To become a great poker player requires inspiration. You must push yourself through darker depths, and into greater choruses of concentration than ordinary people put into just about anything. It is not about money. No poker player becomes great because of money. It is about *you*, it is about creating yourself&mdash;and at the same time, it has nothing to do with you, it is only poker, it is only the climb, only the mountain. Selfish, and selfless at the same time.

So take ego seriously. Be ready to lose to many people, over and over, throughout your career. No matter how successful you've been, and no matter how bad you want it, no matter how smart or precocious you are, you are going to lose to people, and that's fine. But I would say to you&mdash;hunger nevertheless. Hunger to be better. Hunger to be the best. Let that boiling desire bubble up in your belly. It is good for you. It is the spring from which you draw your energy. And it will guide you to grow and evolve into the kind of poker player you want to be.

Poker, at its highest level, is an art form. Of course, the traditional notion of art is restricted to things such as painting, music, and the like. Yet, you will occasionally hear people speak of a beautiful baseball swing, or a sublime mathematical proof. In poker, we also speak of beauty, though we sometimes use different words for it&mdash;&ldquo;sick play,&rdquo; &ldquo;a soulread,&rdquo; and so on. What we apprehend as beauty in poker, I would argue, is the masterful demonstration of creativity.

Where does creativity in poker come from? What role does creativity play? And how can we try to be more creative?

In a sense, it's natural to be creative. Think about it. When you first began playing poker, just about everything you did was creative. You experimented, you made plays you'd never made before, and you were unafraid. It is only over time, as you learned what you shouldn't do, that your creativity began to be stifled. By the time you become a fully capable and disciplined poker player, you are no longer even aware of just how restricted you are by your conditioning&mdash;at that point, you can no longer even see all of the available possibilities. When you are dealt AA preflop, you don't see limping as a possibility&mdash;it has been culled completely from your perception.

Imagine that poker is a wide open field. Your &ldquo;game&rdquo; is a set of trails etched on top of this open field, which restricts the space available to you. Imagine them restricted by walls, keeping you inside of their bounds. Instead of simply being able to roam freely, you now only move inside the space you've delineated. This is for good reason! You put up these walls to protect yourself from unsafe, –EV plays. The structures become your own self-imposed map, insulating you from the dangers of losing money.

But once you reach a basic level of proficiency, you realize the structure you've built is not perfect. Hypothetically, there is some better shape that your trails can take (the shape of a perfect poker game), but your structure doesn't capture that shape&mdash;you suspect it extends out too short in most places, and perhaps too far in a few (it is easy to see when you are overstepping the bounds of safety, but hard to know when you're understepping).

Creativity arises naturally from the simple process of trial and error, of making plays and learning from their results. And while you are in the process of creating the structure of your game&mdash;when you are deciding where to draw your boundaries, it is natural and easy to be creative, to test your limits, and to take risks. That is, in a sense, the easy part.

It is after those parts of your game have hardened&mdash;when the cement has been laid so long ago that it is now solid and immovable, that creativity becomes a real challenge. If you perceive limping AA as an unacceptable choice, if you have walled it away, how are you ever going to find out if limping AA is, in fact, the best play?

You might wonder why I'd use such an obtuse example&mdash;&ldquo;of course limping AA is never the best play,&rdquo; you might say. Ah, but that is precisely the way that errors are perpetuated! You and I both know that open limping AA is never good in a cash game. It is a wall that you and I have both built, and that wall happens to align perfectly with the shape of +EV play. However, *you don't know* which of your walls is misaligned with +EV play&mdash;it could be a wall that seems just as obvious as the one that dictates you should never limp AA. Since it is a solidified part of your game, it is something that you pass over in silence; it is a tacit assumption, an unasked question.

When you have overstepped your bounds, it is usually obvious. When you are making bluffs that don't work, or plays that get easily countered, you immediately receive negative feedback, and so you know where you are leaking EV. It is hard not to be aware of such problem spots in your game. But generally, far greater than the spots in which you're hemorrhaging EV are the spots in which you're unaware of the EV that you *could* capture. You don't receive any negative mental reinforcement for missing out on EV you didn't even know existed; the only effect of understepping your bounds is a smaller winrate (than it could otherwise be).

In a very important sense, you *can't know* where you're understepping your bounds. This is the state of nature for a poker player. You are missing value, and you don't know where.

To be creative, then, is to go exploring for that value. And the only way to explore new spaces for value is by *pushing past your mental walls.*

So how does this manifest in reality? What does it mean to &ldquo;push past a mental wall&rdquo;? The transgression of a mental wall manifests in your game as fear. It is the feeling that something isn't right; it is discomfort. It is the same thing that stops you from overbetting the pot by 2 buyins if I instructed you to do it. It's not that you'd think to yourself &ldquo;this is –EV,&rdquo; although maybe you'd be able to convince yourself of that if you thought about it&mdash;but viscerally, the moment you moved the slider all the way to the right and considered clicking, before you ever did any mental math or digested the theory, your *body* would recoil. It is this physical, psychic wince that I want to focus on.

I call it **the pang**. The pang is what happens when a potential play scares you. It's the stone that drops in your gut. It doesn't matter what you label this feeling&mdash;fear, discomfort, whatever. If you have played poker, you know what I'm talking about.

Of course, the pang is tremendously useful. It is what prevents you from making plays you know to be bad! Without the pang, you'd probably go off and do every stupid play that ever occurred to you out of boredom, or curiosity. Using the conscious/unconscious framework we discussed before, the pang is basically the unconscious mind's method of regulating your play. Where the conscious mind disagrees with you, you will feel stupid&mdash;where your unconscious mind disagrees with you, you will feel the pang.

If the pang is what happens when you traverse a mental wall, then to be creative in poker is to push past the pang. To overstep your bounds, you must *accept* that the pang will come. The pang is merely a signal that your unconscious mind thinks you're making a mistake&mdash;that is, it is the signal that your internal mental walls forbid you from making such a play.

But *you* know that your internal mental walls are imperfect. Thus, if you want to move toward a perfect game, you must acquaint yourself with the pang. The pang is the mark of creativity. If you are making a genuinely creative play&mdash;if you are doing something you've never done before, a call you've never considered, or a raise that your unconscious mind has trained you against&mdash;the pang is the signal that you have come up against a mental wall.

You must *want* to feel the pang, then. The fear, the pain, the discomfort&mdash;it's the only way to know you're making progress. You must flirt up against it. You must slam your shoulder into it. And finally, when you are ready, you must step with security over the collapsed walls, and erect new ones. This is the way that poker evolves. There have always been rules that seemed ironclad&mdash;the way to play preflop, rules of betsizing and hand selection&mdash;one by one, all of those walls were torn down and rebuilt, always a little stronger, always a little farther out.

This is how poker and its players evolve. Just a little farther out each time. Taking one more step. Feeling one more pang.

#### IX

You probably have some notion of &ldquo;style&rdquo; in poker. It's the notion that stuff that works for one person's game may not work for another's. Consider some of the plays that other people do, which you don't. It's likely you attribute the absence of these plays to your &ldquo;style.&rdquo;

I'm here to tell you&mdash;style is a myth.

&ldquo;Style&rdquo; is a justification people use for not incorporating new plays into their repertoires. A poker player might say, &ldquo;oh, that's not my style. Maybe it works for him, but not for me.&rdquo; I won't deny that different game structures will require different plays&mdash;that's absolutely true. However, what I am challenging here is your *a priori* ability to differentiate them *without trying them out.*

 What would happen if you flatted AA to 3-bets instead of 4-betted it? What would happen if you started minraising everything preflop? Or limping everything? What would happen if you started overbetting every value hand 1.5x on the river? What would happen if you started min-4-betting your opponent's 3-bets?

If you don't know&mdash;then accept that you don't know. *Try it!* Experiment! Style is nothing. Experimentation is everything.

Ram your shoulder against your mental walls! This is the essence of creativity in poker. The greatest poker players I have ever known are the players who are unafraid of taking stupid risks. They are the ones who are suspicious of every wall they have built, until they have proven its sturdiness with their own shoulders. They are ceaselessly curious and transgressive.

Yes, they make stupid plays&mdash;and often! But through constant reinvention and innovation, they learn what works, and they don't take anything for granted that hasn't been proven through their own experience. They are not impressed with poker dogma. They don't care that &ldquo;they were supposed to go broke there,&rdquo; or &ldquo;that hand was supposed to be uncallable.&rdquo; The greatest players are the ones who make uncallable calls, and unfoldable folds&mdash;*not because they know they are right, but because they want to know.*

And, yes! To be such a player, you must sacrifice some EV. You must accept that sometimes you will make terrible plays, you will lose huge pots. You will be unsafe. You will move into the landscape of fear and uncertainty. But it is by pushing through that fear, by groping into that darkness that you will understand how poker truly works. It is through creativity, and through taking risks that one can truly reach out and, for a moment, graze against the raw surface of the structure of poker.

While most poker players commit the mistake of understepping their bounds, there are a few who consistently overstep them (and we are all guilty of it occasionally). This is known as **FPS**, or **fancy play syndrome**. As the name suggests, it is the error of trying to make a complex or fancy play where the simple and obvious one would be superior. As far as being a *consistent* error, FPS is relatively rare.

So what can we say about FPS?

Despite the widespread use of this term, I think the name &ldquo;fancy play syndrome&rdquo; is a bit deceptive, because it seems to suggest that being FPS-y is being &ldquo;excessively creative.&rdquo; In fact, generally I would contend an FPS-y player has a shortage of creativity.

If you are making a play dubbed as FPS-y, what it really means is that you are attributing to your opponent some kind of thought process that is incongruent with reality. The most common example of this is the suicide bluff&mdash;a spot where your opponent puts a huge part of his stack into the pot with a clearly strong hand, and by going back over the top you try to make him fold it, despite giving him good odds on the call, because you think he'll put you on the absolute nuts.

  Now, here's the problem I have with calling this &ldquo;creative&rdquo;: chances are, if somebody is doing a lot of suicide bluffs (and hence is termed an FPSy player), really, he's not actually doing anything genuinely *inventive*. He simply has an overall tendency to misattribute other people's ability to fold huge hands, and that tendency is probably paired with an emotional over-attachment to investment. He's not making lots of different experimental plays&mdash;he's simply making the same speculative play over and over again, hoping eventually it will work, or that he'll stumble upon the perfect situation for it.

Creativity, on the other hand, is *trying out new stuff*. Of course, it takes a certain amount of introspection to realize when what you think is your creativity is really just you justifying a bad play that you often make&mdash;but this is part of the challenge.

If you are considered to be an FPS-y player, then I would say the most important two mental frames to keep in mind are &ldquo;people usually have it,&rdquo; and &ldquo;people don't fold when they have it.&rdquo; If you keep repeating these two phrases to yourself, you will relax a lot of your excessive and misguided aggression.

But if you are called an FPS-y player because you are genuinely creative, then I would say&mdash;keep on. Don't let the label deter you. As long as you are *learning* from your experiments, and consistently trying new and challenging things, then wherever you are in your poker career, you are going to evolve. Of course, chances are good that getting a good coach to help temper your experimentation would be a good idea. But if you choose to go it without a coach&mdash;simply do your best to learn as much as possible from your experimentation, and not to let failed attempts go to waste.

If, in the midst of small-talk, you ever tell a stranger that you're a professional poker player, you'll probably experience a familiar routine. Someone might talk to you about their friend's sister's ex-tennis coach who plays poker, or that-one-time-they-were-in-Vegas; they might ask you if you've ever been on TV, what your parents think about your career, or if you are really good at math. But the one that always arrests me is when people say, &ldquo;oh, you must have a really good poker face.&rdquo;

The &ldquo;**poker face**&rdquo; trope is so widely recognizable in our culture that it has become practically wedded to the game. If you know what poker is, you know what a poker face is. But the poker face represents more than what is commanded in poker. What we call a poker face would be familiar to the Roman stoic philosophers, to Zen samurais, to warriors and mystics and gamblers and thieves throughout all of human history.

The poker face is the mask of emotionlessness, worn over one's normal face. The poker face is to give away nothing of the trembling emotion that lies behind it. And perhaps eventually, like all masks, it will fuse to the face underneath&mdash;perhaps if you stop showing your emotions, you will stop feeling them as well. This is the mystique of the poker face.

The poker face is an inimitable human symbol. It represents rising above our animal selves. The poker face floats somewhere far above the game, detached from the fear, the anger, and the elation that the rest of us mortals seem to feel. It is part of the reason why &ldquo;poker player&rdquo; is such a fascinating, almost superhuman vocation to so many.

So when people ask me, &ldquo;how can I have a better poker face?&rdquo; I feel like I should have an answer. But what can I say to that?

The truth is, there is no way to have a better poker face&mdash;or, that is, no special way. Sure, mental frames help, and there are many little tips and tricks that one can use to mediate tilt and emotional potency and so on. Sure, you can practice in a mirror, visualize stuff, whatever. And yes, you should close your mouth, relax your muscles, stare straight ahead, breathe consciously, and all the rest. But really, these are small things. If you are somebody who has a lot of emotional weaknesses, then these morsels of advice aren't going to transform you any time soon.

Emotions are the jagged cliff-face of your mind, formed by years and years of erosion by the world. Some players, before they come to poker, have smoothed out their emotional edges, and have good poker faces, whereas others are still jagged and coarse, and seem to show everything. This is simply part of the genetic and environmental lottery. You have no say in it.

But once you have come to poker, the only way to smooth the texture of your mind is by the force of nature. The wind, the water, the passage of time, the thousands of hands beating slowly against you will sand down your emotions. That's it. So, yes, be conscious, be self-aware&mdash;learn how to mentally frame, co-opt environments, and other various techniques to try to ameliorate the effects of tilt and control your countenance&mdash;but, in the end, all you can do is wait. Keep playing, keep feeling, and keep hurting. If you stay here long enough, eventually your features, too, will get sanded away. It just takes time. Be patient.

But how can I teach you to be patient?

In the end, this is the only virtue that is fully in your domain. Be calm, let be what will be; but keep coming back. If you are emotionally weak, that's okay. Be emotionally weak, but keep playing. Keep trying, keep messing up. If you return again tomorrow, and again the next day, then this too shall pass.

You who feels he has no control, you who feels he is hopeless&mdash;I speak to you! You have no control whether you will tilt. You may be helpless as to whether you laugh, or curse, or storm away in dejection. But what you do control is whether you come back, and try it again.

Wait it out, my friend. Keep coming back. Because we were all once where you now are.

#### XII

So we've made a pretty thorough examination of emotion, tilt, creativity and fear&mdash;but we haven't yet looked at the actual experience of playing poker. Let's lift up the hood during a real session and think about what we really experience, and how to regulate ourselves while we are playing poker. Here I will offer some practical and straightforward advice.

A session begins before you ever sit down to play. Before you play your first hand or load up a table, you have already tacitly agreed to two things: that you will play at the time of day you are playing at, and that you will play with the mental state you are in. Those two factors have significant bearing on your expected EV over a session (and you should experiment with each, to see at what time/mental state you tend to play best).

The other aspect of beginning a session is the schedule that you have in place. Consider what activity you have just engaged in before beginning your session. Exercising, eating, stretching, meditation&mdash;these all tend to be very positively correlated with a good state of mind and brain chemistry, and are likely to be good times to start playing poker. Consider your daily routine, and how you can optimize it so that your poker sessions are optimally timed (and are followed up by similarly de-stressing activities to cool you down afterward).

Next, consider pre-session rituals. These are things you do immediately before a session begins, to get yourself into the right state of mind. They can include light stretching, breathing exercises, visualization, hand review, repeating a mantra to yourself, reviewing your goals, and similar things. It is not especially important that you do all or any of these things in particular, but I would advise experimenting with each to see what you find particularly effective, and to implement at least one. If you continually use these pre-session rituals before you play, a state of concentration will become a conditioned response (à la classical conditioning), so that even when you are naturally in a distracted state of mind, this ritual will nudge you toward concentration (like Pavlov's bell nudged his dogs toward salivating).

Now, let's look at the middle of the session.

Generally speaking, most of your sessions will begin near or on your A game. Being on your A game means a few things: one, that you're highly conscious and actively using your conscious mind; two, that you're fairly resilient to tilt, and are staying on your normal game; three, that you're capable of quitting when the time is right. The latter two are linked to the first, so let's examine this in detail.

First, what do I mean that we're using our conscious mind? Recall the distinction between the conscious and unconscious mind that we talked about before. Conscious thought processes are discursive, mediated through language, and tend to be slow. They are also somewhat synonymous with poker-theory analysis.

However, it is a fallacy to think that when you are playing well and are on your A game, that you are *only* using your conscious mind. Even when you are playing your best, you are *always* employing your unconscious mind on the majority of plays; your conscious mind is simply too slow and laborious to actually compute all of the hands you get dealt (and to be honest, you would probably find that process excruciatingly boring&mdash;imagine having to explain every c-bet or every preflop raise to someone). When your conscious mind is sharp and fully accountable, it is generally doing three things: one, it is processing in the background things like gameflow, reads, and opponent psychology; two, it is &ldquo;on call,&rdquo; in case a hand that needs analysis pops up; three, it is keeping tabs on your own mental state, and how the match is going. There are a few little odds and ends that your conscious mind might attend to, but these are the main things. When you are playing your A game, your conscious mind is maintaining this juggling act with finesse.

But what happens when we're playing our B game, or C game? The conscious mind doesn't simply get thrown out at this stage. It's still there; it's simply more tired, less sharp, and is doing less work&mdash;it might slow the juggling down to only three balls, rather than four. Perhaps it doesn't pay as consistent attention to gameflow and psychological profiles; perhaps it stops checking up on your mental state and lets you play a longer session because you're down; or, perhaps the threshold for hands that it's willing to analyze has gone higher. Of course, it's not as though it *won't* analyze any hands&mdash;when your unconscious mind doesn't know how to deal with something, it's going to hand it off to your conscious mind no matter what, but *slightly* or *somewhat* strange hands won't get double-checked as often, and you're more likely to simply use your unconscious mind's intuitive answer to a hand.

And what happens when our game degrades to our D game? At this point, our conscious mind has probably checked out&mdash;it's no longer checking up on our mental states, it's not trying to model our opponents, and it's certainly not trying to double-check our hands. Occasionally when we try to feed it a hand that needs solving, which is such a big or strange pot that we can't figure it out, it will offer us an answer&mdash;but chances are, that answer is going to be biased, since our unconscious motivations will bleed over into our discursive thinking: motivations such as wanting to get even, or wanting to avoid risk, or not wanting to be embarrassed. It is no longer easy to quit at this stage. Usually, it is only when our unconscious mind wants to quit that we will be able to, often when we feel so bad that we don't want to play any longer, or when we have given up hope of getting even.

Notice how there is a continuum here. In poker, we often speak of &ldquo;going on **autopilot**,&rdquo; but there is no single autopilot point, or on-off switch. The sharpness of your conscious mind will wax and wane over a session, and this process tends to be gradual.  So instead of speaking in binary terms like &ldquo;on your game&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;autopilot,&rdquo; we should instead consider this a process of **conscious decay**; the natural deterioration over a session of your conscious acuity.

As I mentioned before, your conscious mind is also a defense against tilt. But you probably know by now that most people are notoriously bad at detecting when they're on tilt. You can call it a cognitive bias (though I don't know of one specifically stated as such): most people tend to think that they're more immune to tilt than they really are. This includes you and me, no matter how smart or special we think we are. Being on your A game will help tilt-inducing phenomena to affect you less, but it does little to help you *recognize* once you've reached your tilt threshold&mdash;it's a bit of a catch-22, since hitting your tilt threshold is going to make your unconscious mind overpower your conscious mind anyway, preventing you from objectively realizing it. In other words, the point at which our *conscious mind* will conclude we are on tilt is usually a while after we've already reached it.

That doesn't seem to bode well for us. How can we improve our likelihood of recognizing and avoiding tilt?

First of all, there is a mental frame that comes in handy: if you are a habitual tilter, it is helpful to note to yourself before a session begins, &ldquo;I might tilt today, and one of my challenges is to stop myself before I tilt; if today is one of the days I will tilt, then if I quit before that, I will have accomplished one of my goals.&rdquo;

If you think about it, when you're tilting and your unconscious mind doesn't want to quit, your unconscious mind has two choices: quitting and feeling bad about your loss, or continuing to play and possibly feeling good by getting even. Again, let us not dismiss this behavior by calling it &ldquo;irrational,&rdquo; but instead let us assume that the behavior *is* rational, but simply responding to a different incentive structure than we'd like. By instituting the frame that *quitting before you tilt* is an inherently valuable goal that you can feel *good* about, you are adding more value to the payoff for quitting. You are creating the possibility that quitting *feels good*, which will make it more likely that your unconscious mind will naturally choose it.

The second way to ameliorate tilt is to use the environmental method (which tends to be stronger). By this method, instead of hoping your conscious mind will catch your tilt, you attempt an external override: essentially, you force yourself to quit after being down a certain number of buyins, or after a certain kind of event (such as being soul-read, if that is a tilt trigger for you). By co-opting an external mechanism to determine when we quit, rather than our internal overseer, we avoid the inevitable lag before the conscious mind admits we're tilting&mdash;but, of course, we must be able to obey the external rules we create. Programs such as *Tiltbuster* go a long way in helping to enforce stop losses beyond our control. These mechanisms are good&mdash;but I would say they should be paired with the former. Although they are good at restraining us when it comes to tilting, they do not address the underlying emotional weakness, and there is a lot of value to be gained, not just in poker, but in life in general, by improving our emotional skills.

To summarize, we have have seen that there are three domains of skill to cultivate in poker. We have already considered theory skills (conscious mind), play skills (unconscious mind), and in this section we have examined emotional skills (which draw upon both our conscious and unconscious mind). In the next chapter, we will go into more detail into how to best *cultivate* these skills&mdash;that is, we will explore the unexpected and complex processes of learning.

[For further reading into tilt and emotional self-regulation, I strongly recommend Jared Tendler's *The Mental Game of Poker*, as well as Tommy Angelo's *Elements of Poker*, and Larry Philips' *Zen and the Art of Poker*, which have informed much of my thinking on tilt and its antidotes.]

The embryo of this post has been sitting on my desk for several weeks now. Originally, it was a frenzy of thoughts that I scribbled purely for myself, just to flush the words out. But after seeing it on my desk day after day, I finally decided to post it here. I apologize if this seems self-indulgent, but it seems to me the right thing to do.

Several weeks ago I drove to Kaufman, Texas to volunteer on a 3-day Vipassana meditation course. The courses are run purely by volunteers, so I decided that I would pitch in my time, to pay back a bit of my due for the 10-day sitting I did in Europe.

I spent most of the days washing dishes, cutting vegetables, and meditating for the few hours I had left in the day. It was tiring work. But on the second night, after retiring to my room, even though I was wasted from exhaustion, I couldn't sleep.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G4hljPQshAU">[video]</div>

I would toss and turn and occasionally slip into a dream, only to be jolted awake again an hour later. In my dreams, people kept dying, and it was always my fault, and I would awaken suddenly, tense with dread. I kept trying to force sleep, but my mind felt like it was getting heavier and heavier as the night dragged on, like a net filling with debris.

It occurred to me that I had been having similar dreams for a long time now&mdash;ever since coming back from Europe. Dreams where I would hurt people, and then wake up terrified. And for some reason, in the silence and isolation of those nights, those dreams had come bubbling up to the surface of my mind, and I couldn't push them down.

I slipped on my jacket and let myself out to take a walk, hoping it would settle my mind. I tried to shake the thoughts that troubled me, but in the dimness, they only became more and more visible. Finally, I returned to my room in agitation, got out a pen and paper, and began to write.

![](http://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-P6pz2IOTovc/T3X70a4XO6I/AAAAAAAABOs/8PGPymnP8T8/s720/IMG_4605.JPG)

As I wrote, I realized how deeply ashamed I was. I wrote and wrote, and watching myself writing, I realized that I was still thinking about Jose. I was still carrying that shame with me. Even now, more than a year later after the scandal&mdash;a year later! So much has passed since then. I am almost a different person. I am living a different life. I am not even a poker player anymore, I thought to myself. So why is this sense of shame still lodged so deep inside me? It seemed in that moment like a splinter that, picking and scratching, I could never get out.

I thought to myself something that had never entered my mind before: don't you realize, Haseeb, that in the real world, people go to prison for doing what you did?

The thought chilled me. It made me feel like it was a grievous mistake to be who I am, living out this life. It made me feel deeply alone. All this time, I had been trying to think of ways to ameliorate my sins, of ways to forgive myself. Telling myself that I had acted out of fear and stupidity, out of self-preservation and the desire to protect my friends. We are all full of our private sins, aren't we? And yes, this one exploded with terrible consequences, but was that really the measure by which I should be judged? I know I am not a bad person, I would hear myself say. I was young. I am changing. I am bettering myself.

There, sitting in that bed in the near-dark, my legs crossed beneath me, it occurred to me that this is something that may follow me to the end of my life. That the decisions I made over those weeks are now public knowledge, things which just by knowing my name, anybody could find out. That when I am 25, 30, 40 years old, the events of those weeks will never go away. This is something that I will have to answer to forever.

And why shouldn't people ask me? Why shouldn't I have to confront, again and again, the mistakes I made?

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-vYS_5F8nu68/TrqLnA_NIZI/AAAAAAAABK8/-TuZiKyjsjM/s720/IMG_4156.JPG)

After I returned home from Kaufman, I made a list of people who I felt I had wronged during the events of the Girah scandal. I wrote to each of them, to let them know that I was deeply sorry, and that I was ashamed for what I had done. I asked not for forgiveness, but that they know my regret for having acted as I did.

But there was one thing that at the time I never acknowledged. And that was the poker community. It had always seemed like such an abstract and nebulous thing, &ldquo;the poker community.&rdquo; In the end, who had I really hurt? Out of everyone involved, I was the only one who hadn't actually directly cheated anyone. Who could anyone point to as having sustained injury?

The poker community felt like a far away, amorphous thing. Besides, I was never somebody who felt like he belonged to the poker world. I was not a typical poker player. Even when I was playing poker, I always felt like I was hovering somewhere along the periphery of the culture, neither inside nor out, skirting the edge between citizen and observer.

But recently, a student of mine told me something surprising after a mental coaching session. He told me that in the wake of Black Friday, the poker world has gotten much worse. Scams, thefts, angleshoots on bets, stolen stakes&mdash;all sorts of cheating have skyrocketed. New scandals seem to arise every week. It's as though everyone is getting desperate, he said. The age of abundance in poker is over, and the culture of honor is giving way to a culture of greed.

These things all make sense&mdash;as money supply shrinks, markets move toward efficiency, incentives of altruism shrivel&mdash;these are all things that most people intuitively understand. In fact, it is something that many poker players were forecasting even when I was still playing. In that sense, it is no surprise that this is happening. Perhaps we are entering a dark age of online poker&mdash;an age approaching market efficiency, and the breakdown of a once noble culture of gambling. Perhaps this is all simply inevitable, in a march-of-history sort of way.

![](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02128/Cezanne_2128852b.jpg)

But I can't help but think that the whole Girah scandal, as sensational as it was and as widely as it was covered, may have contributed. That my lies, which I have always wanted to see as small, self-interested deeds, may have in fact accelerated the dissolution of the poker culture I once admired, even if in a small way.

I had never taken it seriously before. It always seemed too theoretical, too political of an accusation&mdash;that I had wronged the poker world. But now, seeing all this, feeling all this, I can't help but feel that in fact I did. That in the end, I spit on the world that fostered me. As much as I have loathed the poker world, both when I was within it and without, the truth is that I owe it a big part of my life. The truth is that I could not have become the person I am without its community. And so it seems to me that it I have to answer for that too. No doubt, it is a case of too-little-too-late. But nevertheless I had to make it known that I am deeply sorry for the harm that I caused to the poker world, however large or little it may have been.

I can only hope that in time, with the rejuvenation of the poker economy, the poker culture can regain some of its former health. Good things are on the horizon, and the tides may even be turning now. It doesn't pay to be pessimistic. And though the poker world and I have never been on the best of terms, I have to say, when it was at its best, it was a goddamn beautiful thing.

title: Seven Things Poker Taught Me

I don't tell people these days that I used to be a professional poker player. It seems like a weighty and cumbersome admission, one that always leads to the same tired conversation. The last time I played a hand of poker was well over a year ago. That life feels like an episode long behind me&mdash;an identity I've left behind.

And yet sometimes, in my dreams, I find myself playing poker again, multitabling 25/50 and 50/100 heads up matches, battling the regulars. Sometimes I am sitting in the Aria cardroom, staring down a backwards-capped grinder, tracking the movements of his eyes. And whenever I wake up from these dreams, it always takes me a moment to remember that poker is no longer part of me&mdash;that my life is entirely different now. How long will it be until my mind lets go of poker? Will it ever?

I had a conversation with a good friend of mine the other day, and he asked me: *so now that you're done playing poker, what do you think you took away from it?*

Consider that.

What a fucking question, right?

I was a professional poker player for 5 years&mdash;from 16 till I was 21. How can I separate what I learned from poker from what I simply learned in the process of growing up?

Poker taught me a great deal. Poker was a maddening mistress, and yet it was also one of the wisest teachers a human could ask for. So I came up with the seven most valuable lessons that five years in the fray of poker taught me.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zqZm3Mmn-Co">[video]</div>

### 1. Poker taught me not to trust my own perception.

> Every man takes the limits of his own field of vision for the limits of the world.
> <div class="source">Arthur Schopenhauer</div>

Why do games run at all? In every game of poker, there are winners and losers. And for the most part, people only play in games that they think are profitable. So in almost every poker game, there must be a loser who doesn't know it. This used to puzzle me. How can so many people be deluded all at once? What's stopping them from realizing their own incompetence? And what makes me different from those people?

Many will blame this on ego, but that falls short of capturing the more startling realization&mdash;*your own perceptions of whether you're winning or losing can never be fully trusted.*

Perception is riddled with biases and illusions. Cognitive science, psychology, and neuroscience have demonstrated this again and again. The more we study it, the more we realize how fallible our perceptual apparatus truly is. I came to realize that I often saw what I wanted to see, that I involuntarily drew the same patterns over and over again&mdash;I realized that the fish isn't always a fish, that the obvious play isn't always so obvious, and how I can think I'm beating somebody who is, in fact, destroying me.

Poker is an industry that runs on delusion, and even though I was a pro, I knew that I was subject to the same forces as everyone else. So I learned to distance myself from my intuition, to carry my instincts with suspicion, and to always remind myself that what I thought was a sure thing… often wasn't.

### 2. Poker taught me how to control my emotions.

> I am, indeed, a king, because I know how to rule myself.
> <div class="source">Pietro Aretino</div>

Poker taught me to control my emotions&mdash;or perhaps it's better to say that poker &ldquo;trained&rdquo; me to control my emotions. In that sense, it's not so much a lesson as it is a process one undergoes.

![](snow_buzulq.jpg)

This lesson, I think, needn't be a pessimistic one, because hidden within it is a simple, almost obvious truth&mdash;that life is not about the destination, but about the journey. There is no conclusion, no great prize at the end of anything. There is only the movement, the climbing, the rack and tumble of living. So why do we choose goals? Why do we have dreams? It is not for the goals themselves, or the endpoints we imagine&mdash;but it is, instead, to orient the *process* of our lives.

This is a lesson that I am only coming to understand now. We are, by our nature, forward-looking creatures. But the most meaningful life is one lived in the present, without regard for its finality. Buddhists say that &ldquo;from the moment we are born, we are all racing toward death.&rdquo; And yet, they also say, &ldquo;he who abandons all hope rests content.&rdquo; Just as life is not about death, a path is about not about where it ends. Its value lies in the infinitely many points in between.

What is learning? How does it work? How can we learn better?

These questions might seem naïve on first glance. Learning is fundamental to how humans negotiate the world, and yet it feels strange and reductive to take it aside and interrogate it. But if you are a poker player, learning is an essential part of your vocation. To really improve at poker, it is imperative to optimize the process of learning.

It is possible to learn how to learn. This article will consider the different types of learning involved in poker, the science of that learning, the three most important techniques to optimize the way you learn, and, finally, the common mistakes and pitfalls that face every learner.

As a poker player, you have all sorts of resources readily available to learn from&mdash;videos, forums, books, and so on. Yet no amount of watching videos or reading forums will, on their own, make you good at playing poker. Why is this? Isn't poker, after all, a purely mental game? It's not like football or tennis; in poker, all you have to do is *know* what the right play is, and then do it. Yet why doesn't it feel that way?

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/laasoy84YLY">[video]</div>

## The Three Types of Learning

No amount of study will make you good at poker. This is because there are fundamentally different modes of learning involved in playing and in watching a video or reading a forum, some of which we established in Chapter 5. To return to some of those concepts, the three types of learning are as follows. First, there's *poker theory* or *knowledge*&mdash;what we might call *propositional *learning. This is the kind of thing you generally absorb from watching a video&mdash;it is your ability to talk about poker, all of your ideas about exploitation, combinatorics, game theory and so on. Then there's another type of learning, your *know-how* or *performative* learning&mdash;in other words, the ability to play *un*consciously. This is your ability to click buttons for two hours, instantly to think of the right play in the moment&mdash;your raw poker intuition. Third, there's *emotional *learning&mdash;often called &ldquo;*the mental game*.&rdquo; This is your ability to take losses, to play consistently, to follow your own rules and monitor your mental states. Although all three of these kinds of learning are essential and mutually reinforcing, they are profoundly distinct. If you want to develop your poker know-how, it is unlikely that engaging in an activity that develops your theory or emotional skills will be much help (although they may still bolster your overall game).

It is helpful to imagine each of these as essentially being composed of separate networks in our brains. While each of these networks contributes to the overall effect of playing good poker, these networks are *distinct; *each is strengthened and grown in a different way, by different stimuli, and are practiced differently. To draw an analogy, if you're a boxer, being good at your sport involves developing your stamina, your punching strength and your footwork, and so on. Although all of these skills together might be called &ldquo;boxing,&rdquo; all of these are distinct abilities, developed differently, and none of them individually could be called &ldquo;boxing.&rdquo; Yet they are each essential to the final boxer.

So, as poker players, we have three distinct skillsets that we have to develop: our poker theory, our poker intuition, and our emotional skills. How do we develop each of these individual skills? What's the best way to learn them?

In order to answer these questions, we will have to delve into a deeper understanding of the process of learning itself. This leads us to what I call the three-fold path&mdash;the three most important techniques that are essential to optimizing learning.

## The Three-Fold Path of Learning

### Risktaking

In Chapter 4 we discussed how the brain is composed of neuronal networks&mdash;networks of neurons. The interconnections that form among these neurons are strengthened by repeated firing, and are inhibited by inactivity. Through this continual firing and non-firing, networks are gradually borne out. These networks are our mental building blocks&mdash;it is in the shaping of these networks that all of our knowledge and capabilities are ultimately stored.

We can define learning as simply **any change to the connections in our neuronal networks**. Whenever a connection is strengthened or weakened&mdash;in any way at all&mdash;we will call that learning (barring changes caused by injury or malnutrition). You might protest that this seems overly inclusive. After all, sometimes your neuronal networks will be conditioned to make you play *worse*. If your brain convinces you that J4o is a lucky hand and you always win when you 4-bet it&mdash;that's a change to how your neurons interpret J4o, but do we really want to call that learning?

Absolutely. It is imperative that we don't prejudge learning, or take learning only to mean productive learning. Learning involves a lot of trial and error (emphasis on *error*), so learning incorrect plays is an inevitable and important part of the learning process, especially early on in the development of your mental network. For every bad habit you learn, however, the goal is to simultaneously learn two good ones.

Now, let's posit that there is some *ideal* neuronal structure, with a very specific shape. We can call this shape the &ldquo;optimal network.&rdquo; That network is essentially the brain of a perfect poker player&mdash;it is the structure of the perfect poker game. Your own network has its own shape, probably simpler than the optimal shape. If you superimposed your structure onto the optimal structure, like putting one transparency over another, you would be able to see all of the inconsistencies&mdash;all of the differences between your game and the perfect game would be apparent. You want to train your neuronal networks toward hammering out those inconsistencies.

This training happens naturally. Because the optimal network is the shape that makes the most money in the long run, you will automatically evolve toward this network. That is, simply by a process akin to natural selection, your game will gravitate toward the shape of the optimal poker game, just by getting conditioned by the never-ending feedback of making winning and losing plays. However, it is unlikely ever to get there on its own (if it did, just everybody who has played millions of hands would be a great player, and of course that's not the case). Why does it get blocked in its movement toward that optimal shape? There are many reasons&mdash;lack of selection pressures (not playing in tough enough games), persistent cognitive biases and misperceptions, lack of critical awareness, being motivated and reinforced by factors other than money (such as excitement, etc.), and, sometimes, hurdles of complexity (like having to evolve an organ that's ineffective until it's fully evolved). There are many obstacles in the way of the undirected learner.

Entertain a metaphor for a moment&mdash;imagine that learning poker is like a game of Minesweeper. When you start playing, your map of the terrain of poker is very naïve&mdash;you have no idea what's good or bad, everything just looks like an open field. The underlying reality (that is, the optimal, real map of poker) is very complex, but you're oblivious to all of that. You just see the blank Minesweeper game. The only way to get more information and fill in your map of poker is by starting to take risks. You must uncover new blocks in the map, and with every click you begin to locate mines (bad play) and open space (good play). However, unlike in Minesweeper, you do not lose the game when you make a mistake. Instead, you might lose a pot, but you are allowed to continue. At worst, you take a slap on the wrist. In this way, poker encourages us: take risks! Make mistakes! Spread out as far and wide as you can, to figure out what works and what doesn't. The more data points you have, the better and faster you will learn the terrain. The ideal approach to learning is one that uncovers the underlying field as quickly and diligently as possible.

Learning poker is hard. If it weren't, it wouldn't be lucrative. But this understanding of what learning poker *is* (that is, tempering the shape of our networks toward the optimal network), gives us valuable insight. The process is one of trial and error, continual feedback and calibration. Our goal in learning, then, is to speed up and optimize that process as much as possible. We want to maximize the data points, increase the rates at which our neuronal networks are altered, and we want to increase the retention of those alterations (i.e. make the learning *stick)*. This is true in almost any skill&mdash;if you are not continually testing your limits and challenging your boundaries, you are not growing as a learner. In fact, one study of Olympic ice skaters showed that the ice skaters who achieved the highest skill level were the ones who took the *most falls* during practice. Rather than taking a mistake to be a bad sign, take it as a sign that you're pushing the threshold of your skill level&mdash;which is exactly where you should be!

So the first key is that **we want to have a strategy that takes a lot of risks**. You're playing a game of Minesweeper, except you effectively have innumerable lives. Click around. Make mistakes. In the end, every mistake is an opportunity to gain new knowledge about the terrain, and to use it to your advantage in the future.

### Blueprinting

Of course, there are many differences between poker and a game of Minesweeper. One of these differences is that as poker players, we are not forced to start with a blank slate. We are given access to other people's maps of the minefield called poker.

How so?

Articles, videos, books, through interacting with poker friends or even just watching hands play out&mdash;they all give us valuable insight into *the way that other poker minds are structured*. Although looking at such things from the outside does not make us capable of emulating their poker mind (no number of hours watching Phil Galfond videos will make you play like Phil Galfond), it does allow you to see the overall *structure* and *organization* of their game. It gives you an idea of what a good map looks like, what it's composed of, and how different elements relate to one another. Instead of simply throwing darts on a blank board like a game of Minesweeper, it allows you to have some idea of approximately where and how things should be allocated, the way mines are usually spread out, what a final map probably looks like.

This is the second key: **to use blueprints to accelerate the shaping of our games.** With blueprints, we are able to learn leaps and bounds faster, and things like videos, articles, hand histories, and our relationships with other poker players allow us easy access to very powerful blueprints.

So how do we best take advantage of blueprints?

Consider the education of apes. In certain species of apes, when a young ape is trying to learn how to properly crack a nut, the mother will put her hands around the hands of the infant and *manipulate the infant's hands* to make it crack the nut correctly. This is called **shaping**. By shaping, rather than simply demonstrating visually by cracking her own nut, the mother is able to directly imprint on the infant's mind the proper technique, muscle memory, and timing of cracking a nut. It *primes* the infant to learn the correct technique on its own. Shaping in this way is much more powerful than mere demonstration; it gets the technique &ldquo;into the learner's body,&rdquo; so to speak.

So how can we take advantage of shaping in poker? The most prominent example is getting sweated. Being sweated by a stronger player is one of the most powerful methods of learning in poker, for the simple reason that it *instills the learning into your body.* If you are sweat and your sweat-er makes you do a check-raise you'd never ordinarily do, you will be much more able to perform the action in the future compared to if he merely pointed out the check-raise on paper. The simple act of clicking the button (and getting all of the table feedback of your opponent thinking, calling time, eventually folding his hand, you winning the pot) primes your poker-playing-mind to be able to make such a move again in the future. Of course, a sweat is more than one check-raise&mdash;in an extended sweat, you will assume a completely different player's style, logic, and attitude toward poker. Inhabiting the space of another person's mind will allow you viscerally to explore their blueprint of poker, and let its possibilities imprint upon your own mind.

Unfortunately, while sweating may be ideal for learning, real-time sweats may not always be possible. So when we can't do a real-time sweat, what can we do? Well, we can instead *simulate* sweating. We will talk about this in more detail when we discuss elaborative rehearsal, as the ideas go hand-in-hand.

Language is another invaluable aspect to incorporating a poker blueprint. The *way* that someone talks about poker reveals a great deal about the way that his blueprint is organized. As an experiment, try observing the differences between the ways Phil Galfond, Sauce and Jungleman talk about poker hands in their videos&mdash;what are the first things they talk about? What concepts do they continually invoke? The things they all tend to talk about, and in what order do they mention them? What do they *not* talk about? By analyzing these things, you will reveal a lot about the way they think about poker, and to what concepts they give the most priority. Although these three players would reach many of the same conclusions about certain hands, they have very different blueprints of how poker should be played and thought about.

The point is this&mdash;start speaking with the right kind of language, and the structuring of your poker thinking will follow. If you start speaking about poker the way Phil Galfond does, chances are, your play will start to gravitate toward his. So language is important. But how exactly does one learn to speak &ldquo;poker'?

Of course, apes are not the only creatures that shape their young&mdash;we humans do it too. When young children try to tell their parents stories, parents will instinctively guide their child toward the right way to tell a story. This is because children tend to rattle off facts&mdash;they have not yet learned how to create coherent stories. So a parent will lead them: &ldquo;why did Billy do that?&rdquo; &ldquo;And then what happened to Billy?&rdquo; &ldquo;What did you learn from all that?&rdquo; And so on. This is called **scaffolding**&mdash;the teacher provides a skeletal framework which leads the student towards the right kind of linguistic structure. Ideally, a competent poker coach will engage in the same sort of scaffolding. &ldquo;Why are you making this bet?&rdquo; &ldquo;What do you think he perceives your range to be?&rdquo; &ldquo;What inference should we make from the hand he just showed down?&rdquo; and so on. These kinds of questions lead the student toward having the right *structure* of thoughts, and prime him to follow a pattern (and perhaps ask those questions to himself). The scaffolding doesn't &ldquo;create the story,&rdquo; so to speak. It merely guides provides skeletal frameworks to which stories can be grafted.

Ultimately, blueprints must be utilized in conjunction with risk-taking and, as always, acquiring lots and lots of data. No matter how well you're following a blueprint, your poker game must be filled in with experience, and its blank spots must be filled in with raw data. The path to perfection is, as always, paved by playing hands, hands, and more hands.

### Elaborative Rehearsal and Isolation Drills

This brings us to the third key of learning: **rehearsal**; specifically, **elaborative rehearsal**. Elaborative rehearsal is the concept that when you are trying to learn something new, you should try to engage that learning in as many ways and modalities as possible, and relate it to other things you know. This maximizes the retention of new learning.

Say, for example, that you're trying to memorize this list of words: &ldquo;cat / farm / blue / chip / pave / tree.&rdquo; If you try to memorize this list using a shallow rehearsal then you'll simply repeat the list of words to yourself until you can recite them from memory. It will probably take you a while, and isn't very efficient. If instead you learn this list of words by creating a story and relating the pieces of information to one another&mdash;by *elaboratively engaging *all of the information and activating structures of meaning&mdash;you will learn the information faster, and retain it for longer. So instead of just a list of disconnected words, perhaps you try to create an image: &ldquo;There was a cat farm littered with blue chips and paved with trees.&rdquo; Or perhaps instead of simply reciting the words out loud, you practice writing them down, or creating a melody to accompany the list.

By engaging with the information presented to you in different modalities, you create stronger interconnections within or between the networks that already exist in your brain. Instead of having to forge a completely new network of knowledge (an auditory list of disconnected words), you take advantage of all of the other pre-existing networks that you can rely on to reinforce this knowledge and make its retention easier. You want your rehearsals (that is, your practice) to be *as elaborative**and engaging* as possible, and the same principle is fundamental to learning good poker.

Say that you are reviewing some of your hands in PokerTracker or HoldemManager. Your review method is to find your biggest losing hands, read them over, decide mentally if you made a mistake or not, and then move on. This is a very shallow rehearsal&mdash;there is a limited modality of engagement here, which is *reading a hand history*. The rehearsal becomes more elaborative if you do things like write down what you think your mistake was, or replay the hand in the hand replayer and imagine yourself playing it again. Simply visualizing the hand again will engage many more mental networks&mdash;the parts that are activated while actually playing&mdash;and make the learning more likely to stick. Anything you can do to engage the stimuli in more modalities makes you more likely to learn and retain the new information.

I should also mention, at the risk of stating the obvious, that when it comes to rehearsal, reviewing past learning is essential to retention. Once in a while, go back to your marked hands from last month or two months ago, and read some of them over again to remind yourself of what you've learned. Once in a while, read over all of your notes on your table nemesis, even if you feel like you know him like the back of your hand. Review is essential&mdash;so don't short-change yourself, even if you feel confident in your reads.

There is a second principle of elaborative rehearsal, which is **practice like performance**. According to this rule, to optimize learning we should make rehearsals as similar as possible to performance. If, for example, you are going to be tested on your ability to write down the aforementioned list of words on a test, what do you suppose is the best way to practice for that? By the principle of practice like performance, you shouldn't review the list again and again until you remember it, or try to memorize reciting the list verbally. The best way to improve your test performance is by *testing*&mdash;that is, by simulating the conditions under which you'll have to perform your knowledge. Studies have repeatedly shown that if you practice by repeatedly testing yourself using a quiz similar to the way you will be quizzed, this vastly improves testing scores over any other method of vocabulary retention. This insight has many implications for us as poker players.

After all, in poker, what are you studying for? What's the final performance? The performance is *actually playing**poker*. This means two things: one, we should deliberately practice our skills *while* we are playing poker, and, second, we should make our external practice *as close to the reality of playing poker as possible*.

Consider how most people watch videos. They sit idly, listen to the video-maker speak and almost zone out until they see/hear something really cool, or something they disagree with. Then they are engaged&mdash;but their engagement is primarily with the theory part of their mind. This is why watching a video is primarily good at developing your theoretical muscles, but not as good at engaging the *play* or *performative* skillset.

Remember when we talked about the value of sweating? Well, videos provide an excellent platform to mentally *simulate *sweating. If you watch a video while imagining that you're really playing the hands, this will activate a totally different network in your brain from the video-watching network (that is, if you visualize it correctly). You might then imagine that the video-maker is directly speaking to you and telling you what to do. There is a wealth of difference between sitting and thinking about the theoretical implications of checking your set to him on the river and actually *visualizing that you're doing it*. I would even recommend clicking the actual button on the screen, as though you were actually playing the table! This sounds silly because we are married to the idea that poker is a &ldquo;mental game&rdquo;; that it is one undifferentiated skillset. But in theory, every video is an opportunity wholly to inhabit the mind another poker player, and allows you to test your own physical and mental boundaries in a safe environment. All it takes is visualization and commitment.

Remember, again, the importance of fear and mental boundaries. Respect the difficulty it takes to click a button. You might think it's something trivial, but the difference between making a bluff that popped into your head and not making it is often simply *having experienced having clicked that button before*. If you've seen a certain bluff made in many videos, yet have never made it yourself, it is simply the fear of hitting that button that holds you back. Respect the physicality of poker! Something as simple as rehearsing going all-in or making a ballsy bluff by clicking a button on a frozen video can make a big difference.

Practice like performance. Anything you can do to make your practicing, studying, and preparation as close as possible to actual poker will maximize your learning gains. Your brain is not as smart as you&mdash;it can be tricked easily. Take advantage of visualization, multiple modalities, and elaborative rehearsal.

Finally, let's look at **isolation drills**. Earlier we said that if we want to make practice as close as possible to performance, then we should deliberately practice our skills *while* we are playing poker. Isolation drills provide us a way to do this.

The first and most obvious isolation drill is to simply **isolating attention**. If you want to practice 3-barreling, make working on this the focus of your session, and pay extra attention every time you barrel someone and there's a chance for a third barrel. In short, make your session unofficially &ldquo;about&rdquo; doing third barrels, and put everything else on the backburner. This might seem simple, but it's an invaluable tool in any player's skillset.

Remember the three types of learning? By isolating your attention, you can foreground your theory network or emotional network while playing. Let's say you tend to expect to lose every coinflip (emotional defeatism). You might play an isolation session, in which you practice mentally imagining that you'll *win* every coinflip. If you know you are weak in a certain situation and you know how to isolate and counteract your natural reaction, an isolation session can powerfully enhance your learning and development.

The second type of isolation drill is an **artificial experiment**. An artificial experiment is one in which you create artificial rules for yourself during the experiment, designed to test or practice a very specific skill. For example, say you have a lot of trouble fighting 3-bettors out of position. You might design an artificial experiment by moving down maybe one or two stakes below your normal stakes, and playing a session where you call every single 3-bet out of position and try to play well postflop. By isolating and continually exposing yourself to the situation, you will quickly increase your sensitivity and experience, as well as force yourself to challenge your preconceptions about what it's like to deal with such spots. Artificial experiments are not just valuable for gaining experience and improving your understanding of the underlying map of possibilities, but also for challenging and breaking down recurrent negative cognitions, such as &ldquo;it's impossible to play well when you call a 3-bet out of position.&rdquo;

To conclude&mdash;if you have a good strategy coach or mental coach who is guiding you in your learning process, ideally you should have a learning regimen that incorporates all of these aspects in tackling your poker weaknesses. But even without a coach, as long as you have the knowledge (and a little creativity), you can engineer a plan to attack your weaknesses yourself. By incorporating ample risk-taking, proper blueprinting, and effective rehearsal, anyone can optimize and speed up their growth as a learner of poker.

Poker cannot be played alone. For a game to be dealt, you must have other players to battle, to deceive, to outmaneuver, to control. And yet, every hand of poker you are ever dealt you will play alone.

No one else is in your corner. You may find sympathy in others, encouragement, words of wisdom. But you know they have no stake in your success. You are the only one who will feel your swings. Your ups and downs belong only to you.

Poker is played alone.

And yet, there exists a poker community: a collection of self-interested individuals who nevertheless teach one another, help each other grow, share ideas, feelings, stories. They sacrifice their time, their knowledge, and their EV to help one another. Why?

In this article, we will try to make sense of the poker community. First we will try to answer the question of how and why it exists. Then, more practically, we will look at advice on how best to get value out of the poker community, how to forge healthy poker connections, the value of coaching and mentorship, and how to exist sanely in the culture of gambling.

Let's begin with the first question, the one which has always fascinated me most. Perhaps the most fundamental axiom of poker is: &ldquo;always maximize EV.&rdquo; We internalize this from the beginnings of our careers. So why does something seemingly so at odds with that&mdash;the poker community, with its sharing information, helping other players&mdash;exist at all?

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NLb8jWYvYmU">[video]</div>

## Why Money Matters

The culture of poker offers us a strange system of values. First, we are meant to be dispassionate toward money in poker. They're just chips&mdash;we are supposed to be detached and objective. And yet, at the same time, we are supposed to be driven, to the point of obsession, in maximizing our EV.

If we're not supposed to care about money, how can we be monomaniacal about EV? And more importantly, why would we be?

Poker culture teaches us to protect information, to look out for ourselves, to be indifferent to up and downs. Here, the ideal human being is the ruthlessly selfish one. Poker drives us apart. After all, when you win a big pot from someone, there is no fanfare, nobody to congratulate you, no handshake at the end. Once you win a pot from someone, the only recognition you get is the new enemy you've made, sitting across the table from you.

Money is not important, we are told. Money is not the end. Then what is?

As in any other human endeavor&mdash;other people are the end. It is only through the poker culture that having a 6bb/100 winrate, or making an amazing hero call, or being the biggest winner at $2/$4 for a month becomes an accomplishment. Without other people to care about those things, they would simply be arbitrary facts. But here, they mean something. The poker culture instils us with a value system, it gives us a reason why money is important, why bb/100, and non-showdown winnings, and hero calls, and marathon sessions, and minute questions of poker theory&mdash;why they all matter. It is thus that the stories of poker are created and imbued with meaning. As humans, we need actualization, and poker culture gives us that.

This is why the poker culture *must* exist. Through it, a dry monetary gain is transformed into an accomplishment, something laudable, even noble. It is chiefly through the poker culture that your success truly matters. Your skill, your fame, your journey&mdash;in reality, they mean very little to the outside world.

Yes, you would be making money. But in a vacuum, making money means very little. Poker culture is the logos; the source of values. I contend that without the poker world, much of poker would be meaningless.

That is not to say that this is good or bad. It is simply how it is. And it is also not to say that you must derive *all* of your values from poker culture (there are some who do, and many who don't). But all of us who participate seriously in the journey of poker are in orbit of the poker culture. It's the sun that both propels us in different directions, and holds us together.

## The Value of Sharing Information

Somewhere in your education as a poker player, you learned that you have to protect information. You probably can't pinpoint where exactly you learned this. I certainly can't. It's one of those ideas that's so deeply ingrained into the culture of poker that it seems to have always existed.

Of course, you should protect information. Information is important. It's EV. Money. We realize the wisdom of this caution, and so we generally follow it. But we don't always. We *do* share information sometimes. We gush to other people about our poker ideas. We show hands instead of mucking. We discuss theory at the table. We trash talk. We post hand advice in forums and help out our friends when they have a tough spot. Really, we share information all the time.

Our desire to share information stems from our desire to commune&mdash;to participate in the poker community. In a sense, sharing information is the only way to puncture the veil between you and another human being. Those are the moments we brush our minds against others&mdash;we get to *feel* poker. After all, the game is not much fun without other people to play with.

This is not to suggest that you shouldn't protect information. It's important. You probably shouldn't show hands, you really shouldn't trash talk, and you definitely shouldn't discuss theory at the table (unless, of course, any of these are done strategically). But sharing information on the whole is very, very important. In fact, if you want to become a great poker player, it is absolutely essential, because it is the only real way to build a healthy and supportive poker network.

## How to Build a Village

When I first started playing poker, I was alone. I had no one to share my ideas with. I had no friend climbing up poker alongside me. After several months, I finally gained a companion or two, but it would always happen that, as I improved and climbed up the stakes, I continually left my poker friends behind. Almost always, I would become the best player within my circle, and would have to search for new companions who were stronger players.

I was not lucky in how I started poker. I knew none of the right people. It took me a long time to find good resources. I had no gifted companions to rise up stakes alongside me. I never won any tournaments, and could not deposit more than once. And yet, I quickly became successful. If you asked me why I think I became good at poker, I would give a few answers&mdash;obsession, competitiveness, intelligence. But really, those things alone are not enough. What truly saved me, I believe, was my ability to make connections with other poker thinkers.

That's not to suggest that I was great at it, by any means. I was 16 when I started poker, and woefully dense. But if I did not possess this skill, I suspect I would have had no chance at all of success.

It takes a village to raise a child&mdash;and to raise a poker player. You *have* to reach out to people. You *have* to find people to talk poker with. People to bounce ideas off, to learn from, to encourage you and make you feel less alone in this game. There is probably no single greater determinant of a poker player's success than with whom he talks poker.

Well, let's say you agree with all of this&mdash;but you don't really know anyone. You've learned poker on your own, you have no poker friends who are on your level. This was the position I found myself in time and time again. The task seems daunting. How do you start? How do you make your own poker network?

The answer is simple: *give*.

Find someone whose game your respect&mdash;they might be a regular in your games, a poster on a forum, a friend of a friend, whatever. Offer them something. Share information. Reveal to them what you had in a hand and what you were thinking. Tell them some of your reads. Offer your own tips that you think they'd find helpful. Offer to help them review hands, or to let them know when good games are running. There are many things you can do, even if you're an unknown player, that another poker player will appreciate.

You might think, &ldquo;why would I do that? Just give away information&mdash;especially to someone I play against? I might as well set money on fire!&rdquo; I hear protests like this sometimes, especially when I encourage solitary students to start reaching out to other players and expand their network. And almost every time, despite sounding pragmatic, this response is usually not motivated by EV. More often, it is motivated by a fear of rejection.

Try it. Just see what happens. Allow yourself to be pleasantly surprised.

But there are times when you really don't have much to offer someone. Times when they are so much better than you&mdash;and you both know it&mdash;that you have little of value to give him. In that case: compliments go a long way.

It might sound trite, but as I was rising through the ranks, I made a number of my poker connections that way. Not flattery, mind you&mdash;it does not help to be obsequious or fawning. Most poker players, especially successful ones, find that kind of attention obnoxious. There is an art to complimenting. In the end, all poker players want to feel *respected *for their accomplishments. Most of what they are looking for is not money, but esteem. So give it to them. Find a way to make them feel like they're the kind of person they want to be.

Such is the way to a poker player's heart. Deep down, we're more emotionally driven than you'd think. If you can make someone feel good about themselves&mdash;if you are honest, forthcoming about what you want, and can humbly but genuinely communicate your respect for them&mdash;there's a good chance they'll like you, and be willing to help you out.

Reach out. Make connections. No matter how smart or capable or hard-working you are, you will never become a world-class player on your own. It takes a village to raise a poker player, but unless you were born into one, it is up to you build that village.

## Coaching and Mentorship

I remember one day, when I was an up-and-coming $10/$20 and $25/$50 regular, I tilted and played a long session against a very good nosebleeds player at $50/$100. He and I had never really talked before, but in that session he completely destroyed me. It felt like every hand he knew just what to do, how to rise above me again and again, every right call and every right fold. My game felt maddeningly futile. Eventually I was down $150K&mdash;my worst losing day ever at the time&mdash;and I quit him.

But the story doesn't end there. I sat out, but I didn't leave. I started talking to him. I told him that he was the best player that I had ever played. I told him how much I admired his game. I told him that he had just given me the worst beating of my life&mdash;and I wanted desperately to know how he did it. I asked him to teach me. And he did. He became one of my coaches, and eventually, a friend.

It doesn't matter how good you are. And it doesn't matter if, right now, things are great or terrible&mdash;finding a coach is vital to growing as a poker player.

There is only so much that you can achieve through playing, reading, or watching videos. A good coach can shine light on parts of your game that you'll never otherwise be able to see. Coaching is now so ubiquitous in poker that extolling its virtues any further would be unnecessary&mdash;if you don't have a coach by now, get one. Maybe see your coach just once a week, or once every two weeks&mdash;but see someone. Always have that eye over your shoulder. No matter how good or bad things are going, you always want a second pair of hands guiding your development.

Be thoughtful with choosing a coach. Choose someone both who is a successful player and a good teacher (i.e., is intelligent, articulate, versed in theory). Bad players never make good coaches, but good players can sometimes be bad coaches. Look for people with communication skills and teaching experience. And, just as importantly, *choose a teacher whose style you like*. If they've ever made videos, written articles about poker, or whatever, be sure to research them first and make sure you feel like a good fit. Don't be afraid to ask for a consultation beforehand, just to feel your coach out.

And once you're working with a coach, be sure to prepare before your sessions! When I was a strategy coach I taught over 100 poker players, and, consistently, the students who put in time preparing learned much more in any given session. Knowing exactly what you want to ask, which hands are giving you trouble, which aspects of poker theory you need help on, or pre-recording videos against the kind of villains who bother you is great for maximizing your value as a student. And, most importantly, grill your coach. He's there for *you*. If there's something you don't fully understand or agree with, don't be afraid to argue with him or call him out. It will not only train you to better engage in poker argument and navigate theory, but it will also keep him on point and prevent him from being sloppy. Remember, coaches make mistakes too. Keep your mind engaged, and your questions sharp.

Your relationship with coaching should not just end with hiring a coach. If you want to be a great player, I recommend that you yourself start teaching. It doesn't necessarily have to be professionally, or for money at all. But actually mentoring another poker player will teach a great deal about how to articulate theory, how to understand and mold another player's mind. It also sheds light on how your own poker mind works. A student will see your ideas and your logic with beginner's eyes. He will often, merely in the process of trying to understand you, teach you something about yourself that you never knew. Teach and be taught. The two are instrumental in developing your poker mind and keeping it sharp.

Many of the greatest lessons and &ldquo;eureka!&rdquo; moments that I had as a poker player came from teaching others. It forced me to refine my thinking, to explore and defend my thought processes in a way that I would never have had to do alone. I would say that teaching a challenging and incisive student is one of the best ways to deliberately practice your poker theory skills.

## This is Water

As a poker player, the culture of poker is all around you. Its values, its ideals, its language, its attitudes, its history. You've been swimming in it since the moment you entered this world. Whether you want it or not, poker culture is your inheritance. But it is up to you to take that inheritance and make it your own. If you are to be a professional poker player, this water will be your home. So make it yours.

When I was playing, I was a very atypical poker player. I didn't really identify with poker culture. It teemed with values and attitudes that I didn't want to accept&mdash;so I didn't. Never accept any value that you do not yourself choose. If you don't want to be ruthlessly self-interested, don't be. If you don't want to be materialistic, don't be. If you don't want to be misogynistic, or to make light of degeneracy, or to be pessimistic about the goodness of people, then don't. You are free to choose.

Poker will change you, no doubt. It changes everyone who accepts it as a part of their life**.** But you must be conscious of what you won't let it change about you.

In all of the poker culture that I've observed, if I had to choose one most valuable caution I could give an upcoming player, it would be this: don't gamble. If you go down the path of a poker player, you will be constantly surrounded by gambling. Blackjack, prop bets, sportsbetting, roulette, craps. Or gambling within poker&mdash;taking enormous shots, buying huge pieces of someone that you can't afford, entering a tournament with half your roll.

That poker players gamble in casino games has always baffled me. It is, in a sense, the antithesis of poker. Poker is a game in which we repeatedly put down our money with the knowledge that, even though this hand may be random, we will win out in the long run. Casino games are the opposite&mdash;every play whittles away at your EV. Playing casino games contradicts what it means to be a poker player.

One could argue that prop bets and sportsbetting fall into different categories, being skill and knowledge-based. While this is true, I recommend against them for an important reason. Once you start prop betting or sportsbetting, it is difficult not to let your gambling extend into other arenas. It sets a mental precedent that some gambling is okay. The brain already has enough trouble regulating itself when it wants to do something.

I have seen numerous players who started with sportsbetting or prop betting, thinking they were being strategic, and who wound up having gambling take over their lives.

As poker players, we often think ourselves immune to such a thing as a gambling addiction&mdash;we're not addicted to gambling, we're running a business, we tell ourselves. This may be true for many of us. But it is unwise to tempt that boundary. We are all merely human, and gambling is very good at sneaking up on us, desensitizing us to it, and making it a part of our lives.

But, as we all know, there are many times when gambling is necessary. Sometimes the fish wants to gamble. Sometimes everyone at the table is starting to partake in sidebets, or straddling, or whatever. In this case gambling is fine&mdash;but only within the context of being *strategic within a poker game*. As long as you obey this rule, you can keep your relationship with gambling in check.

In many cases, however, we tend to think we need to gamble more than we actually do to appease the fish, or the table, or the moment. The reality is, you can elect out of a lot more than you think you can. So long as you are sociable and confident, you would be surprised how easily you can get away with a &ldquo;no thanks, I don't gamble like that,&rdquo; or a &ldquo;no thanks, I don't like to drink when I'm playing,&rdquo; etc. If you turn things down with *confidence*, remain positive and friendly, people will respect you and want to play with you. Yes, gamble when you need to, take a drink when it's necessary, but don't surrender every decision to them.

You're a professional. Treat your life with dignity&mdash;let your body be a sanctuary to your mind. It is all you have. It is your only refuge. The better you treat it, the longer you will last in the poker world.

For the next and final article, we are going to discuss the last, but most important part in what it means to be a poker player&mdash;how to live. How can you live a good and healthy life as a poker player? How should you make sense of yourself? What should your relationship with money be? How should you deal with people outside of this world? How can you find peace? How can you be happy? I won't be able to answer all of these questions for everyone, and in some sense, what I can tell you comes less from expertise than from personal perspective&mdash;but I will offer what insight I can, and hopefully, lead you closer toward your own answers. Look forward to it.

Nobody teaches us how to be poker players.

Poker culture teaches us how to slowplay, how to setmine, how to manage our bankroll. It teaches us how to think, how to talk, what is cool and what is not. We absorb these teachings eagerly. But when was it going to teach us how to *be* poker players? What to think of ourselves? How to thrive in a culture that is built on degeneracy?

If you know the lives of many professional poker players, you know this question is not too paternalistic.

Professional poker is a strange and isolating life. Nothing you have ever done before will prepare you for it.

Over my career as a poker teacher, I have taught many things. But one thing I regret never emphasizing is the importance of living well as a poker player. This will be my attempt to rectify that, and recount everything that I think every poker player ought to live by&mdash;and what I wish I had heard when I began playing poker 7 years ago.

I will discuss many things within this series of three articles, but I will begin with: first, how to structure your poker sessions, then the art of quitting, how to pace your career, the importance of keeping poker fun, and how to avoid envy and learn to be happy for others.

We will begin with practical things we can do to maximize our performance, most of which are backed by research and studies, and some of which is based upon my experience of working with poker players. I will attempt to answer the question&mdash;how should you structure your poker sessions?

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ys2gR3Ud_iA">[video]</div>

## Structuring your Poker Lifestyle

Freedom is a double-edged sword. Your freedom as a poker player means you can live almost any way you want. The downside of that freedom is that, in the modern world, a lack of responsibilities tends to move us toward unhealthy habits. As human beings, we tend to take the path of least resistance. And in the modern world, the path of least resistance is to live an unhealthy and unstructured life.

Structure is extremely important. As adept as you may think you are at playing poker at any time of day, studies show that structure and regularity are very beneficial to learning and attaining mastery. Remember, you alone are in charge of your poker playing. You must therefore self-regulate in almost every respect. It becomes much more difficult to control tilt, marathon sessions, or other forms of bad poker judgment without a defined structure to keep you in check.

Set a daily schedule for yourself. Decide when you're going to play poker, and for how long. I recommend not playing any sessions for longer than 3 hours, and taking a short break every 90 minutes. Studies show that there is a drop in performance quality and mental acuity around the 90 minute mark; taking a break and refreshing yourself, for just 5 minutes if you can, will make you much sharper throughout the entirety of your session.

If you want to play more than 3 hours a day, break it up into multiple sessions. Put enough time between them that you don't feel like the sessions bleed into each other. I.e., resist the urge to think &ldquo;I have to get even from my first session.&rdquo; Your sessions should feel independent, and putting time between them will make that easier.

Always play at the same time everyday. Plan these times out in advance. If it is difficult for you to keep to these times, try setting timers (kitchen timers are especially effective, due to their physicality). Try not to play extraneous sessions, especially not serious ones. Train your brain to think &ldquo;this is when I play poker. Only at these times.&rdquo; Allowing yourself to play sessions at other times will circumvent much of the mental conditioning you've accrued in playing during your normal sessions. That is, you'll feel more like you can &ldquo;bend your rules&rdquo; if it doesn't feel like a &ldquo;real session.&rdquo; Thus, when you break your structure, you will be much more susceptible to tilt and bad decision making. Don't take the psychological effects of your routines lightly&mdash;they will help you immensely in controlling tilt and maintaining your level of play.

Play tough matches sometimes, but not all the time. Sometimes take it slow and just play weaker players. Whenever you are playing tough matches, do so consciously and intentionally. Focus on the game. Know what you're doing and what approach you're going to be taking, what you'll be experimenting with, what you're going to try to exploit. Focus on learning.

Always review sessions, ideally on a daily basis, with a thorough review at the end of each week. Go over hands in detail. Remind yourself what you did wrong and how to change it. Don't review your session immediately after you finish it, though&mdash;your memory is too fresh, and you'll be biased toward thinking that your reads were correct. Give some time in between; the next day is usually best.

Spread out onto as many sites as you practically can. Download every program that seems vaguely useful to you (Pokerstove? PokerEV? Tiltbuster?). Don't procrastinate on getting acquainted with any of them. Every day that you hold off on trying out a potentially helpful program, or moving onto another site, you are bleeding away money. Employ every possible tool. Search for every conceivable edge. It will only make your life and poker career easier.

Choose your rituals, and stick to them. What do you do every morning when you wake up? What do you before you start your sessions? What do you do when you take breaks? Rituals allow us to divest much of our anxiety and negative emotions. Always engage in rituals of some kind before your sessions. And by ritual I don't mean they have to be spiritual. They simply have to be consistent&mdash;choose a little routine that prepares you to play, and then stick to it.

## The Art of Quitting

A great player once told me that quitting is the most important skill that a poker player can develop. The more I came to understand the life of poker, the more I realized how right he was. Almost all poker players quit too little when they're down, and too much when they're up. It is imperative that you treat quitting as a skill, and practice it mindfully. Don't *ever* be afraid to quit when you're down.

Yes, sometimes you're ahead in EV, you believe you have an edge, this player is worse than you. We've all heard such claims a thousand times before, from others and from ourselves. They are irrelevant. The best players in the world are not afraid to quit players who they think are worse than them. The skill of quitting, in fact, is *not* in quitting people who you think are better than you. Think about it&mdash;we almost always quit once we *truly believe* that we are the worse player.

The skill in quitting comes in quitting *before* you believe that you're worse. Because in every losing match you'll ever play, it will always take a certain amount of time before you reach that point of realization. Quit early. Never kick yourself for quitting (unless you're up).

It is even okay to quit fish sometimes. Some of the players I respect most have been known to quit fish. After all, 10% of the time, the people who you think are fish are not fish at all. And 1% of the time, even if they are fish, their strategies may be exploiting you, until you realize that your assumptions about their play or psychology are mistaken. This scenario is not as uncommon as you think.

As poker players, we are constantly judging our opponents. It's in our blood; it's how we differentiate the skill levels of players and how we dissect their psychology. But this instinct works against us when it comes to quitting. When we see that the structure of someone's game is incongruous or shoddily put together, we are quick to lump them into the category of &ldquo;fish.&rdquo; And, of course, if someone is a fish, then we decide we cannot quit them no matter what.

One of the best pieces of advice I've ever received as a poker player was this one: only play when you're having fun. Doesn't matter if he's a fish, doesn't matter if you're supposed to play a session today, or if you think you have to keep playing this guy&mdash;if you're not having fun, quit. No matter your structure or how many hands you want to put in, never mentally penalize yourself for a good quit.

Poker should be played. *Play*-ed! We use the word so easily that we sap it of its native meaning, but *play* should mean what it sounds like. Poker should be fun! Not only because it makes it easier, but because it makes us perform better. Being at play, *enjoying* when you're playing not only maximizes your sensitivity to learning (as we'll discuss later), but also makes you more creative, free-flowing, ready to experiment.

Poker is a game, in the end. Even if it is your passion, even if it is your livelihood, always remember that poker is a game. That is not to say that you shouldn't take it seriously&mdash;of course, you should. But if you are not enjoying it, then you should walk away until you can find a way to enjoy it again.

## Outlasting the Mountain

Although poker can often feel like a race, it's not. It is, rather, a feat of endurance. It is more about lasting than it is about being the swiftest. So make sure you last. Take your time. Build up slowly, check your footing at every step, and treat the mountain with respect.

Be sure to take days off. Play almost everyday, but not everyday. Take at least one day a week off. Don't be afraid to take days off on important life events, or days when you're simply not up to it (and never play when you're feeling mentally unwell). Having periods of rest, giving your brain time to recuperate from the stress and mental taxation is important, not only to prevent burnout and keep your brain healthy, but to allay some of the negative effects of stress, as well as consolidate learning. In any kind of training, you must engage in *cycles* of intense performance, followed by rest. Not giving your brain rest is just as bad as working out 7 days a week&mdash;you must allow your body and mind some time to rest and recover.

Take longer breaks as needed. If things are going really poorly, you're very unmotivated about poker, or if you're going on a trip of some sort, don't be afraid to take a week or two off once in a while. These sojourns can actually be very good for resetting your perspective as a poker player, and letting you come back to your game with fresh eyes and an open mind. They can also help to reintegrate your self-narrative after a painful downswing. Just be careful to always set a date when you start playing again, so that you don't stay away from the game too long, or start dreading your return. However, if you are somebody who *continually* takes breaks (or has wider motivational problems), this is a more insidious problem to tackle. In that case, I would advise perhaps living with other poker players if you already don't (the grinding energy tends to be infectious), or working with a mental coach.

Don't spend money. Don't withdraw. Play, play, play, and be as frugal as you can while you're building up your bankroll. In the early stages of your career, your money is not yours yet. It's your bankroll, not your &ldquo;money.&rdquo; Decide on a set amount that you'll cash out every month&mdash;more than the minimum you need to live reasonably, but not too much more&mdash;and don't cash out any more than that, even if you have a big day. Decide when you'll change these monthly cashout limits (perhaps once you reach 2/4, or 3/6, or whatever). This will keep you motivated, and keep your life connected to your success, without making you anxious about poker being able to sustain your lifestyle, or having your lifestyle drain your bankroll.

Right now, as you are growing as a player, it's all about building your bankroll. Poker is the egg you're nurturing. Take care of it, polish it, keep it warm, and it will grow into a big, healthy, egg-laying chicken. But for now, it's just an egg, so keep your dick in your pants and keep things simple.

Lastly, always have a poker goal, something guiding your development. Goals are invaluable motivation. They will stoke the fire in your belly and keep you climbing. Make sure time-related goals are procedural rather than results-based. That is to say, don't make a goal like &ldquo;I want to be at 2/4 in 2 months&rdquo; or &ldquo;I want to make $10,000 in the next week.&rdquo; Any goal related to time should be about *procedure* such as &ldquo;I want to play 7,000 hands this week,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I want to obey a 3 buyin stop loss everyday for the next 2 months.&rdquo;

It's okay (and very motivating) to have a results-based goal about eventually reaching certain stakes. But never tie that goal to a period of time. Let the goal come when it comes. And don't worry; there's nothing wrong with staring at 10/20 tables and daydreaming a little. If you ask me, that's part of the fun of poker too.

## Distress and Eustress

Stress is ubiquitous in poker. Being a professional poker player will age you; make no mistake of that. But the breadth and effects of stress you experience depend on how well you are able to manage that stress, and, particularly, how you manage your downswings.

We consider downswings to be bad because, obviously, they lose us money and are deeply unpleasant. But another important reason why downswings are bad for us is because they can contribute to **chronic stress**, and trigger your long-term stress response. Chronic stress is, simply put, long-term and consistent exposure to stressors. Evolutionarily, our stress responses were supposed to be short-lived and intermittent (and usually related to food acquisition or combat). It should be no surprise then that the continual and complex stresses that poker places on us are unnatural, and we are not built to withstand it for long stretches of time.

You've probably heard about the various bad things that stress can do to your body and brain, so I'm not going to go into too much detail about the physiology of it. But the important points are that chronic stress inhibits neuronal growth, causes depressed energy levels and mental functioning, and can negatively affect your immune system&mdash;on the whole, it is very detrimental to health and mental clarity. Clearly, we want to avoid chronic stress.

But how can we? Downswings are inevitable, aren't they? Perhaps this is simply our Faustian bargain&mdash;that in exchange for the lucre of poker, we must cede our mental well-being.

It is true that with a game like poker, it is impossible to avoid stress completely. If you are being constantly challenged, molded, and affected you will undergo stress. But it turns out, not all stress is equal. There are different neurochemical pathways activated by the stress that results from *work*, and the stress that results from *play*. This latter form of stress is sometimes termed **eustress** (as opposed to distress), and is analogous to the kind of stress your body undergoes during vigorous exercise, strength training, intellectual stimulation, or sexual activity&mdash;all of which are demonstrably *good* stressors for the body.

The idea, then, is that we must transform the stress of poker from distress into eustress. If we can manage this, we can subvert many of the negative effects of stress and maintain our mental well-being. The idea of *play*, as I stressed earlier, is paramount. When you play poker, you must be *playing*!

Make poker fun, engaging, interesting, and self-interested. Whenever it is not, step away from it. Poker should motivate you. It should be fun, and satisfying! Poker should never feel like a grind, but rather like a journey, an adventure, a quest.

## How to be Happy for People

It is a statistical certainty that every single day, some fish somewhere will win a tournament. Sitting in his mother's basement, clicking buttons and playing his lucky cards, he binks more in one sitting than you make in an entire month&mdash;or an entire year.

How does that make you feel?

Perhaps this doesn't bother you. If you've played poker for a while, it probably shouldn't. So imagine instead one of the regulars at your stakes. Not the good one&mdash;no, he might almost deserve it. Think of the fishiest, scummiest, trash-talkiest nitreg you know. The guy you always want to pound on at the tables. And then imagine him binking a massive tournament for $400,000. You wake up one morning to find him at the top of the tournament leaderboards. He's donking around at $10/$20 PLO, laughing in chat and sending free money to the rail.

How about that? Steaming yet?

Or worse yet, imagine your poker nemesis. You know the one. Maybe he's the guy who rose up the stakes alongside you, always talks trash, is infuriatingly good and always knows when you're bluffing&mdash;maybe you've never spoken to him, but in your mind you two are eternal competitors. Or perhaps, your closest friend, the one with whom you have competed side-by-side, the one who sets all of the milestones by which you measure your progress&mdash;what if it's *him* who binks that big tournament? What if he gets catapulted to high stakes, leaving you behind to grind out your .5/1 or 2/4 by yourself?

If there's one inevitability in this poker, it's that things will be unfair. Great players will sometimes fail, and bad players will sometimes succeed. This is an inevitability. But how can we *embrace* this fact? Intellectually, it becomes easy to accept after a while. But the challenge is in accepting it with *grace*&mdash;and eventually, with happiness for other people's fortune.

We naturally have two emotional responses to other people's success&mdash;envy and self-consciousness. Envy, because we want what they have. When they gain respect, fortune, or fame because we already desire those things for ourselves, we naturally resent them. But they also make us feel self-conscious, because their fortune separates them from us. Once your nemesis becomes rolled for high stakes, he is no longer a member of your caste. He has risen above you. It leaves you wondering&mdash;why not you? Were you not as good as him? Not as smart? Not as deserving? In the end, this reaction has more to do with negativity toward ourselves than toward others.

But the one thing we all have in common is our desire to be free from these emotions. No one *wants* to feel bad when others succeed. We want to be indifferent, or happy for them. But how do we get there?

Survey yourself. When someone else succeeds and you feel negatively towards it, where does that negativity come from? Analyze your emotions as clearly as you can. Then find and espouse a mental frame that diminishes that response.

For example, here is a very powerful mental frame: &ldquo;I am climbing my own mountain of poker. My challenge is dealing with what happens to me; what happens to anyone else is irrelevant.&rdquo; If you'll remember, this is similar to the fog of variance frame discussed in an earlier chapter. It reinforces the idea that other people's fortune is independent from your own. You must imagine your mountain is already set in stone, as are others'&mdash;but that needn't bother you, anymore than it should bother you that someone else at a table was dealt AA. People will get dealt AA. You know they will. But all you can do is focus on playing whatever you were dealt as well as you can.

Try being happy for people. Even people you don't like. It's hard, and we are inundated with stories of other people succeeding, while poker constantly tries to convince us: &ldquo;why not you?&rdquo; But you suspect&mdash;rightfully so&mdash;that your life as a poker player will be better when you can be genuinely happy for others. This point extends to bad beats, too.

Stop telling bad beat stories. The desire to complain to others about your bad beats derives from a nearby artery&mdash;wanting affirmation that your failures are not your fault, and that you deserve more than what you have. Sharing bad beat stories makes you pay inordinate attention to hands where you lose unjustly. Just by repeatedly re-living those spots, you reinforce negativity, and the belief that all of your losses are unjust.

Make a rule for yourself that you're no longer allowed to tell bad beat stories, but instead, are only allowed to show other people hands where *you* suck out. Remind yourself of how fortunate you are. Reinforce the belief&mdash;I am lucky to get the breaks I *do* get. Things could always be worse. This will not only make you a more positive and better poker player (and improve your well-being outside of poker), but focusing on your good fortune is bound to make you a better person on the whole.

Practice being happy for others. Tell a friend good job on his winning month. Write someone who won a tournament a private message, applauding him. Maybe, if you want a challenge, write that regular you dislike, the one who outstripped you and is now a higher stakes player, and congratulate him on a success. Do little things. Make sure they hurt a little, kick up your bitterness, or make you a little sick to your stomach. Lean into your envy. This is the only way to extinguish it.

Eventually, it won't bother you anymore. You'll learn to be more relaxed about other people, and with yourself. You will find great relief in being happy for others.

We concluded the first part of this article series with a discussion on structuring your poker life and career. But being a poker player is about more than merely playing poker&mdash;it is also in how you conduct your life around it.

It is no secret that poker is an unwieldy horse. It is stubborn, unpredictable, and will happily buck anyone who can't hold on. Most can't. You likely know someone who couldn't, and was trampled underneath the weight of poker.

I know many.

I want you to hold on. But it isn't easy. It requires attentiveness, hard work, and living well. It requires honoring your life and your health. In part two of this article series, we will discuss the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle as a poker player, including practical advice on sleep, nutrition, and exercise. We will then go on to discuss motivation, and the role that need and ego play in the development of a poker player.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MfQxYZvfYxQ">[video]</div>

## A Healthy Constitution

Poker is a demanding existence. It drains us. It muddies our sleep, health, and diet. Many poker players have trouble balancing their lives; some never do. One of the greatest challenges to you as a poker player is to restore that balance. Not only for the sake of your game, but for the sake of your overall well-being.

The bedrock of your constitution comes from diet and nutrition. Even if the other pieces are missing&mdash;if you're sleeping poorly or not exercising&mdash;learning healthy eating habits is perhaps the most valuable thing you can do to immediately improve your well-being.

Stop eating processed foods. Throw them out completely. Cut out as much sugar as you can. Ideally, limit your diet to fruits, vegetables, nuts, meat, and unrefined grains (if you're ambitious, you may want to try cutting out grains entirely). Eat multiple meals a day&mdash;4 or 5 is ideal, but if you're not already, at least 3 meals a day is a good start. Eat to satiety, not fullness. When shopping, stay on the periphery of the supermarket&mdash;almost everything in the aisles is processed, or otherwise bad for you. Eat real food, as close to fresh and from the farm as you can. Take a multivitamin and fish oil to supplement any nutritional deficiencies. Eat slowly. Savor your food. Be consistent in your meals. Cook if you can, or hire a personal chef if you can afford it. Pre-made meals are also a reasonable option. Don't eat fast food, even when you're feeling lazy. Be consistent, push through for a while, and you'll build up habits that will sustain you.

Cut out sodas and soft-drinks completely&mdash;they are essentially liquid candy. Energy drinks are especially sugary and come loaded with dangerous amounts of caffeine, so avoid them. Caffeine itself is a tolerable vice, so if you must have caffeine, ingest it from tea or coffee (Google &ldquo;bulletproof coffee&rdquo; for a healthy and delicious coffee recipe). Drink as little alcohol as possible (and always lock yourself out of your poker accounts when you plan to drink). If you must consume alcohol, give preference to wine (especially red), light beers, and wood-aged spirits (whiskey, brandy, scotch, cognac).

Eating multiple, smaller meals a day, consisting of foods that have lower glycemic loads (that is, foods that don't have as much sugar and don't spike your insulin levels as strongly) will make your blood sugar more consistent throughout the day. More consistency means that you won't have the ups and downs of sluggishness and depression that often comes from a poor diet. You will feel more rounded and energetic throughout the day.

## The Power of Exercise

In a lifestyle as sedentary and chaotic as poker, regular exercise can feel like it's difficult to maintain. But the benefits of exercise are numerous and powerful&mdash;it's truly one of the most valuable investments you can make in your life.

Regular vigorous exercise triggers rushes of endorphins (which not only make us feel good, but also increase our mental clarity and stimulate learning). It also helps to keep our energy levels stable throughout the day. It's been proven time and time again that exercise is the *most effective* treatment for depression (individually more effective than either antidepressants or therapy), and this has a dose response, meaning the more exercise you do, the more improvement to your overall affect. Plus, this is not to mention that it dramatically increases your life span, your immune system, makes you look better, burns fat, and allows you to eat more (who doesn't love eating?). Exercise is as close to a panacea as it gets.

If you're not exercising at all, start. Find something easy and doable. It may be something like powerwalking, a small regimen of pushups and situps, jogging, even some mild yoga. For poker players who travel often, it is important to remember that you can get in very intense body-weight workouts *anywhere*. There are no excuses. When I was traveling through Europe, I would often do my workouts in a hotel room, out in a park, or on a secluded street corner.

A word of advice: don't just get a gym membership and think you've got it taken care of. Statistically, paying for a gym membership in and of itself doesn't make it very likely you'll actually go consistently, or get in good workouts. Instead, sign up for exercise classes, hire a personal trainer, or find a motivated workout buddy to train with you. The latter three, because they involve *structure* and *social pressure*, make it much more likely that you will end up exercising and being consistent with your workouts. They will also make your average workout intensity much higher.

It may help to emphasize skill development rather than just &ldquo;working out.&rdquo; Focus on building strength, or improving your yoga/flexibility, or improving your kickboxing skills. The more motivating and goal-oriented you are, the easier it will be to exercise continually. It goes back to as we discussed in an earlier chapter&mdash;co-opt your environment. Assume your unconscious self will generally take the path of least resistance, so stack the odds in favor of exercising. It will pay off in the end.

And lastly, don't fear overtraining. The odds of overtraining for someone who's just beginning or has an intermediate workout regimen is so low as to be negligible. Workout as much and often as you possibly can&mdash;it will hurt at first, and be cumbersome. But eventually, you will mentally associate it with the feeling of efficacy and the proceeding endorphin rush that comes after a good workout. Eventually, you'll start to like it (I promise). It takes time to get over the initial hump, but the fruits of good exercise are invaluable for your body and mind.

## Sleep and Sleep Cycles

Finally, we come to sleep. Sleep is one of the most notoriously chaotic elements in a poker player's life. The poker player who goes to bed at sunrise and wakes up at 3PM has become almost a cliché. But sleep is essential to not only physical recovery and health, but it is *vital* to the consolidation of learning and memories. Sleep is when your brain is reorganizing itself, processing everything it's learned from the previous day, and replenishing its energy stores. Getting good and adequate sleep, therefore, is essential to learning poker.

Studies show that aligning with your natural Circadian rhythms (being awake during times of light and sleeping during dark) minimizes fatigue. Your body has been acclimated over hundreds of thousands of years to be awake during the day and asleep at night, so inverting that rhythm is suboptimal for your mental and physical functioning. For some, inverted sleep may be unavoidable, especially those who play live poker.

But for the rest of us who have more freedom over where and when we can play, we should try to adjust our sleep to be awake during the day and asleep at night. Being aligned with the cycle of sunlight will increase your energy levels, your overall health, and perhaps just as importantly, will keep you more connected to the rest of the waking world. Being a citizen of the night is very isolating, and is probably one of the reasons why depression is so rampant among poker players. An inverted sleep cycle disconnects you from the rest of the world.

Be wary of your **sleep hygiene**. Sleep hygiene is the term psychologists use to describe healthy, consistent sleeping habits. The basis of good sleep hygiene is going to sleep at the same time every night, and making sure you get continuous 7-9 hours of sleep every night. In fact, studies show that the most important element of sleep hygiene is sleeping *at a consistent time*. Inconsistent sleep is far worse for your body and mental functioning than inverted sleep. So treat your sleep as sacred, and take extra lengths to try to sleep at the same time (or close to it) every day.

Other important elements of sleep hygiene are simple recommendations: don't eat heavy meals before sleeping, avoid any stimulants such as caffeine or nicotine, and avoid alcohol. Don't do anything in your bed except sleep and have sex&mdash;no reading, laptop use, or TV watching. Associate your bed solely with sleep, and it will become easier for you to fall asleep.

A good way to structure good sleep habits is by having a pre-sleep ritual. Brushing your teeth, changing into pajamas, reading before bed, or whatever you do&mdash;having pre-established rituals that signal your body and mind to get ready for sleep will ease the nighttime transition, and relax you so that falling asleep becomes easier.

But as poker players, our sleep hygiene is constantly assailed by the vagaries of poker. Most commonly, sleep patterns tend to be disrupted by big downswing days, or after marathon sessions. It is vital that you don't allow this to happen. Letting bad poker days affect your sleep will only magnify the loss' effects, and make it that much harder to mentally and emotionally recover the next day. If it is time to sleep and you have just quit a losing session, or are still stewing over one, you must first find a way to relax yourself. If the loss still stings, practice some relaxation techniques, take a warm bath, call a friend, watch funny Youtube clips&mdash;whatever will calm you down so that you can sleep properly. Writing about the session immediately afterward may help to divest you of the feelings and thoughts you're experiencing, so you can leave them behind when you go to sleep.

Remember, when you get up from a bad session, you have not absolved yourself of responsibility. A challenge still remains from the moment you leave the table&mdash;the challenge of resuming your normal day-to-day habits with minimal disruption. If you want to live well as a poker player, you must strive to live well *in spite* of poker. Being able to get a good night's sleep after a bad day, eat a good breakfast in the morning and have a vigorous workout is in and of itself a victory. Your normal routine in and of itself will abate much of the negativity that usually settles after a bad downswing. Think of your lifestyle as your frame&mdash;the frame of &ldquo;despite this, my life moves forward.&rdquo; Fight for that frame. Your lifestyle is the vehicle which will carry you forward.

If it needs fixing, fix it now. Move your sleep slowly toward nighttime. Start cutting out bad foods, little by little. Go on a jog, or sign up for a jiu jitsu class. Fortify yourself step-by-step, and always feel like you're moving forward. Take care to nourish your body and mind, and they will excel and be of great use to you.

## Need and Ego

It always struck me as a curiosity that the vast majority of world-class poker players came from the same place&mdash;they are almost all mostly young, college-educated Western males from comfortable middle-class backgrounds. Of course, you can attribute a lot of this to cultural factors. College is where middle-class, analytically-minded boys have a lot of free time (and poker is marketed primarily towards males), so that explains some of it. But it doesn't explain this: why don't more great players come out of poverty? Why aren't global poker sites inundated with grinders from China, or India, or other parts of the developing world where people *really need* the money? To be a bit cynical, it seems all of the money in poker mostly goes to the people who don't really need it.

What is it that these Western kids are playing for, then? It's hard to encapsulate it in a word. Perhaps ego. Competition. Validation. Fighting for a dream, or a fantasy. Although you might say that such motivations are minor, somehow they seem to be stronger and more sustaining motivations than need.

In fact, studies in behavioral economics have demonstrated the adverse effects of monetary motivation on creative performance. To put it simply, the more you have physically at stake, the further creative performance plummets. But once you find intrinsic motivations&mdash;e.g., ego, competition, self-mastery&mdash;your performance at a creative task becomes more steady and robust.

Comparing poker to a video game is a common trope, but it may have a great deal of insight to it. Imagine if you had to play a video game, but every time you lost a life, you lost money. Do you think you'd play better or worse? The pressure would most likely not only make you play worse, but stress you out and lessen your enjoyment of the game. Poker is very much the same way. Those who feel that poker is a safe haven, a playground, an arcade game on their computer&mdash;they are most free to be creative, to explore, to *play*. They are able to learn and experiment uninhibitedly. And, as is common knowledge now, intrinsic motivations tend to be stronger and more sustaining than extrinsic ones. It is more powerful to want to attain mastery at something, or to prove something to yourself, than to want to reach an arbitrary monetary amount or achieve some kind of external goalpost.

This, again, bespeaks the importance of having the right kind of motivation. Embrace a goal of self-mastery, or becoming better than your competition. Don't play because you need to. Play because you *want* to.

## The Obsession

Most poker player's relationship with the game begins out of obsession. If you have never spent hours tinkering with excel sheets, PokerStove, your HEM stats, railing the $25/$50 games immersed in a personal fantasy, then you will probably never be a great player. Every great player I have ever known has started with this obsession.

The obsession is not always a healthy one. It usually isn't. For many, it digs into them, and handful at a time, scoops out the pulp of their life. Before long, through fantasies, through reading forums and poker books, through breakfasts contemplating how to balance their turn overbetting ranges, poker possesses them. It enters them like a ghost, a parasite. And it rallies every resource they have toward poker.

No one else will tell you this, but I will tell you the truth: if you do not have this&mdash;if you have never been taken over, if this mania has not hijacked your mind&mdash;then you should give up on poker. You should walk away now. You will never be a great player. Chances are, you will only lose money and time. You are liable to only hurt yourself and those around you.

This is the truth. If you are not a little bit crazy, you will never reach the level of excellence and dedication required to master poker.

But let's say you do. Let's say you wake up in the middle of the night from dreams of hands you you'd played the day before. Let's say you fantasize, calculate, strategize, obsess. Then perhaps poker is for you. Perhaps that fire will propel you. Dive into further into its depths. Once you do, poker itself will be the easy part. Even when it's not easy, it will be easy.

That is where the real work begins&mdash;in taming the obsession. When you are developing as a player, poker is constantly pumping through your veins, like a drug, a poison. But after a while, perhaps years, or however long it takes you to reach a place of maturity, or security&mdash;after that, you must be ready to retake control of your life. For most poker players, it takes them a long time to take back the reins. Some never do at all.

This retaking is essential. It is the basis upon which we as professional poker players can find peace, happiness, flourishing. There comes a point in the life of every burgeoning professional at which you must steal back your life and make it your own. Perhaps you are at that point now.

In the next article, we will conclude our examination of the life of a poker player. We will look into the importance of spiritual health, happiness, balance in life, and resolving your identity as a poker player. These three articles will comprise the final chapter in my book, and so the next article will also be the final one.

In the first two parts of this article, I gave much advice on structuring your poker career, and the proper roles of health, ego, and obsession. But what I have not yet discussed are the spiritual and philosophical aspects of life as a poker player.

How should we live our lives *away* from poker? What relationship should we have with the game? How can we become happy, and still be poker players?

I cannot promise that what I have to say will fully answer these questions for you. Only time and repeated failures will provide you with those answers. But I can promise that what I have to say will stimulate your thoughts, and hopefully, spur you toward finding your own answers.

Let us move forward, from the health of the body to the health of the mind.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QpFjuC7JrAo">[video]</div>

## Spiritual Health

The basis of a good life is balance. Not just balance in physical health, but in mental and spiritual as well.

Do not neglect your spiritual needs. And by spiritual needs, I don't mean religious needs&mdash;though if you are religious, then religion can be a powerful source of spiritual nourishment. But for those who are not religious, there are still many paths to spiritual health.

Meditation has been practiced in various forms for thousands of years. Studies show that regular meditation has profound effects on the brain. It can increase pain tolerance, improve resilience to stressors, and is correlated with an increased sense of well-being. There are many different types of meditation that you can incorporate into your life&mdash;zazen, vipassana, qigong, mindfulness, to name only a few. If you've never meditated before, the [UCLA Mindful Awareness Research Center is a good place to start](http://marc.ucla.edu/body.cfm?id=22).

But, if you are a poker player, meditation alone is unlikely to sustain you. As poker players, we are deeply engaged in the world, and so detachment alone cannot solve all of our problems. We must face the world and our desires head on. Thus, the greater part of our spiritual fulfillment must derive from our **self-actualization**. Basically, self-actualization comes from aligning the *self-we-are* with the *self-we-want-to-be*.

The ancient Greek poet Pindar once wrote, &ldquo;Be what you know you are.&rdquo; This is, to my mind, the best encapsulation of self-actualization. Decide what kind of person you want to be, and then move, thoughtfully and actively, toward that ideal self. When humans are aligned with this trajectory, they experience a sense of well-being. Self-actualization makes you feel like you're on the right path. It becomes easy to love yourself, and to honor the process of your life. When humans are misaligned with this trajectory, they often feel lost, as though they are squandering their lives. As a poker player, you have the freedom to pursue self-actualization in a way that most human beings on this planet don't.

Think about the kind of person you want to be. Not just in poker, but in all things. Visualize that person. Write what you see. Fix it in your mind. What is that person like? What do they do? How do they see themselves?

In whatever way you are unlike that person, in whatever way your ideal self outshines you, move toward it. If you are too pessimistic, try to be more optimistic. If your ideal self can do something you can't, start learning that skill. If your ideal self is in better shape, or is better-read, or knows another language&mdash;follow it! Become! Inch toward who you really want to be, and don't let a week go by in which you don't make any progress.

Learn new things. Improve your abilities. Become stronger, kinder, wiser. These are nourishment for the spirit. And it is your spirit, above all else, that will sustain you in poker.

## The Journey of Poker

A poker player must be a realist.

In the past, we've discussed with great optimism the importance of diligence, being healthy, and taking poker seriously. But it would be delusional to claim that following these precepts means you will necessarily succeed. While it is essential that any poker player become a rigorous student of the game, the fact remains that these things alone, no matter how thorough, are not a golden ticket.

Poker makes no promises.

Perhaps you will not be smart enough. Mentally tough enough. Maybe you won't have enough time, or energy, or money to brave the torrents of variance that poker will unleash on you. Perhaps&mdash;dare I say it&mdash;you will simply get unlucky. Poker is ultimately a gamble from start to finish. We don't get to choose our success. We can supplicate, make libations, practice prudence, but in the end it is the poker gods who choose whether we will prosper.

Part of the journey of poker is its uncertainty. We must live with that. But at the same time, we must take full responsibility for who we are and our success as poker players. There is no excuse not to take up every arm we can, not to scour for every shortcut, not to attempt every unexpected checkraise and slow-play that crosses our path. Though we are at the mercy of the poker gods, we must nevertheless struggle, push uphill, and keep our heads up. This uncertainty is also what it means to be a poker player. It is the journey we all have chosen.

The great imperative, as Nietzsche put it, is to love your fate&mdash;*amor fati*. Choose every moment that comes upon you as if you had invented it yourself. Embrace every failure, every success, every downswing and upswing, every hero call and failed read as your own. That's not to say that they are all your fault&mdash;but you must take them all as unquestionably yours. Don't seek justice. There is no such thing in poker. There is only fate&mdash;so you must seek your fate.

Accept everything that comes. This is the only philosophy that survives in poker. Usher in your fate with open arms. If you must suffer, suffer gladly, hoist it up like a flag. Love whatever happens. It is all a part of your journey.

To paraphrase Bruce Lee&mdash;do not hope for an easy life. Rather, hope for the strength to endure a difficult one.

## The Importance of Being Happy

In American culture, we are fond of telling people to &ldquo;find happiness.&rdquo; The phraseology suggests that this is a relatively straightforward task. Supposedly, there exists a thing somewhere called happiness, and we just need to find it. It may take a lot of looking around, we may have to fulfill certain obligations first, collect a certain amount of money, or join a certain social class&mdash;but once we jump through those hoops, it will be there, waiting for us.

Unfortunately, happiness is not just hard to find; it is impossible to find. Happiness is not found, but rather *constituted*. Let me explain what I mean.

There is a well-known factoid that 90% of lottery jackpot winners lose their fortune within 5 years or less. Much of this can be attributed to the fact that lottery winners, like the rest of us, are stupid. But there is a less well-known factotags: [in longitudinal studies of happiness, people who won the lottery had no sustained changes in their happiness level after one year. That is to say, their elevated levels of happiness and life satisfaction from winning the lottery very soon dropped completely back to normal.

Perhaps you find this surprising, perhaps you don't. But the opposite effect is even more surprising. Happiness studies of people who become significantly physically disabled, the same effect can be found&mdash;happiness levels drop, but return to normal within about a year. People permanently confined to wheelchairs, after a year, are just about as happy as they were before being disabled.

This seems perverse to us. It seems to brush off some of the most basic human metanarratives we have&mdash;the idea that if we work hard, our lives will be better, and if our lives are better, we'll be happier.

Time and time again, the evidence insists: happiness cannot be found.

Much of these effects can be attributed to what psychologists call **habituation**. Habituation is the psychological process by which we adapt to a constant stimulus by filtering it out. An obvious example of habituation is wearing clothes&mdash;as soon as you put your pants on in the morning, you feel them on your body, how they fit, their texture and warmth. But right now, as you examine yourself, you likely have no awareness of your clothes at all. It's almost as though your body has incorporated your clothes as part of you, and stopped registering them as foreign. The stimuli are being filtered out.

Habituation is essential for any complex organism. If we did not habituate, then we would constantly be overloaded with sensory information, so much so that it would impair our ability to direct our attention strategically. From an evolutionary perspective, things that are important tend to move (people, predators, prey). Thus, we evolved to filter out things that are stable and unchanging.

Incidents like winning a large amount of money, or being permanently confined in a wheelchair&mdash;these are all situations that, once they occur, are unchanging. Once you have a lot of money, you just have a lot of money. Once you're in a wheelchair, you're just in a wheelchair. Your brain starts filtering it out. It becomes the normal, and your brain doesn't pay attention to the normal (it's too busy worrying if a saber-toothed tiger is going to jump out of that rustling bush).

Although it runs counter to many of the narratives we've been taught, neither having a lot of money nor becoming physically disabled has a significant effect on happiness. So what does? The most inclusive answer would be: your disposition.

This is what I mean when I say that happiness is constituted. We do not *find* happiness, but we create it out of the ingredients of our lives *as they are*. People who are happy tend to be happy because of their disposition to see the world and themselves that way. Likewise for people who are unhappy. Our happiness levels tend to be fairly resilient&mdash;they usually stay around the same level for most people's lives.

But there are a few things we *can* say about how to be happy. Happiness studies reveal a few unsurprising results&mdash;couples are happier than single people, religion makes people happier, and optimists are happier than pessimists. People of means tend to be happier than poor people, but studies show rather robustly that income above $75,000 has no effect on happiness levels. That is, income has a moderate correlation with happiness until 75K, at which point the money really stops making a difference (perhaps because past that point, anxiety about money becomes trivial).

Experiences tend to make us more happy than material goods, and so you should aim to spend your money on experiences, rather than stuff. This is in no small part because it is very easy to habituate to material objects, but new experiences are, by their nature, impervious to habituation.

We can extend this insight to other aspects of our lives. How do we become more happy? One answer is to try to resist habituating to the good parts of life. Find ways to continually remind yourself of how fortunate you are, or how good you have it, or how awesome it was that you accomplished a goal. Savor and mentally relive your good experiences. Some psychologists suggest that you write a gratitude journal every morning, naming 5 different things that you're grateful for. Another strategy is to go without something you like for a while, and then reintroduce it. To some extent, we *can* learn how to be more optimistic and appreciative of the world around us.

Studies also show that being happy bolsters our ability to perform. The science of learning demonstrates that people learn and retain new information best when they are feeling good, and creative performance significantly improves while experiencing positive affect (contrary to the idea of the &ldquo;tortured artist&rdquo;). It increases your life span, your resilience, it makes you more likeable. One is almost inclined to say that being happy will keep you happy.

And yet, the question of how to *become* happy remains a tricky question. Many cultures have offered their own answers to this question, and there is no answer that will fit everyone. But for my own part, on the question of happiness I look to the transcendentalists. To them, the question &ldquo;how do I become happy?&rdquo; is in itself the wrong one to ask. Rather, one should lead a good life, better oneself continually, and be good to others. Happiness, to my mind, not the *purpose* of a good life, but rather, one of its consequences.

In the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson: &ldquo;The purpose of life is not to be happy. It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some difference that you have lived and lived well.&rdquo;

I try to live by those words. But if they do not suffice for you, don't worry; you are not alone. It simply means you must keep on searching.

## Staring out the Window

In the end, if you are to be a professional poker player, then poker will be the chief focus of your waking life. Things will be that way for a while. But you must not derive your sense of self from poker. You must remember that you are more than your poker playing self.

I stress this, in no small part, because I failed at this when I was a poker player. And I believe now that this was largely what made me unhappy throughout my career. After enough time, I could not sever my larger identity from my identity as a poker player. I forgot who I was&mdash;I lost myself to the game.

Do not lose yourself. You are *you*. Explore every side of yourself. Even while you are studying poker and invested in this journey, you must not forget who you are, and what you are worth in the absence of poker. Find balance.

And when I say find balance, I mean&mdash;integrate yourself in the world! Keep in touch with your friends outside of poker. Always be learning new skills, reading and learning about the world, making new friends and challenging your sense of reality. We all start being consumed by poker, but you must not remain consumed by it.

You will not play poker forever; none of us will. So don't bury all of your seeds in this plot. Once you have a sizeable bankroll, I would advise you to cash out half of your bankroll and invest it, then treat it as though it's off-limits. Have a backup plan in case things go wrong (either on your end, or by some catastrophic incident). Have some sense of what you are going to do after your poker career is over. Think about it seriously. It's an important question. Even if you love poker, to be a consummate professional, you must be thoughtful about all of the possibilities.

Please, don't be cynical about poker. It's easy to be. It's easy to say that poker is a useless game, to treat it with contempt, to see it as a mere money-making machine. Poker can be those things, of course. It can be whatever you want it to be.

But don't do yourself that injustice. It's a waste. Poker, if you treat it with respect, can be a rite of passage for the rest of your life. It can be an arena for practicing self-mastery. Poker can teach you patience, fortitude, thoughtfulness, strength. It doesn't have to be meaningless. It shouldn't be! Let poker challenge you, let it raise you up. Let it make of you a greater human being than you were when you came to it. It can do all of those things if you treat this game, and yourself, with dignity.

Be careful. Don't let poker make you jaded or negative. Don't let yourself lose connection with the rest of the world. Don't forget the poor, the unlucky, the self-sacrificing. Don't forget art. Don't forget books. Don't forget working with your hands. Don't forget helping people. Don't forget sunrises, or mountains, or taking walks on winter mornings. Please, remain connected to the world. Poker may be around for a long time, but you won't. Don't let your time slip away.

One last thing. If you ever find yourself, on a lazy Sunday afternoon, staring out the window at a tree, at a bird, at the blue sky… whatever you do, don't think about poker.

I wish you the best of luck. I mean it. I really do.

It's fall now, and just starting to get cold in Texas. I haven't written in a while.

The book, The Philosophy of Poker, I will collate and edit from the pieces written on this blog. I'll release it within the next couple of months as an e-book. There will be extensive editing, some additional material I've thought of in the interim while writing the book, and some revisions of ideas that I've changed my mind about. On the whole, if you want to have all of the work in one easy-to-read format, or something you can read on an e-book reader, you will be pleased with the final result. If there is enough demand, I may consider doing audio recordings of the chapters.

But that's all forthcoming. What about now? What comes next?

> The truth will set you free. But not until it is finished with you.

Those of you who follow me on my blog must have noticed an obvious trend in these blog entries. I have been pontificating about poker and psychology and whatnot. But I haven't talked about myself at all over the past year.

I've always been bad at that. I'm a better listener than a speaker. Perhaps that's one of the reasons that I fell into poker so naturally&mdash;poker is all about listening, observing, and deciphering the person in front of you. It is more about seeing than saying.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kFaypkwEXh4">[video]</div>

It should have been a tough year for me. From having [Jason Burt steal 90k from me and disappear](http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/showpost.php?p=38315814&postcount=1), to learning in the 11<sup>th</sup> hour, after FTP remissions began, that my former [Red Pro status barred me for receiving my locked up balance](http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/showpost.php?p=40184543&postcount=108), to other financial hiccups&mdash;I've run about as bad as a retired poker player can run.

But that's okay. It's hard to be mad. Anger doesn't come naturally to me. And ultimately, I'm okay. I'm not going to starve, and I have my health. I am grateful for that. Perhaps this is all deserved, and the way it should be&mdash;some kind of cosmic equalization. No doubt, I have a lot of bad karma to work off still.

It's been two years now. Two years, and still, the Girah affair is fresh in my mind. How stupid is that? Two whole years. Even now, I have dreams about it. I wake up feeling like I'm in the middle of it again. When I see stories about public scandals, my stomach retracts into a pit. I can't even read them without feeling sick. It's as though the guilt is lodged somewhere deep in my intestines, or branded into my DNA. Whenever I think about the scandal itself, about everything that I did, it just crushes me.

To tell you the truth, I've believed ever since then that I am a bad person. For two years now, since I returned to the States, I've been living as simply as I can and doing volunteer work almost every week&mdash;construction work with Habitat for Humanity, and now, teaching English to refugees for iACT. I've tried my best to be kind, to be selfless, to give myself away. Really, I've been desperate. For what, I don't know. Absolution? Salvation? Assurance that I am not wretched? I don't know what would be enough.

I get nods from strangers, smiles, little stories about how I've helped. I am told to come back next week, and the week after that. Things haven't changed.

What comes next? In spite of everything, life smears itself forward.

I'm not sure where I'm going next. I've given thought to many roads. Going to law school; pursuing a PhD; entering finance; going west and joining the world of entrepreneurs. I don't know yet for sure, but I'll likely know&mdash;or have to&mdash;after the next six months.

Right now, I have to focus on right now. I need to edit this book, focus on my work, keep looking forward. I have to trust the process. The answers to the questions&mdash;what comes next, and how to like it&mdash;I will have to do without for the moment.

I had been thinking some about the aesthetics of poker lately, and someone reminded me of an article I wrote in 2009, back when I was 19. I've decided to reprise it here with a little editing; it didn't need that much, to my surprise. It's one of the pieces I wrote about poker that I'm really proud of, so I wanted to have it here as well. I hope you guys enjoy it.

Pablo Picasso once said, &ldquo;Beauty?… To me it is a word without sense, because I do not know where its meaning comes from nor where it leads to.&rdquo; Beauty is a difficult word to define, and it seems to have no single definitive characteristic. There can be beauty in a flower, beauty in a waterfall, beauty in a woman. But there are other forms of beauty that are less basic to our perception. We can find beauty in the movement of dance, in the richness of music, the rhythm of poetry. And yet we can go further, to beauty that departs from these conventional senses of the word. We can find beauty in mathematical proofs, beauty in the handling of a basketball, beauty in a chess stratagem, and indeed, beauty in a hand of poker.

I have always been an artistically-minded person. Not because I am myself an artist, but because I have always been drawn toward art. So this question had a special resonance to me: in what sense can a hand of poker be beautiful?.

It certainly isn't beautiful in any purely aesthetic sense (that is, in its appeal to our senses). A hand of poker will never be sensually stimulating, and in that way, it is more like the beauty of a mathematical derivation than the beauty of a painting. In order to understand what makes a hand of poker beautiful, we must first decide how we ought to appropriate the concept. There must be some experience in common between observing a beautiful hand of poker and anything else that is beautiful. What is it like to experience a beautiful hand of poker?.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f19NA6bqiTA">[video]</div>#### Looking to the Source

To discover if beauty existed in poker, I looked to the source, poker players. I picked a few high stakes players I knew and interviewed them. I carefully chose players who I thought were particularly reflective and intelligent, and I tried to phrase my questions carefully so as to extract as much of their own thoughts as possible, without biasing them toward mine. Although I won't name the poker players I interviewed, they were very established high stakes regulars.

What I found was that there was a surprising unanimity among them on not only that there *was* beauty in poker, but also on what constituted that beauty. For all three players I interviewed, I began in the same way&mdash;&rdquo;can you name some hand or event in the context of poker that you would describe as beautiful?&rdquo; Each of them provided one hand that they felt fit this criterion. I then probed their reasoning about why they thought the particular hand was beautiful, and what made poker hands beautiful in general.

The first person told me, &ldquo;I think anytime I make a &ldquo;perfect bet,&rdquo; as in one with a certain timing or amount to make my opponent do exactly what I want, that's beautiful.&rdquo; The second person described a beautiful poker hand as &ldquo;manipulating [one's] opponents in an artistic way.&rdquo; The third person described beauty in poker as &ldquo;finding an eloquent, unexpected solution.&rdquo; The language was slightly different among the three players, but when I questioned them further, I found that they could be distilled to the same essential component&mdash;mastery.

Mastery is beautiful. It's making perfect bets, making your opponent do exactly what you want. It's manipulating your opponent in an artistic way. It's finding that eloquent, unexpected solution. Mastery is beautiful, and so we must explore what mastery is to explore what is beautiful within poker.

#### What is Mastery?

If you imagine the world from an undifferentiated, &ldquo;objective&rdquo; perspective, there is no such thing as mastery. This is true on various levels, such as saying &ldquo;everything is just particles mashing about chaotically&rdquo; or &ldquo;if an alien came to earth and watched humans playing a game of basketball, they would see nothing but animals romping around with a ball,&rdquo; and of course there are infinitely many variations on this theme. The notion of mastery collapses once you deconstruct some element of the cultural frame surrounding that task. Mastery does not exist objectively; it exists only once you set parameters on what experiences are meaningful, and what goals ought to be pursued by human endeavors.

The philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre aptly separates the human sphere thus: the widest sphere, the entire human community, recognizes a limited number of forms of mastery. These are mostly limited to the basic virtues: moral goodness, industriousness, courage, etc. It is only when we narrow our scope to looking within what he calls a &ldquo;practice,&rdquo; that the more variegated and interesting goals of human effort become meaningful (he calls these &ldquo;internal goods&rdquo;&mdash;goals that are meaningful within a certain practice, but not outside it). A practice is any subsection of humanity in which people are pursuing a more specific set of goals than those pursued by the larger human community. Practices can be simply understood as crafts or professions, like carpentry, or basketball, or cardplaying.

So in order to understand mastery in poker, we have to realize that outside of the practice of poker, there is no meaning or intrinsic value in the mastery of poker, and hence it could not possibly translate into beauty. One must first acknowledge poker as a worthwhile practice, and *understand* poker well enough to recognize mastery. If there is beauty in poker, it is entrenched behind these two layers, which the average person will not be able to cut through. In the same way, I may be told that a mathematical proof is beautiful, but even though I have some rudimentary understanding, and even reverence, of mathematics, I don't have anywhere near the understanding of the practice to recognize mastery, and hence beauty. Show me two potential proofs of the Poincaré conjecture, and setting aside which proof is beautiful and which isn't, I wouldn't even be able to tell which one were a proof and which were garbled nonsense.

So if there is beauty in poker, then this beauty can only exist within the practice, and can only be recognized among those who have sufficient understanding of the practice. You might even go so far as to say that within every practice that is sufficiently complex and understood, there exists some form of beauty (hence, it shouldn't puzzle you to hear a CEO talk about a beautiful negotiation, or a boxer talk about a beautiful punch, or even a scammer talk about a beautiful scam). So we should have no apprehensions with talking about beauty in poker so long as we understand how we are constraining the set of people who can experience this beauty.

So, that being said, what constitutes mastery? The dictionary will tell you that mastery is &ldquo;the possession of consummate skill.&rdquo; This is easy enough to understand, but it falls short of providing a useful picture. If you think about mastery in terms of poker, it seems as though mastery can be roughly defined as the ability to make the most +EV set of actions (given, of course, imperfect information). So to recognize mastery, we must be able to recognize what is the most +EV action to take at any point in time&mdash;we must know what &ldquo;the right play&rdquo; is. If you have no idea what the right play is while looking at all possible options, then you will not be able to perceive mastery, and hence the beauty of a hand will escape you.

Now, this definition actually gets a little tricky here, because defining mastery as simply &ldquo;making the right play,&rdquo; seems to be overly inclusive. For example, folding 39o preflop UTG in a full ring game is absolutely the right play each and every time. And yet, if we had the hole card cam on Phil Ivey folding 39o UTG, this would not strike us beautiful. The notion of mastery would not even enter our thoughts. We have to then infer that there are some things which are optimal (&ldquo;the right play&rdquo;), but which are not beautiful.

How is this line drawn? How are some things which are optimal beautiful, and others trivial? Our reaction is to look for the purely aesthetic element&mdash;e.g., in basketball, a dunk is more visually impressive than inbounding a ball, so that's why a great dunk will be more beautiful than a great inbound pass. But I don't think that this is enough. I think a better way to understand this problem is to think about the difference between structure and &ldquo;gameplay.&rdquo; (I choose the word *gameplay* because the analogies that I'm using here are games like chess, basketball, and poker, but this still applies to a practice which is not a game, such as mathematics or carpentry or whatever..

#### Structure and Gameplay

In all of human experience, there is a basic duality that defines our interaction with the world. That duality is the opposition between the conscious and the unconscious, foreground and background, substructure and superstructure. All of experience is predicated upon this fundamental, yet almost invisible distinction. In any experience of the external world, your unconscious filters out what is unimportant, otherwise it would be impossible for your brain to extract patterns from such enormous swathes of information (all of the visual, aural, and tactile stimulation that your nerves are recording at every moment of your life). If you are exposed to any stimulus long enough, it congeals into a background entity, swept behind the curtain of your consciousness, and ceases to be an object of direct perception. This is obvious with things like putting on pants or wearing sunglasses&mdash;at first, it is an object of experience, but as it the experience is repeated (the feeling of having your leg press against denim or seeing an object shaded darker than it usually is), your brain filters it out and you no longer notice it. In a way, this is what happens in games like poker as well.

This initially manifests in understanding the basic structure of the game. When two players get to showdown and turn up their cards, if you had no idea how poker was played, looking at their hands would be completely meaningless to you. You wouldn't know the structure of the game&mdash;you wouldn't know the rules. How would you decide who won? Of course, poker has a complicated set of rules about how to combine two cards together to create different hands, some of which beat others. This is the structure of the game on the simplest level. Once you understand how to evaluate showdowns, then this is subsumed into your understanding of the structure of the game. At that point, you understand the basic rules. You can't break those rules. You can't take the pot if you have a straight and your opponent has a flush; the structure of the game determines that the person who has the flush will win no matter what.

But the structure of the game goes further than that. The structure is simply what is constant to your perception&mdash;there's no reason why it has to be limited to the most explicit rules. Once you have learned basic preflop hand requirements, then you know that raising 39o UTG is definitely a bad play, so you fold it every time. In fact, everybody else folds 39o UTG as well. When you fold 39o UTG, you no longer have to mentally consult a preflop raising chart to see whether that falls into the range of hands you can play around with&mdash;it's simply an auto-fold. Folding 39o preflop becomes a mental constant, you stop perceiving it or thinking about it as a decision in your poker game. Folding 39o effectively becomes a rule of the game. You can't break this rule, in the same way that you can't take the pot if you have a straight against a flush. It is incorporated into the structure of the game.

![Gambling Addiction by schnappischnap, on Flickr](http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5342/8969117237_3ca6fa687e.jpg)

So structure becomes more and more developed as one moves closer to mastery of any practice. In poker, many things start to become relegated to structure, such as continuation betting, raising the river with the nuts, 3-betting AK preflop, etc. If anything is obviously the correct play and is constantly repeated, it eventually becomes incorporated into structure and ceases to be a point of gameplay. Gameplay, then, can be defined as that which is not constant&mdash;whatever we need to think about, what's dynamic in any instance of the game that we play. In a 10/20 6-max round, nobody is ever going to raise 39o UTG; that is simply not a part of gameplay, which is effectively the same as saying that it's an illegal move. However, 3-betting an UTG raiser with 67s *is* a legal move. People know that this is a viable play, but not a mandatory one. Hence, 3-betting an UTG raiser with 67s counts as gameplay.

The conclusion is that mastery will only be appreciated if it occurs within the *gameplay*, not within the *structure*. Anybody who follows the structure of a game has, in a sense, some basic level of mastery. Neither an amateur nor a professional basketball player will try to travel to the other side of the court without dribbling the basketball, and so both the amateur and professional are obeying the structure of the game, but we don't find this to be indicative of mastery. It simply means that if they don't do this, then they haven't outright broken the rules yet. True mastery is demonstrated through gameplay.

#### Delineating Structure

To properly separate structure from gameplay, you must first understand the structure that a master is working within. If an amateur were to watch a professional chess match, he might marvel at the thoughtfulness displayed in the first four or five opening moves. But for masters of chess, gameplay doesn't begin until their respective &ldquo;opening lines&rdquo; begin to interact. The first few opening moves are all structure, because they are determined by each player before the match began, or directly determined by the other player's opening. They're not dynamic.

Structure in high level poker is quite similar. When amateur poker players observe a high level match, very often what they tend to do is ascribe elements of gameplay to what is actually structure. When railbirds (or poor commentators) see a preflop 3-bet or a flop check/raise, they tend to say things like, &ldquo;Oh, he's fighting back!&rdquo; Or if they see somebody call a jam with a hand like 99, they might say something like &ldquo;He's taking a stand, he won't be pushed around!&rdquo; In reality, the gameplay in a high level match is occurring on the battlefield of frequencies&mdash;the individual hands usually are of token importance. Individual flop checkraises and preflop 3-bets compose the structure of the match, and the adjustments and frequencies that each player adopts are what constitute the actual gameplay. This is invisible to those not privy to how high stakes matches are played, which makes it impossible for an amateur to really understand the dynamics of such a match.

But in spite of the fact that little gameplay occurs within individual hands, there nevertheless seem to be some hands which can be described as genuinely beautiful. How is this possible, if gameplay is taking place within the interplay of ranges and large-scale adjustments? Beautiful hands are rare, no doubt. But once in a while, we do see a hand that seizes our awe.

I think what defines beauty in poker is not just gameplay within structure, but gameplay that challenges structure. Structure, remember, are the constraints we perceive upon the field of gameplay. But there are times when inspiration strikes a player to see beyond structure, and to harness some tool or technique that seems to be structurally disallowed. These are the moments that we see as beautiful&mdash;the beauty is in the breaking of the rules that we realize were never really rules. It's to capture that eloquent, unexpected solution.

#### An Eloquent Unexpected Solution

When I conducted those interviews with the high stakes players, it was around the time that the QT hand that Durrrr played on High Stakes Poker had just aired. It caused quite a stir among poker aficionados, and two of the players I interviewed actually mentioned it as an example of a beautiful hand of poker. Here it is.

Eastgate and Durrrr are 500k deep, and Barry is 200k deep. The blinds are 400/800 with a 200 ante, and Barry Greenstein opens under the gun for 2500 with AA. Durrrr who is immediately to his left calls with QTs, six other players behind him call, including Peter Eastgate in the small blind with 42s. The flop comes down 22T. Peter checks, and Barry leads out the flop for 10k. Durrrr makes it 37k, Peter overcalls, and Barry calls as well. The turn comes down an 8 and they both check to Durrrr, who bets 104k. Peter Eastgate folds quickly, and Barry folds after some thinking.

The vast majority of people who commentated on this hand had a poor understanding of what was actually going on. When Barry's bet comes around to Durrrr, the standard play is going to be to fold (Barry is betting here into 8 players, so he almost certainly has something after raising UTG). The way that full ring players are conditioned to react to a spot where there are 8 players in the pot and UTG bets into them is to realize that a lot of strength is being represented here by this action, and so they fold all but the strongest of hands. The structure of the action (the positions, board texture, and amount of players in the pot) are supposed to create a situation where Durrrr has to play straightforwardly. This is the structure of this situation. But instead of obeying this structure, he goes the other way&mdash;he exploits the the fact that he has a ten, which blocks the most likely nuts (TT), and he decides to strong-arm the structure of the hand and use it to his advantage. When UTG+1 raises the UTG player with 7 players left to act in a pot with 9 players on a board where UTG obviously has something, it represents enormous strength and an indifference as to what action occurs behind.

When he makes the raise, Peter Eastgate overcalls from the small blind, and Barry calls as well, and the turn comes down a blank. Durrrr bets the turn a big size&mdash;one that seems to signal to Eastgate that he's looking to get all-in, and one that has Barry completely covered. Once Peter Eastgate overcalls the flop, it's very obvious that his range includes some 2's, TT, and 22. The structure has become *again* intensified, because all players in the hand know that every other player acknowledges this structure, and so when Durrrr bets the turn big even when he knows what is meant by Eastgate's overcall, Eastgate's decision must acknowledge this fact. He knows that Durrrr is not stupid, and so he's going to play his hand value relative to what is dictated by the structure of the hand and everybody's perceived ranges. Now, of course if Eastgate had had 22, Durrrr would have not looked as spectacular, but it was a risk that he took, and I suspect he was not going to beat himself up over it if Eastgate turned out to have had quads.

It wasn't just the fearlessness that Durrrr demonstrated or the fact that he bluffed for such an enormous pot, or even that he bluffed Eastgate off of trips and Barry off of aces up. What's beautiful about the hand is how Durrrr managed to find an eloquent solution that challenged the basic structure of how the hand was supposed to be played.

#### Ascending the Ladder

Now, I won't get carried away here. I won't say that this bluff that Durrrr made was a sudden spark of creativity or some kind of eureka moment that broke full ring poker wide open. The bluff itself is actually fairly basic, and I'm sure Durrrr makes these kinds of bluffs with some regularity when the opportunity presents itself. If you wanted to, you could just call it something as simple as balance (i.e., since Durrrr is bluffing here so rarely, he has to include the occasional bluff, and if you look at the situation holistically QT is the best hand to do it with). High caliber full ring players make this kind of bluff all the time I'm sure&mdash;if they didn't, then it'd be far too easy to play in these situations, and they'd be missing out on too much bluffing EV since they usually get credit for having hands. The hand is beautiful because it demonstrates mastery, as Durrrr certainly understood everything that was going on (he basically called both of their hands when the hand was over), and its defiance of structure. But in spite of that, there are many other hands like it that could be summoned, which moves it closer and closer to being structurally sound (something like &ldquo;standard&rdquo;).

Ultimately, the higher and higher you go on the ladder of poker prowess, the more difficult it is to find hands that an expert player will consider beautiful. If a hand is demonstrative of mastery, then the highest caliber poker players understand the inherent concepts and employ them whenever they can in their games. If you asked somebody like Durrrr or LarsLuzak for an example of a beautiful hand, they'd have much more difficulty producing an example than a mid to low level player would. This is because of all of the possibilities that are available in poker, players like Durrrr and Lars have explored so many of them and can see every inch of gameplay that is possible (that is, they are not obstructed by false structure), and so there is very little that appears to them as genuinely novel or beautiful. The situation would either have to be very rare for it to seem beautiful (because it would come about so rarely, they could appreciate the moment of discovering a solution), or it would have to manifest itself not in a hand, but in the higher level gameplay of adjustments and counter-adjustments..

Poker is all about possibilities, and the moment of discovering a new possibility is the sweetest feeling for a poker player. For a beginner, you might imagine that they'd find the most mundane of poker dogma, such as folding ace-ten offsuit from under the gun, as a beautiful solution to a difficult problem. And as we move up the ladder, players start to appreciate more subtle and surprising solutions to various problems, slowly uncovering more and more of the field of gameplay. Even experienced players often speak of &ldquo;aha&rdquo; moments, at which point their understanding of poker suddenly jumped up to another level, or some concept which they once didn't really grasp was suddenly elucidated. I think these are the moments in poker we all hunger for. There is, truly, no greater delight than that moment of discovery. When we emerge out of the cave of ignorance, and the light of realization blinds us with its brilliance… it is then that the universe of possibilities unfurls itself before us. And indeed, it is a thing of beauty.

- <span class="term">$1/$2, $5/$10, $10/$20</span> A way of notating the size of the blinds in the stakes being played. $10/$20 means a $10 small blind, and a $20 big blind. In this book, it generally refers to no-limit stakes, so a normal buyin for a $10/$20 game is 100 big blinds, or $2000.
- <span class="term">3-bet</span> To reraise; a raise over a raise. (The initial bet on any street is a 1-bet, the raise a 2-bet, but those terms are not used. Preflop, the big blind is considered the initial bet, so the first raise is a 2-bet.)
- <span class="term">4-bet</span> To reraise a reraise; to raise a 3-bet.

#### A

- <span class="term">Air</span> Cards that completely missed the board; a nothing hand.

#### B

- <span class="term">Backdoor</span> To hit a hand using the turn and river cards, and only one or no flop cards. Generally considered to be a sneaky (or lucky) hand to hit. Synonymous with &ldquo;runner runner.&rdquo;
- <span class="term">Bad Beat</span> To initially have a stronger hand than your opponent, but have your opponent get lucky and improve his hand, causing you to lose.
- <span class="term">Balance</span> Having different kinds of hands (such as strong and weak) in your range to &ldquo;balance&rdquo; it out.
- <span class="term">Baller</span> Slang for someone with a lot of money, or someone very successful. Derives from footballer or basketballer.
- <span class="term">Bankroll</span> The amount of money you have allocated for playing poker. Also known as your &ldquo;roll.&rdquo;
- <span class="term">Barrel</span> To bet continually postflop.
- <span class="term">Bb (big blind)</span> The minimum possible bet in a no-limit or pot-limit game. Also refers to the player at the table who's in the position of having to pay the big blind preflop (considered the worst position at the table).
- <span class="term">Betting Pattern</span> The sequence of bets that a player makes during a hand, or habits that a player has in how he bets certain hands. A player with a transparent betting pattern will implicitly reveal how strong he is during a hand.
- <span class="term">Bink</span> To get lucky and hit something.
- <span class="term">Blank</span> A card that doesn't change the board significantly. Usually a low card, but not always.
- <span class="term">Bluffcatcher</span> A hand that is strong enough to beat a bluff, but is not itself a strong hand. If the preflop raiser bet every street on A♣K<span class="red">♦</span>9<span class="red">♥</span> T<span class="red">♥</span>2♠, and you called him down with K<span class="red">♦</span>Q<span class="red">♥</span>, that would be a bluffcatcher.
- <span class="term">Board</span> The totality of the community cards. We say the board &ldquo;changes&rdquo; if the addition of a new community card dramatically affects hand values.
- <span class="term">Board Texture</span> The way the arrangement of community cards interact with each other. A board like 9♣4<span class="red">♥</span>2♠ would be a considered to have a &ldquo;dry&rdquo; texture, because the cards don't really interact with each other, and there are few draws or strong hands that connect with it. On the other hand, a board like J♠ 9♠ 8<span class="red">♥</span>would have a very &ldquo;drawy&rdquo; texture.
- <span class="term">Bumhunter</span> Someone who only waits around for very fishy players, and refuses to play anyone else. Generally a pejorative in poker culture.
- <span class="term">Button</span> The person with the dealer chip. This is the last player before the blinds, and the player with the best position.
- <span class="term">Buyin</span> The amount of money one brings initially to the table. It's also used as a measure of big blinds&mdash;one buyin is considered 100 big blinds, since that's the standard buyin for a no-limit game. (You can technically buy in for many different amounts though. In most games, there is a cap on how much you can buy in for, which varies depending on the structure and size of the game.)

#### C

- <span class="term">C-bet (continuation bet)</span> To follow up a preflop raise with a bet on the flop, regardless of how the board connects with one's hand. It's called a continuation bet because it's essentially a &ldquo;continuation&rdquo; of earlier aggression, exploiting the power of taking initiative.

- <span class="term">Checkraise</span> To first check, and then raise over a bet.
- <span class="term">Cold 4-Bet</span> To make your first raise be a 4-bet over someone's 3-bet. Basically, if some other player raises, and someone else reraises him, and you reraise that person as your very first bet, that's called a cold 4-bet.
- <span class="term">Connect</span> For a hand to interact positively with the board in some way. Your hand connects with the board usually if you've made a pair or a draw.

#### D

- <span class="term">Deepstacked</span> Playing with generally 200 big blinds or more at a table.
- <span class="term">Donk</span> Donk can be either a noun or a verb: as a noun, it's slang for a donkey, or a bad player. As a verb, to donk can mean to lead out into the preflop raiser before he gets a chance to bet, or in a phrase such as &ldquo;donk around,&rdquo; it can mean to act stupidly.
- <span class="term">Donkey</span> A bad or stupid player. Pejorative.
- <span class="term">Downswing</span> An extended losing streak.
- <span class="term">Draw</span> A draw (or drawing hand) is a hand that is not yet complete, and needs another card in order to become a strong hand. Four cards of one suit (drawing to a flush) and four consecutive cards (drawing to a straight) are the most common.
- <span class="term">Drawy</span> A drawy board is one on which drawing hands are likely, or with which many good starting hands will connect with draws. J♠ 9♠ 8<span class="red">♥</span>is an example of a board with a very drawy texture.
- <span class="term">Dry</span> A dry board is a disconnected, unsuited board, with which most starting hands won't connect or make draws. A board like 9♣4<span class="red">♥</span>2♠ is an example of a dry board.

#### E

- <span class="term">Early Street</span> The earlier betting rounds in a poker hand. This typically refers to preflop and the flop.

- <span class="term">EV</span> Expected value; this refers to how much money you should win or lose *on average* for a given decision. EV is a statistical concept&mdash;in a sense, it's what you &ldquo;should be making&rdquo; for any given play.
- <span class="term">Exploitation</span> Taking advantage of weaknesses in an opponent's game. For example, if someone is bluffing too much, you can exploit them by calling more bluffcatchers; if someone is bluffing too little, you can exploit them by never bluffcatching.

#### F

- <span class="term">Flatcall</span> To call.
- <span class="term">Flatting</span> Also means to call. Short for flatcalling.
- <span class="term">Float</span> To call a bet with air, usually intending to take away the pot on a later street by betting or raising. Tricky players will float often.
- <span class="term">Flop</span> The flop consists of the first three community cards. &ldquo;The flop&rdquo; can refer to either the community cards, or to the round of betting which occurs once the first three community cards are dealt.
- <span class="term">Flopping a Hand</span> To immediately make a strong hand using the first three community cards&mdash;the flop.
- <span class="term">Fold</span> To throw away your hand against a bet.
- <span class="term">FPS</span> Fancy Play Syndrome. Poker slang for being too elaborate or fanciful in one's play, where a simpler decision would've been better.
- <span class="term">Frontbet</span> To bet into the preflop raiser.

#### G

- <span class="term">Game Flow</span> The pattern of decisions and emotions that occur over time between two people. Game flow is very intuitive and highly complex, and so can often not be communicated adequately unless one sees all of the hands that contribute to it.
- <span class="term">Grinding</span> To play poker, usually in a slow and steady fashion.
- <span class="term">Gutshot</span> A straight draw that can be completed with only one card. For example, having 9♣T<span class="red">♦</span> on 2<span class="red">♥</span>6♠7♣, where only an 8 can make a straight.

#### H

- <span class="term">Heads-up</span> One-on-one.

We all come to poker with a blank slate. No one arrives knowing how to identify a SA/WB, read a flop texture, or spot a cooler. We learn these things through the feedback that poker provides us. And yet, though poker gives us all essentially the same feedback, some of us become proficient and others do not. One of the strongest determinants of how good a player will become is in how they respond to that feedback.

How do we become masterful in poker? How do our responses and attitudes toward feedback determine our skill level? And what can we ultimately do to better orient ourselves toward feedback?

In this final article on learning, we'll be delving into the science of mastery, how to position ourselves so that we respond as optimally as possible to feedback, how to avoid loss aversion and other pitfalls in self-conditioning, the power of self-talk, and we'll discuss some tips on how to maximize our efficiency as learners.

In previous chapters, we have skirted around the concept of mastery, but let's now face it head on. As poker players, this is ultimately the one goal we all have in common: mastery of our craft.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uOR8t1UVJ4c">[video]</div>

## The Science of Mastery

The definition of **mastery** can be elusive, since it's subjective what we consider masterful. After all, to a 5¢/10¢ player, any $1/$2 regular might seem masterful, whereas to Phil Ivey, perhaps *no one* seems masterful. The exclusivity of &ldquo;mastery&rdquo; depends on your vantage point.

But for simplicity, we'll accept some ambiguity in our definition. We'll say that mastery is &ldquo;reaching the highest level of proficiency in an art.&rdquo; So a master could be a concert pianist, a chess grandmaster, a professional athlete, or, for poker, a consistent mid-high stakes regular.

The science of mastery was famously explicated by Malcolm Gladwell in his book *Outliers*, which was largely based on the research of Swedish psychologist Anders Ericsson. According to this research, achieving mastery is the result of a supportive environment and continual, consistent effort, rather than due to innate skill or natural &ldquo;genius&rdquo;. More contemporary studies have posited two key elements to acquiring mastery: 10,000 hours of deliberate practice, and a capable mentor. (We will focus on the first element in this article; we will discuss mentorship in a later article.)

10,000 hours is an intimidating number. If we take this number literally, for someone who's been playing poker for five years, playing 360 days a year, in order to have reached 10,000 hours, they'd need to have played about 6 hours a day, every day. If you've been playing poker for eight years, that number adjusts to about 3½ hours a day. These numbers might seem daunting&mdash;but it's important to remember that there are different levels of success in poker (you can be a top $2/$4 regular, or a losing $10/$20 regular). Furthermore, studies have shown that the 10,000 hours rule famously touted by Gladwell isn't so clear-cut&mdash;depending on the field, that number may range from 8,000 to 25,000 hours. For poker, chances are, it's on the lower end, since it's a relatively young game, and many masters of poker have been playing less than ten years (whereas the best concert pianists have been training all their lives). So you should take this to mean not so much that there's a magic number of hours that you need to play, but more simply that you just need to play *a lot* to get to the highest arena of the game.

So, the dictum goes, &ldquo;10,000 hours of **deliberate practice**.&rdquo; What is deliberate practice? Ericsson theorized that it is not enough to merely perform a skill a large number of times; *how* you practice is the key to whether you will ever attain mastery. Here are some of the essential properties of good deliberate practice:

1. Breaking down skills into smaller chunks, and rehearsing those specific skill chunks
2. Continually practicing the skill at more and more challenging levels
3. Being very conscious and attendant toward feedback and mistakes, with the intention toward mastery

What makes practice &ldquo;deliberate&rdquo; becomes very clear&mdash;rigorous effort with the intention to dissect a skill and master every part of it.

This is all well and good for mastering a piano sonata, but what about poker? In poker there's no such thing as &ldquo;practising&rdquo;&mdash;you can only *perform* it (since play money is nothing like the actual thing). A concert pianist can practise his piece a hundred times before a recital at Carnegie Hall, but it's impossible for a player to practise taking a shot at Jungleman unless he actually *plays* Jungleman. Or is it?

This problem troubled me for a long time. What does practice mean in a game that is all performance? Is poker some kind of exception from the conventional concept of mastery? After pondering this problem for some time, I eventually came to the conclusion that although poker has some particular nuances of its own, the same rules that apply to other forms of mastery hold true for poker.

Poker has some counterparts to deliberate practice, like studying or [watching videos](http://https://haseebq.com/learning-how-to-learn-the-three-types-of-learning-and-the-three-fold-path-2/). Ultimately, however, they are not enough. The only thing that qualifies as true, deliberate practice is *deliberate play*. Play *is* practice in poker. Every session in which you are paying your full attention to your errors and trying to learn from them, in which you are actively trying to train a particular weakness, e.g., to take more risks, play more conservatively, or learning to play deepstacked&mdash;when, that is, you are listening as closely as possible to**what poker is telling you&mdash;*this* is deliberate practice.

Thus, it is not enough to have done 10,000 hours of mindless grinding or 24-tabling. It *must* be deliberate. You *must* be listening to feedback from poker, and using it to inform changes in your game. In order for each session you play to count towards your goal, it must be a conscious, intelligent, and measured attempt to improve and monitor your weaknesses. There are only two types of players who are ever able to quickly shoot up through the stakes&mdash;those who put in many hours in a short time, or those who are profoundly rigorous with their playing and studying habits. This is the only viable path to mastery&mdash;genius alone always falls short.

## Orienting Yourself Toward Feedback

We've already discussed things like isolation drills and elaborative rehearsals, which can help make our practice more deliberate, but on the whole, practicing poker is trickier than practising most other things. If you are practising a piano sonata, by playing the piece through, you can usually hear whether or not you've misplayed a note, but as a poker player, you don't always know when you've made a mistake. Poker is constantly giving us feedback, but that feedback is noisy, chaotic. This is partly why poker is such a difficult game to learn.

Feedback causes mental conditioning&mdash;positive feedback will reinforce a behavior, while negative feedback will discourage it. Imagine your brain as a little mouse in a cage, which is either fed little pellets, or shocked by electricity. Usually, you get fed pellets for being good, and zapped for being bad. But in poker, both pellets and shocks sometimes come down randomly. It can sometimes seem like there's no rhyme or reason&mdash;pellet, shock, pellet, shock, shock, pellet. With all of this chaos, your little mouse is bound to get confused, and come up with all sorts of strange and outlandish explanations of why pellets and shocks appear (which, unsurprisingly, is exactly what novice poker players do&mdash;when I was playing NL10, after losing a few big pots to 25o and 34o, I used to believe that playing low cards was smart, because no one would ever guess when I'd hit two pair or trips).

This is the basis of being **results-oriented**. Somebody who is results-oriented will respond to the surface-level feedback that poker is giving him. For example, if he makes a bluff that fails, he will often get discouraged and assume that it's bad. Being results-oriented means that you're conditioned by what poker does in *this* instant&mdash;whether it shocks you or feeds you a pellet*.* But poker is capricious and as experienced and thoughtful players, we ought to know this. So instead of letting poker shock or feed our brains, *we* must take hold of the lever, don our labcoats, and become the scientist feeding or zapping our mouse brains.

We want to be **process-oriented**. Instead of focusing on results and winning every hand, we focus instead on going through the right decision making process, on making plays that will be good *in the long run*. This gives us the ability to make plays that may lose in one instance, without becoming negatively conditioned against making that play again. *It gives us control over our own conditioning*. Being process-oriented allows us to circumvent some of the stochasticity and chaos of poker, and more directly shape our brains toward an ideal game.

That's all well and good, you might say. But how do I *become* process-oriented? How do I stop feeling bad when I lose an individual hand? There are two answers to this problem&mdash;the first is that it gets easier with time. Lose enough hands and you'll become desensitized to losing, eventually no longer feeling the negative conditioning that often comes with it. But the second answer is a bit more complicated&mdash;and that brings us back to the realm of cognitive biases.

## Loss Aversion and Other Feedback Imbalances

**Loss aversion bias** is the observation that people are inherently irrational in risk-taking&mdash;they overvalue averting losses, and undervalue making new gains. For example, if you're in a 300bb pot, and you have 200bb behind with which to bluff shove the river, and you think that he's folding 50% of the time&mdash;would you shove, or would you fold? Even with these assumptions, many people check back this river because their mind is inherently biasing them toward keeping what money they have. The 200bb they already own have feels *more valuable* than the 300bb in the middle. Another way of saying this is that losing 200bb feels worse than winning the 300bb in the middle feels good.

In reality, every dollar should be equal to every other dollar (in most cases). A dollar gained should be equally as good as a dollar lost is bad.

This bias is one of the most difficult to overcome, because, ultimately, emotion plays a huge role in how we make internal decisions in poker&mdash;not simply in terms of strategy, but also in terms of how we play, when we play, and who we play. To combat this bias and become more process-oriented, perhaps your most valuable tool is self-talk.

**Self-talk** is the process of mentally &ldquo;talking to yourself&rdquo; while you're doing something. It's a ubiquitous feature of our mental lives, as we are constantly praising, reminding, and chastising ourselves as we act in the world. There are three basic types of self-talk: positive, negative, and instructional. Positive self-talk is self-reinforcing, such as &ldquo;I've got this in the bag,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I'm so sick!&rdquo; Negative self-talk is self-rebuking, such as &ldquo;god, I'm such a donk,&rdquo; or &ldquo;how could I make that call?&rdquo; Instructional self-talk, on the other hand, is a mental reminder or walk-through on how to execute something, such as &ldquo;okay, call this turn and then shove any blank river,&rdquo; or &ldquo;don't tilt, stay calm, and wait for him to 3-bet you again.&rdquo;

It's unsurprising that positive self-talk is vastly better for performance than negative self-talk. But, interestingly, studies have shown that instructional self-talk actually produces better performance than positive self-talk. Thus, it is in your interest to mentally talk to yourself and, essentially, to coach yourself through your poker game in your mind (that's not to say that positive self-talk doesn't serve an important function, as we'll discuss later). But it's instructional self-talk that best remedies the problem of loss aversion bias.

Instructional self-talk can help our rational mental processes overcome and influence the biases of our unconscious mind. If you tell yourself &ldquo;it's okay I lost two buyins, because I had a good shot at three buyins, and that was hugely +EV,&rdquo; by saying this to yourself enough times *you will learn to accept this as a satisfactory justification. *By repeatedly instructing yourself and tempering your natural loss aversion with self-talk, you can counteract the natural impulse of your mind to inhibit whatever behavior led to that loss. You can do the same thing to counter other cognitive biases, such as first-impression bias (your tendency to cling to first impressions longer than you should). Self-talk is an invaluable tool for a poker player, one that needs to be developed right alongside any other.

As the loss aversion bias demonstrates, quite often our brains do not interpret different kinds of feedback with equal weight. I call these **feedback imbalances**. Because of feedback imbalances, our brains provide their own additional layer of noise over and above the distortion inherent to poker.

Consider **negative events**. A negative event is when you decide *not* to do something you were considering doing. Negative events happen all the time&mdash;you elect not to 4-bet, or decide against a flop checkraise. The problem with negative events in poker is that we rarely allow them to strongly condition us.

Say, for example, you're in a big pot, you've barrelled two streets, and you're deciding whether or not to bluff the river. If you barrel the river and he folds, you win the pot, you feel really good, and get a big chunk of positive conditioning. If you bluff the river and he calls your bluff, you lose, and you get a big chunk of negative conditioning. But what if, after some consideration, you *don't* bluff the river, you lose, and he shows the nuts? You might feel a little sense of relief, but probably you'll feel relatively neutral, and perhaps even a little irked that he had the nuts and won the pot. There is a feedback imbalance here&mdash;when you make the right decision by barrelling and he folds, you get a lot of psychological reinforcement that it was a good play. But when you make the right decision by checking and he wins with the nuts, you get very little reinforcement that you made the right play. The latter doesn't *feel *like a win, when strategically it is.

Another prominent feedback imbalance is in hero calls. Think about the last time you made a hero call with ace high in a big pot. If you were right, you probably felt amazing&mdash;heroic, even, as the term suggests. You got an enormous surge of positive feedback when you called, a surge that was repeated every time you showed that call to a friend. But what happens when you call with ace high and lose? Well, some of the time you might feel really stupid, especially if you get berated. But most of the time, you'll probably just think to yourself: &ldquo;well, I knew I was beating his bluffs, and he happened to have it this time. I still don't know if it was a good call.&rdquo; Or, if he had a bluff that beat you, you might think to yourself, &ldquo;damn! I knew he was bluffing! So sick!&rdquo;

This might not ring true for you, but it does for many players. Hero calls carry a lot of psychological baggage, because we tend to glorify them in a way that we don't other poker hands. It's almost as if they're exempt from the normal rules of poker diligence. As a result, failed hero calls tend to get relatively little negative feedback, while successful hero calls get overwhelmingly positive feedback. In terms of the emotional calculus, you can see that your brain *incentivizes *you to make outrageous hero calls. After all, it doesn't feel that bad when you lose, and it feels amazing when you win. Hence, hero calls introduce a troublesome feedback imbalance.

So what can we do to equalize feedback imbalances? The answer comes back again to self-talk. Using positive self-talk, you can reinforce behaviors and plays that on its own, poker does a poor job of reinforcing. For example, after checking the river in a big pot and not firing a final barrel, once he shows down the nuts, instead of simply allowing yourself to feel bad or neutral that he won that medium-large pot, you might instead mentally tell yourself, &ldquo;Good job not firing that river bluff. He would've called. Good play.&rdquo; With hero calls, you can do a couple of things to equalize the feedback. First, you can engage in negative self-talk (followed by instructional self-talk) to make a failed hero call more likely not to get brushed over by your brain: &ldquo;damn, I shouldn't have made that call. Bad play. Be more careful with hero calls.&rdquo; Second, you could try to dampen the positive reinforcement by successful hero calls to make things more even. For example, you could make a rule for yourself that you're not allowed to show off your hero calls to any of your friends. This would remove a large part of the psycho-social incentive to making the hero call to begin with, and make you more likely to simply focus on making the best play in a vacuum.

Related to the idea of a feedback imbalance is the concept of **indicative strength**. Indicative strength is, simply put, how much information a certain fact (a hand he shows, or a play he makes) gives about your opponent's game. I'll illustrate with a non-poker example, for simplicity.

Say you have a jar of marbles. You can't see inside it, but you know that there are 100 marbles, and there are only two possible overall configurations: there are either 95 red and 5 blue, or 65 red and 35 blue. You don't know which of these configurations it is, nor the probability of each configuration, but you are allowed to draw out one marble. So let's say you draw out a marble and it's red&mdash;this is an event of low indicative strength. That is, it doesn't tell you much about whether the jar is 95% red or 65% red. It could easily be either. But if you draw out a first marble and it's blue, this is has very high indicative strength&mdash;it makes it *more *likely that it's the 35% blue configuration..

Using marbles, this concept might seem self-evident. But in poker, the confluence of emotions, noise, and complexity make it much harder to properly attribute probabilities. For example, in a spot where you call top pair because you think your opponent has either the nuts or a missed draw, in the event that he shows you the nuts, you generally accept a *large* chunk of negative conditioning&mdash;&ldquo;god, I'm such a donk, I should've folded.&rdquo; Quite often, his showing down the nuts is an event of low indicative strength&mdash;he would have the nuts sometimes whether you thought he was bluffing with his draws or not, and so you shouldn't be very strongly conditioned by it. But when your unconscious mind loses a big pot (because it naturally wants to find significance in everything), it doesn't account for that. It simply sees a hand you lose to, and rings the hurt bell.

Our unconscious minds tend to be very poor at processing data for its indicative strength, and so we must use our conscious minds to calibrate our reactions (and thereby, our self-conditioning). Self-talk, again, is a powerful remedy. By telling ourselves: &ldquo;I knew he might have the nuts either way; that doesn't tell me anything about whether my play was good,&rdquo; we mollify some of the negative conditioning that comes with losing that pot.

We must always be vigilant with our conscious minds, and learn to orchestrate the dialogues in our heads. Eventually, with enough practice, your unconscious mind will learn to interpret such events in a way such that you no longer need to consciously regulate it (that is, attributing indicative strength will reach a level of unconscious competence). But until then, you must be rigorous with your mental dialogue to calibrate your own self-conditioning. Self-talk is one of the few things over which you have genuine control in poker, and so you must wield and master it as best you can.

## The Pitfalls of Hand Histories

There are some pitfalls in learning that are more deeply entrenched, and often, more difficult to see. One such pitfall is what's known in psychology as **context-dependent memory**. This is the phenomenon by which something that is learned in one context is much better retained, retrieved, and reinforced within the same context. So in short, if you want to retrieve a memory, you should put yourself in the same context you learned it (e.g., go to the same place, engage the same senses, put yourself in the same physical state). This might seem obvious, but it has one very important implication to the learning of poker.

If your first thought was &ldquo;hand histories,&rdquo; you're right on the money. Hand histories are, in a very important sense, *alien* to the context in which we actually play poker. Think about it. A hand history is a big, meticulous, awkward block of text. It has no sense of time, it (usually) has no visual cues at all, and it is static, while an actual poker hand involves movement and action&mdash;the way you experience a hand history is completely**different from the way you actually experience the living hand of poker. The effect of this is that learning you gain from a hand history (or books or forums) is not going to be fluidly exported when actually playing poker.

This partially explains the existence of players who offer robust analysis on hands, but who are much weaker at actually playing poker. There's various names for this phenomenon: &ldquo;theory crafters&rdquo; and &ldquo;keyboard jockeys,&rdquo; among others&mdash;these people have learned most of their poker skills in the context of hand histories, perhaps by reading lots of forums or watching videos, but they have difficulty retrieving that learning during an actual poker game.

How can we avoid this pitfall? To some extent, our psychology makes the problem is intractable. The further we move from the context of learning, the more difficult recall will be, period. But there are a few things we can do to make our learning more effective when crossing over contexts.

The first and most effective thing to do is *to try to emulate the native context*. I.e. do everything you can to make a hand history more like an actual hand of poker. Try to put every important hand you want to learn from in a hand replayer, so you get more visual feedback, like a real hand of poker. This might seem simple or a waste of time, but the cues it activates make it much more likely you'll be able to retrieve the learning in a real game. Even more powerfully&mdash;try visualizing the hand *as though it were real*. Try to invoke the poker-playing part of your brain to accept the conditioning you're receiving. Close your eyes and imagine the money amounts, what they would mean to you, the timer ticking down, and making the right play. The closer you get your experience of hand histories to the actual experience of playing poker, the more effective your learning will be. Go out of your way to make this happen! It's a pain, and it can sometimes seem awkward and unnecessary, but it'll dramatically improve your learning and retention in the long run.

A second thing you can do is to try to boil down your learning from hand histories (and forums and books) into cues that can be imported as self-talk. For example, let's say you read a hand that shows a great river 3-bet bluff. Instead of simply thinking to yourself, &ldquo;I'm going to do that next time&rdquo; (a commitment that usually never materializes), write down an actionable piece of self-instruction. For example, &ldquo;when you can rep the absolute nuts, 3-bet bluff the river.&rdquo; Keep that piece of paper with you the next time you play a session of poker; ideally, read over it periodically to remind yourself of this piece of self-instruction. This will make it much more likely that in the moment 3-bet bluffing the river is a possibility, this hand you read about will come back to you, and you'll be more likely to make an uncharacteristic play.

## The Hubris of Theory

In my last three articles, I have ardently extolled the virtues of poker theory and rigorous study. But I should also make clear that I don't believe theory is all-powerful. Some players, especially ones who are mathematically inclined, can have a rosy conception of how poker works. In their minds, poker is just a mathematical construct&mdash;a puzzle, with a discrete solution. They imagine that if locked in a room for 20 years with a calculator, they could develop a poker game so robust that it could take down the best player in the world.

These players imagine poker consists merely of figuring out a set of strategies, as though writing them out on a notecard&mdash;&ldquo;how to play poker&rdquo;&mdash;such that having the right set of strategies on your notecard will make your game impregnable. Of course, that's not how poker works. Poker must be *learned*; you must absorb that learning into your bones. Your brain must get conditioned into the right network, which takes many hundreds of thousands of hands. You needn't worry about mapping out all of your strategies, or obsessing over the mathematics. Focus on getting the learning into your fingers. I have known countless players who were more mathematically capable at describing poker than I was, but who couldn't stay afloat in a $1/$2 game.

Imagine a difficult poker hand you've played. You imagine, don't you, that there's some way to theoretically break this hand down and trace the &ldquo;right answer,&rdquo; like a scientist looking from above on his lab rat's maze? Theory will show you this&mdash;the right theory. This is what we believe. Why?

You want to see it from up there, the scientist's view, but in reality, you are the rat caught in the maze. You will never be the scientist. You're trapped, and you will always be. You don't have access to perfect theory, and you don't know how your theory is imperfect. It's quite possible that, in everything that you know, it's *impossible* for your &ldquo;theory&rdquo; to lead you to the optimal solution. You might believe in some part of your mind that poker is a beautiful, righteous, mathematically pristine game. But you, the learner of poker, are merely a rat in its maze, and you must find your way out. Reason will not always save you.

----

The limitations of poker theory are very real, and must be taken seriously. In my next article, I will be exploring the nature of poker theory and poker language, focusing on how we actually use them to inform our play. Turns out, poker logic is not nearly as pristine&mdash;or logical&mdash;as you think. Stay tuned for next article!

So I'm starting over.

I've decided to give away all of my money. Two years after retiring from poker, I have left about half a million dollars. I'm giving some of it to charity, and the rest to my family to go toward my parents' retirement. I'm leaving myself $10,000 to live off&mdash;you know, in case I'm an idiot and everything goes horribly wrong.

Oh, and I just finished the book, which I've been working on for the last two years (as most of you who follow my blog already know). It's finally for sale, and you can get it [here.](https://www.amazon.com/How-Be-Poker-Player-Philosophy-ebook/dp/B00HFDJU6A/)

### Wait, wait, what? You're giving away all your money? Why?

I know, right? What the hell?

Well, I wanted a fresh start. I wanted to use what I've been given to help people who have been less fortunate. I also wanted to support my parents, who have done so much for me throughout the tough times in my life. I've been lucky in so many ways, it's only right that I do what I can to pay it forward.

On the whole, poker was an amazing (and surreal) experience. It taught me a lot; it was very generous to me. But I don't want to live in the shadow of it. I want to prove to myself that I didn't need poker. That my career as a poker player was not my apex, but just another stepping stone toward the rest of my life.

### Okay, okay. So if you're giving it away, can I have some?

No. Unless you're running a registered charity, in which case maybe. I've made my first donation to[ ICCS, the Indigenous Cultural Conservation Society](http://www.tribalstruggle.org), and I'm looking to donate to three more, but haven't settled on the other charities for sure yet. I prefer smaller charities, to minimize administrative waste and, ideally, maximize investment directly into projects. Most mega-charities funnel so much money back into marketing and fundraising, oftentimes only half of your donation actually goes toward charitable work.

So if you know of any awesome charities I should look at, tell me about it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hosseeb). I'm still in the process of researching them, and I want to complete all the donations before the end of the year.

The rest is going toward my parents' retirement. The older I get, the more I realize what amazing human beings they are. When I was born, they were poor, struggling immigrants living out of a tiny little apartment. They inspire me. I don't expect my life to become quite like that, but I try to remember how hard my parents had it. Probably harder than I ever will. I think they deserve a break, and hopefully this will give them one.

### How are you going to live off $10,000? That won't last you too long.

I know! I've started cutting back on costs as much as I can. I've always lived pretty simply though, even when I was a poker player. But now, I'm trying to live as frugally as I can. I'm also learning how to cook. I just learned how to hard-boil eggs. Yes, learned. As in, I couldn't do it before.

I can't make this stuff up, guys.

### What charities are you donating to?

I'm donating a total of $75,000 over three or four charities. Right now, the first charity I've picked out is [ICCS, the Indigenous Cultural Conservation Society](http://www.tribalstruggle.org). I've sent them $20,000. They're a nonprofit whose primary work is with the Masaai of east Kenya, working to educate them on sustainable, efficient agricultural practices (in a region of the world that is suffering from rapid desertification). I really just fell in love with their work. I encourage you to check them out, they're awesome people working toward an important, sustainable solution. Send them a donation! Seriously! This cause needs all the help it can get.

Update: the other charities I've donated to are [The Simama Project](http://thesimamaproject.org/) ($20,000 for awarding comprehensive scholarships to 7 Kenyan children to get them through high school), [charity: water](http://www.charitywater.org/whywater/) ($20,000 to build and maintain 6 water wells in Dadu, Pakistan), and [GiveDirectly](http://givedirectly.org/) ($15,000, matched by another $15,000 from Good Ventures; learn more about GiveDirectly from their [TAL episode](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/503/i-was-just-trying-to-help)).

### Do you have proof you did all this stuff?

Yep.

### Well, damn. Okay. And what's this about your book?

Yes! I just finished it. It's for sale now&mdash;[you can get it here](http://www.amazon.com/How-Be-Poker-Player-Philosophy-ebook/dp/B00HFDJU6A/). I'm pricing it for the first month at $2.99, because I want to make it as affordable as possible as a favor to people just starting out in poker; after that, it'll be priced normally at $9.99. Go pick it up. I know a lot of you guys on my blog have read a lot of my writings already, but it's super polished and sexy, and there's some new content as well. Plus it's just cool to have an actual for-real book, right? That's what people tell me, anyway.

If you want to help me out, please write me a review! Share this story or Tweet about it. Tell your friend, &ldquo;hey, this pile of pages is pretty awesome, go read it.&rdquo; Everything helps. This book has been such a labor of love for me. I was eighteen years old when I came up with the idea for this book, and it's kind of amazing now to think now it's finally been released.

Man, oh man.

Anyway, go pick it up! What are you waiting for?!

### Ah! Stop yelling at me!

Don't be like that.

[For those of you who don't know what's going on with me right now, [read this post first.](http://www.haseebq.com/starting-over/)]

Christmas has come and gone. It's never been a big day for me and my family. We don't celebrate Christmas. So mostly Christmas is a day when everything is closed, my friends are busy, and everything is dim and quiet. For me, it's a lonely time of year.

Two days before Christmas, my younger brother and I went out and bought a shitload of fruit, about 600 apples and bananas in total. We drove down to Front Steps Shelter on Christmas morning and set them out for the lined up homeless outside.

It was a simple thing, really. But thinking about it, this has been the first Christmas in a long time that I've felt good about. It's a good start.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Og-KuHMb2Ek">[video]</div>

The book has been doing amazing. Since the day after its release, it's been consistently ranked #1 among all poker books, with no signs of waning. It's doing way better than I expected! Most of that was with no reviews at all, and even now it still only has a couple. I know it's going to take you guys a while to get through it, but once you do, **please [leave a review](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HFDJU6A)**! Even if you're not going to gush, just getting your feedback is a huge, huge help.

<span class="note">(And if you haven't picked up the book yet, the price is going to go up to $9.95 after the new year; if you're strapped for cash, you should pick it up before then. Also, for those who like the smell of paper, **[I've just gotten the print version made!! You can get it here,](https://www.createspace.com/4581115)** and it'll also be available on Amazon around New Year.)</span>

----

These last two weeks have been exhausting. Since making my last blog post, all the attention and craziness and skepticism has really taken a toll on my mind. I suppose that's to be expected, though. Some seemed to believe that I'm not really doing this, or it's all some kind of a trick. For a while, that really upset me. It's hard to have a deeply personal decision be impugned and doubted by onlookers. But as my close friends have admonished me, in so many words: screw the haters.

I feel like I'm in a better place. I'm ready to take on new projects. I want to start producing more content, and I'll tell you guys more soon. Right now, the first priority is getting the print version of the book out&mdash;personally, I'm anxious to hold the physical book for the first time. For whatever reason, it still doesn't feel quite real. I'd been working on this book for almost two years, and even after seeing it do really well, my brain hasn't registered that *I actually wrote a fucking book*. The book that I'd been wanting to write since I was 19 years old. I still have the crazy little scratched up document on one of my hard drives, entitled &ldquo;The Philosophy of Poker.&rdquo;

I'm proud of this book. I struggle to say that for some reason, but it's true. I'm proud of it.

Okay, enough about my goddamn feelings.

## Here are some updates on the donations:

$20,000 to [ICCS](http://www.tribalstruggle.org), the Indigenous Cultural Conservation Society: [receipt posted here](http://www.scribd.com/doc/194144975/ICCS-Donation-Receipt). You can read more about them in my [previous post](http://www.haseebq.com/starting-over/).

$20,000 to [The Simama Project](http://thesimamaproject.org/): [receipt posted here](http://www.scribd.com/doc/193967057/EW-Donation-Receipt-SimamaProjectQureshi). This is a great charity that is also based out of Kenya. Essentially, they work with Kenyan street children, and based on both need and academic merit, they award substantial scholarships to allow kids to get off the street and into school.

The scholarships cover tuition, books, food, and medical checkup, so they're substantial and comprehensive to ensure that a kid has enough to get into school and see it through, even if their home life is rough. I've been told that the best way to allocate the donation is to try to fund 7 children through the entirety of high school. More details will be forthcoming in February, which is apparently when their yearly cycle starts, and they determine their next potential candidates.

My plan for the next donation is to make it to [charity: water](http://www.charitywater.org/whywater/). So far I've looked into several water charities, and charity: water is the most promising one I've found so far. They are a larger charity (ranked 67/70 on CharityNavigator), and they have a wide range of projects, so I'll know more about what specific project(s) I'll be donating to in the upcoming days.

**Okay, I think that covers it for now.** If any of you guys have any more suggestions for a final charity, please [give me a shout](http://www.haseebq.com/connect/). I've looked into everything people have suggested so far, but I haven't found anything so far that fits the criteria I laid out. Just a note, since I'm getting a lot of suggestions of foreign charities&mdash;they have to have 501(c) status in the United States! Otherwise I'd have to pay extra taxes on the donation, which would ultimately mean I wouldn't be able to donate as much. So as much as all these foreign causes are awesome, I'm afraid they're out of reach for me for the time being.

I'll end with a quote, which has been on my mind since all this.

> How could we forget those ancient myths that stand at the beginning of all races, the myths about dragons that at the last moment are transformed into princesses? Perhaps all the dragons in our lives are princesses who are only waiting to see us act, just once, with beauty and courage. Perhaps everything that frightens us is, in its deepest essence, something helpless that wants our love.
>
>  So you mustn't be frightened, dear Mr. Kappus, if a sadness rises in front of you, larger than any you have ever seen; if an anxiety, like light and cloud-shadows, moves over your hands and over everything you do. You must realize that something is happening to you, that life has not forgotten you, that it holds you in its hand and will not let you fall. Why do you want to shut out of your life any uneasiness, any misery, any depression, since after all you don't know what work these conditions are doing inside you? Why do you want to persecute yourself with the question of where all this is coming from and where it is going? Since you know, after all, that you are in the midst of transitions and you wished for nothing so much as to change.

I made my final donation yesterday. The $75,000 is now all accounted for. I sent $20,000 to [charity: water](http://www.charitywater.org/) for building water wells in rural Pakistan, and $15,000 to [GiveDirectly](www.givedirectly.org) (matched by another $15,000 by [Good Ventures](http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/our-giving-season-plans)), which will be distributed through Kenya and Uganda. I'll be updating the [original post where I announce I'm starting over](https://haseebq.com/starting-over/) with more information and the receipts once I get them.

The [*print edition* of the book is finally available on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/How-Be-Poker-Player-Philosophy/dp/0991306740/ref=tmm_pap_title_0). If you've gotten through it and haven't left a review, please, please do. If you've bought my book or supported me, thank you! It has been amazing to see this book that I've put so much work into be received so well.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VvdhCmeFQfU">[video]</div>

It's now the eve of a new year, and of a new chapter in my life. The molting is over. I have to make the plan work now. I feel giddy, and a little scared.

Once the ceremony is over, all that's left are the duties of life.

It was late October that I first told my parents that I'd decided to give away my money. It was an awkward thing to explain. My father nodded. My mother cried. She cries easily. She said she had seen how much I had suffered over the years during my life as a poker player. What was the point of all that if I was just going to give all the money away now?

Later that night, I went for a walk, which turned into a run. I used to take midnight walks outside my parents' house when I was a teenager. The stars out there, 20 miles outside of Austin, look sharp like points of steel. As I was running up this hill, I looked up and remembered when I was just 16 years old, looking up from the very same place, all the things I used to fantasize about doing someday. It made me laugh.

I used to dream about becoming a 10/20 player&mdash;the highest stakes I could imagine playing then. I dreamed of making a hundred thousand dollars. I longed, so badly, to become a successful poker player. And here I was now, having done those things, and now giving them up. To be standing on that hill, absorbing it all, it was like a feeling of culmination. I had started this race seven years ago, and in that moment I realized, I'd finished. It was over. The long of my life suddenly lay far behind me. In that moment, I felt like more blood was pumping through my veins than I was supposed to have in me.

I was elated. For the first time in a long time, I was full of confidence. I felt sadness too, but it did not make me sad. I felt fear too, but it did not make me afraid.

----

Once the new year starts, there won't be much more to say about all this. It's largely over, now all that's left is for me to adapt to living cheaply and hustle to support myself. I've started eating two meals a day to cut down on costs (while still eating paleo), and slashed the rest of my expenses to the bare minimums.

But closing out this chapter would probably not be complete without addressing some of the criticisms that people have raised against my announcement a couple weeks ago. There are always going to be doubters and haters on the Internet, and a lot of the criticism is just silly or spiteful. But there are some issues that thoughtful people have raised, so I wanted to address them here.

First, there's the claim that giving money to my parents is not really giving it away, because I'll get it back in inheritance. This one's a little absurd, I think. My parents are in their fifties and relatively healthy. Statistically, if I do get any money back in inheritance (assuming I'm still alive to receive it), it'll be whatever they have left *after all they've spent in their retirement*, minus estate tax, divided equally among me and my two brothers, after 25 years of inflation (and you'd also have to account for the opportunity costs).

Then, there's the contention that this is all a big publicity stunt, and that I don't really mean it. If by this people mean to point out that I intentionally released my book at the same time as I made this announcement, then yes. I did release my book at the same time, very intentionally. Of course I did. The plan was to release my book and give away my money before the end of the year, and I worked my ass off to get it done in time. That's not insincere, it's not something I'm hiding or ashamed of, and it certainly doesn't make all this somehow not real.

I've started over with just $10,000. It won't last me long. I needed to start making some money to support myself. But if this was a &ldquo;publicity stunt,&rdquo; then it'd be a fairly stupid one, giving away hundreds of thousands in order to make a few thousand dollars from book sales. Books don't make a lot of money. I don't know if that comes as a surprise to people, but they don't. That being said, of course I'd want my book to sell well, and for as many people to read it as possible. I finished my first book, gave away my money, and then posted about it on my blog&mdash;which is the place I've always posted about major life decisions and events. Doing those two things in concert don't comprise a publicity stunt.

Third, there's the claim that charity isn't charity at all if you tell people about it. This actually gets at an interesting question, and one I want to take on directly.

Why do people do charitable things? Because it feels right. Because it connects them to their community. Because it makes them feel better about themselves. Psychologists will tell you it's for the &ldquo;[warm glow and social approval](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-compass-pleasure/201108/is-your-brain-charitable-giving).&rdquo; Some people do it to satisfy a moral duty, or to allay their shame, or guilt, or loneliness. If an act only counts as charity if the actor doesn't benefit in any way, then this completely dismisses a huge category of good things that people do. It fails to capture the breadth of what we mean by charitable behavior. Charity is simply giving to others. Everyone is getting *something* out of charity, otherwise they wouldn't do it. That doesn't make it wrong, or uncharitable.

And yes, most people who do good things do it in view of others. Of course we do; human beings are social animals. Do we lay suspicion upon every charity drive? Upon every act of public giving? The idea of &ldquo;if it were really charity, it would be done without telling anyone&rdquo; is just wrong. Again, it throws out almost all acts of charity, and it implies a false dichotomy. Assuming the only two categories are &ldquo;egoless saint&rdquo; and &ldquo;hapless sinner&rdquo; just misses a lot. Public, visible giving *encourages more giving*. It makes people think &ldquo;oh, that's awesome. I should do that too.&rdquo; This is a well-demonstrated phenomenon, and in fact, people have told me that they were inspired to donate to charity as well upon reading my blog post.

People do good for all sorts of reasons. So what? Let them do good things. *Encourage it.* It's easy to be cynical, to try to cast everything as self-interested. If you look hard enough, almost all of it inevitably is. But who cares? Find the good in the world. Let the good be found. Allow yourself to be pleasantly surprised. If you want more good people in the world, be one yourself. Criticizing others for being imperfect isn't the way to do it.

 I'll be the first to admit I'm imperfect. But I'm trying, and I'm not ashamed of trying, or of failing. I'm moving forward, and I'm doing my best. When I gave away my money, it was a good thing, and it sits right with me. That's all it comes down to.

I've got nothing but love for you guys. Here's to a new year and a new beginning.

Today I've edited and cleaned up a post that I wrote many years ago. Back then, I was a solid 3/6 6-max grinder. I was the biggest winner on the PokerStars 6-max games and put in tons of volume, but I could never move up to 5/10. Every time I tried, I'd get smashed and would return to 3/6 to retool my coffers and try again. This was really disheartening, and caused me to take a long, hard look at my game and my journey as a poker player. For all you midstakes players out there, this is for you, and I think it's quite appropriate for starting a new year. I hope you enjoy it.

<div class="center">*Play this song as you read.*</div>

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2wSU4adAbSc">[video]</div>**(Little Haseeb, circa 2007)**

Okay, lately I've been thinking a lot about my game and why I'm not making obscene amounts of money. **I've come to realize something absolutely incredible about the way that I understand this game and my place in it.** I realize that I have been utterly blind to this… and probably, you are too.

I have realized that there is a common attitude among MSNL players that's utterly toxic to their development. It's this: as MSNL players, we treat &ldquo;being good&rdquo; as a vague and ethereal property that we ascribe to someone's game. But we don't think about &ldquo;being good&rdquo; in terms of particular situations or discrete attributes. I admit, I am guilty of this as much as anyone else, and the more I think about it, the more I see what a painful tragedy it is.

What does it mean to be good at poker?

Good players tend to look like us. They play spots like us. We read their thought processes, and we can follow them quite clearly. They post in our threads and share our opinions a lot of the time. We feel like we are probably good players too. We just have a few leaks, they're just &ldquo;a little better.&rdquo; We don't wonder why, or how. We don't look at our game and lament, &ldquo;This guy is doing something right that I am doing wrong. He is making more money than I am by doing things that I am not doing. When I decide what play is the best play, he's deciding that totally different plays are better.&rdquo; No, not at all. *He is just kind of better, I am just kind of worse.* That's how it is. Maybe, over time, I'll become better like him.

In the mid-stakes poker world, there is a great deal of respect for &ldquo;style.&rdquo; There is a certain point of scrutiny past which we will refuse to analyze people. &ldquo;That's just his style,&rdquo; we'll say. &ldquo;That play makes sense, but it doesn't fit my style.&rdquo; Well, guess what. **Fuck you, and fuck your style**. There's a big, ugly misconception of &ldquo;style&rdquo; as something artistic or special, something that makes you individual and inherently interesting because you play a certain way. That is a bullshit excuse for the fact that you're unwilling to take risks that you're not sure will work out or don't understand. Or, shit. How about it's simple denial of the fact that you are in fact bad at poker, and there are people much better than you who are making completely different plays?

Don't try to justify yourself with style, and don't try to excuse yourself from learning from other people's lines and creativity with the excuse of &ldquo;style.&rdquo; If you are not beating 200/400NL, *then your &ldquo;style&rdquo; doesn't mean shit*; all it's doing is holding you back from making better and more interesting plays than your bullshit midstakes grinder mind can be comfortable with.

Your game is not just the behaviors and actions that you enact, but the thought processes behind them, which formed those behaviors in the first place. When you battle against good players for your winrate, those thought processes will be what define you. Over time, we solidify those thought processes into habits, and those habits we continually reuse in later spots without rethinking them. Now, this is not necessarily a bad thing! A vast majority of these habits, for players who can beat mid-stakes, are going to be perfectly fine at the lowest levels (i.e., at playing most basic hands correctly, at beating fish). But for every poker player, there is some level of complexity at which your habits can no longer dictate the action for you, and you are forced to rationalize a new decision that you have essentially never made before. That is, you are forced to face this moment as new and original. Your &ldquo;poker logic&rdquo; cannot solve the problem for you, and the ghost in the shell is called upon to make its executive decision.

Now, there are three things that separate a mediocre player from a great player in this respect. The first of these three things is that that the great player has habitualized many of the decisions that a mediocre player has to rationalize (that is, for a great player the ghost in the machine is called upon less often). That's because the great player has much more experience and can use his poker logic to generate solutions to more situations. The second thing is that a great poker player's poker logic will be finer attuned to making precise and optimal plays than the mediocre player's. His habits will be closer to optimal, and he will have fewer sloppy habits. But the last and most important difference is that the great player is capable of subtly re-rationalizing many of the spots which deviate slightly from habitualized spots; that is, where a more mediocre player might be inclined to treat different variations on the same theme exactly the same, a great player will see a subtle difference in these spots, call upon his ghost in the shell, and let it decree a variation upon the habit already in place.

One of the biggest pitfalls to moving up is that people pay a great amount of attention to very salient spots, such as huge river decisions and bluffs, but they do not take the time or effort to re-rationalize lower level situations that contribute most significantly to their winrate. If you keep the fundamentals mostly the same as when you played 2/4 when you move up to 3/6 or 5/10, it may appear as if you're playing not much differently than other people do in the large pots, but actually, you're likely sacrificing *lots of EV* in the smaller or medium sized pots because you are not re-rationalizing many of the decisions which you treated as routine at lower limits.

The distinctions you have to make to be a great player are very fine and numerous. I think that's probably one of the big reasons why very good players tend to shoot up the stakes **much** faster than most people. It's a rarity that somebody shoots up the ranks from 5c/10c to $2/$4 extremely quickly, and then can't move up any higher. The reason for this, I think, is that such a person will be very used to treating poker strategy as a constantly dynamic organism, which he will formulate and reformulate in many degrees and aspects in whatever game he is playing, whereas somebody who plays the same stakes for a long time will realize that he'll simply be wasting his mental energy if he tries to think out every single routine spot he plays. The human brain does not and cannot work that way. It's simply not economical. Over time those repeated patterns become imprinted on your subconscious mind, to such an extent that when someone points at a decision you're about to make and asks you, &ldquo;why are you doing this?&rdquo;-you can't tell them. Maybe you'll say, &ldquo;well, the variables X, Y, and Z of course,&rdquo; but that's not really why you did it. The truth is, the thought process **NEVER** consciously entered your mind; you were merely recalling a pre-formulated response to the situation.

Now, I don't doubt that any intelligent player will be able to re-rationalize the situation and explain after the action what the original thought process &ldquo;should have been,&rdquo; had you had actually thought it out. However, mistaking the ability to recall a thought process afterward with having actually thought out in the moment is simply a fallacy, and in the long run if you don't have the self-awareness to recognize it, this fallacy will be your undoing. That is not to say that rationalizing your thought processes has to be done verbally, but the point is that most of us don't truly rationalize most of our important decisions. What this means, if you think about it closely, is that most of our leaks, most of where we're making our biggest and most profound mistakes… we are passing over in silence. We don't even give ourselves the chance to realize it. We are closing our eyes and riding the waves, without ever trying to learn how to perfect the ship we're sailing on.

To bring this all back, I think again about myself. As I've been ruminating about poker over the last few days, it strikes me that I've been committing a terrible but subtle fallacy in thinking about the game. It seems almost like a form of denial when I put it into words now. I realize that I have been treating the game of poker as combat between competing pre-rationalized strategies. You see, for a long time while I was grinding out 3/6, I didn't really make most of my decisions. What I mean by that is, it was very rare that I respected somebody enough to decide that I needed to re-rationalize my decisions for medium-large sized pots. I believed that I would be capable enough of winning just by completely relying on the intuitions that I'd acquired simply playing an enormous number of hands 12-tabling. *But I did not realize this at all!* In fact, I probably have vehemently denied it if you accused me of such a thing.

I was a winner, and that kept me complacent enough to know that I could beat everyone I was playing with. But it never really occurred to me that a good player, if he moved down to 3/6, would be making 6-7 ptbb/100. 6 to 7! That's enormous! I could never sustain that. What would he be doing differently than what I'm doing to increase his winrate so much? What fundamental mistakes am I making that he wouldn't?? He would be playing so much better than me, making such better reads and decisions than I would-he would be looking at the very same spots, and continually make completely different decisions. **Why didn't that occur to me?? Why didn't it frighten me, terrify me, drive me? How could I simply rest, knowing how wrong I was, all the time?** I must've been treating a higher-level player, somebody who'd be able to make 6-7ptbb/100 at my stakes, as merely a set of pre-rationalized strategies that were more &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; than mine. He wouldn't be thinking these things out, he'd just have already thought them out a long time ago and routinized them, and so he'd be chugging along with the same absentness of mind as I had. *But why do I let that excuse me from my own mediocrity? Why can I be okay with that?*

**Fuck. Fuck me. Fuck, fuck, fucking fuck.**

God, I don't know. This probably sounds like nonsense to a lot of you and maybe it is, I don't know. Poker is fucking crazy, and I'm really bad at it, and I want to get better.

Well, let me leave you with just one thought.

There are only three moves in poker: calling, betting, and folding. How can somebody who's only allowed to call, bet, or fold, be making so much more money than me?? It's only call, bet, or fold, but his decisions are making him so much more money than mine!

Cliffnotes: Shit, I gotta start call, betting, or folding better.

Thanks for reading,

My first ever purchase as a poker player wasn't made with money. It was made with FPPs. About a year after I started playing poker, I was $3/$6 reg with over $70,000 to my name, and I decided to cash in my FPPs on Pokerstars to buy an iPod. I was 16 years old, and my parents didn't have the slightest idea that I was a poker player, much less making tens of thousands of dollars. I still remember getting that iPod in the mail, slipping it out of the thin plastic wrap, and feeling its undeniable weight in my hands. I'd never had an iPod before. It seemed like an extravagant thing to have. Examining my name, engraved on the back of the metal case, I felt like I had gotten away with something. I wasn't supposed to have this.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gtq-RJCBWGE">[video]</div>

Much later, after confessing to my parents that I was playing poker, after becoming a well-known high-stakes player, after making over a million dollars playing $100/$200 by the age of 19, that feeling still persisted. Why did I have money? No one ever explained it to me. I was just playing poker, this game that fascinated me. But soon, I was buying a new car, investing in a house, furniture, a giant TV, 30″ monitors. My small blind was more expensive than any dinner I'd ever eaten, or any item I could buy in a supermarket. What did that mean? What was the point? Was I supposed to know?

As a young poker player, I was ushered into a very unhealthy relationship with money. It's a common theme among young poker pros. But unhealthy money habits are not limited to poker superstars. Even more common are the players who continually cash out, spend frivolously above their means, and are always broke or in debt.

Poker teaches us to dissociate money from its usual context. We're constantly drilled toward that idea&mdash;don't be results oriented, it's just chips, play without fear. After enough of this, most poker pros will eventually be able to change their perception of money at a poker table. It will no longer be betting a month's rent, or the down payment on a house&mdash;it will just be another move at a poker table.

But divorcing money from its usual context can be dangerous if it leaks over into your behavior away from the poker table. Once you start to think of an three-course meal or an expensive night out as &ldquo;just a buyin,&rdquo; frivolous spending becomes easier to justify. In poker we allow ourselves to lose; we accept our ups and downs as simply a matter of fact. Why not in life, too?

It's easy to get caught in this trap. Money comes easy in poker&mdash;it goes up and down all the time. But by continually cashing out and spending lots of money, a poker player puts a heavy strain on his bankroll. That much is obvious. But what are less obvious are the systematic effects of that strain on your poker game.

Having a low bankroll, clearly, makes it more likely you grow broke. But chances are, you're not too afraid of that, and perhaps you're convinced you'll move down when that risk draws near (when it comes down to it, you might, you might not). Very few people who go broke ever suspect they're going to. But going broke isn't the only danger to a poker player. Much more dangerous are the effects that having a slim bankroll will have on your mentality while you're playing poker.

If you're playing with 30 buyins and have to move down if you lose 10, you're much more likely to feel like you need to win *this session*. You're more likely to feel that this day, hand, or play needs to go right. After all, if it doesn't, the stakes are high&mdash;you'll have to move down, and your mind recoils from that idea. So playing with a low bankroll will make you more likely to tilt, to feel desperate, and to constantly be playing at the margins of safety. Your unconscious incentives will rock back and forth, like a boat in a storm. This problem is only compounded by, for example, having an impending cashout you're going to make at the end of the month, at which point you'll *definitely need to win*. This state of mind is clearly not a good place for a poker player to be playing from.

Cashouts are a part of poker. But if used thoughtfully, they can be a powerful tool to organize your progression. Instead of cashing out a usual amount every month, why not instead use your cashouts strategically? Allow yourself special cashout bonuses when you hit certain goals, like a certain number of hands per month, or not tilting for 10 days straight. Ideally, put your cashout money to experiences you want to have, rather than toward unnecessary material goods; experiences are better motivators, and according to behavioral science, are more likely to make you happy. Used properly, cashouts are one of our most powerful incentives as poker players. If you just cashout the same amount every month no matter what, you're simply throwing away a powerful source of motivation and direction.

If you are up-and-coming in poker, it is vitally important that you limit your spending. Allow your poker bankroll to grow and flourish; give yourself the chance to move up; let your sprouting poker game grow into a healthy tree. If you live minimally (but well), use cashouts to motivate yourself, and give your bankroll as much breathing room as possible, you will become a better and more focused of a poker player, and you'll move up much faster.

Ultimately, once your relationship with money is habitualized, it becomes much harder to change it. For my own part, this is something I've had to work to repair over time. And now, trying to live with $10,000, money has much more weight than it used to. The anxiety of spending $20 on dinner is something that, before, I couldn't even imagine. Now, it's a fact of life. But in time, I'm going to figure out a healthy way to relate to money. For me, as for anyone, that just comes with time and thoughtful effort.

Money can be a great mental burden, and to many people, it is. But the goal, in my mind, is to find the middle way. There are those who worship money, and those who fear it. But those who respect money are, I think, the most happy&mdash;and the most free.

*What's the secret to playing pocket jacks?*

This is probably one of the most common questions in poker, and yet no one seems to have come up with a satisfactory answer to the question. Here, I'm going to examine why that is, and give you my own take on the answer.

I was in a coffeeshop a few weeks ago browsing the internet, when I came across [this article](http://www.csun.edu/~dgw61315/thetwothings.html) by Glen Whitman called &ldquo;The Two Things.&rdquo; In it, he recounts the story of the Two Things.

> A few years ago, I was chatting with a stranger in a bar. When I told him I was an economist, he said, &ldquo;Ah. So… what are the Two Things about economics?&rdquo;
>
> &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; I cleverly replied.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qt-nxXlsjTs">[video]</div>

> &ldquo;You know, the Two Things. For every subject, there are really only two things you really need to know. Everything else is the application of those two things, or just not important.&rdquo;
>
> &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Okay, here are the Two Things about economics. One: Incentives matter. Two: There's no such thing as a free lunch.&rdquo;
>
> Ever since that evening, I've been playing the Two Things game. Whenever I meet someone who belongs to a different profession (i.e., a profession I haven't played this game with), or who knows something about a subject I'm unfamiliar with, I pose the Two Things question.

He then goes on to compile some interesting &ldquo;Two Things&rdquo; that people have come up with about their respective fields. Many of them were poignant, insightful, and a few of them were quite amusing.

> The Two Things about English Literature:
>  1. The text is really about writing.
>  2. Writing is really about sex.
> *-Marya*
>
> The Two Things about World Conquest:
>  1. Divide and Conquer.
>  2. Never invade Russia in the winter.
> *-Tim Lee*

So I thought to myself&mdash;well, I'm supposed to be an expert on poker. What are its Two Things? To work well, they're supposed to be two principles of thought from which you could potentially derive all of poker theory. Every piece of strategy should boil down to these two principles. I thought about it for some time, and decided, if I were to try to simplify all of poker play and theory into two principles, it'd be these:

> **The Two Things about Poker:**
>
> 1. Every piece of information narrows down handranges
>
> 2. People are bad at being random

You could surely invent other &ldquo;Two Things&rdquo; about more specific subjects such as live poker, tournaments, heads up, variance etc. This was just my first take on it. If any of you guys have ideas as to what you think are the Two Things about poker, leave a comment&mdash;I'd love to read them.

Until next time,

Today, I've got a special treat: I recorded a preview of the audiobook! Hear a great section from the book, &ldquo;Tilt: the Customer is Always Right,&rdquo; which teaches how to play optimally against a tilting player.

Of course, you also get to enjoy my chocolatey voice in its full aural deliciousness. It's okay, it's not weird that you like it. It just makes you more of a man.


<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xNAKaXUDfBU">[video]</div>

Hope you enjoyed! The audiobook should be released soon; I'll be working through the recording this weekend. Look forward to it, and be sure to pick it up once it comes out–you know, so I'm not wearing out my voice for nothing.

Lately, I've been thinking about the infamous &ldquo;million dollar bet&rdquo; I made back in 2011. Today, I thought I'd repost the original story on this blog so it's all here in one place. I was originally planning to rewrite it, but I've decided instead that I should post the whole thing unedited. It was very raw when I wrote it, and that rawness comes through in the writing. It's an intense story&mdash;just reading it takes me back.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FuB00XfRNjo">[video]</div>

## Part One

I'm writing this sitting in my car at a rest stop somewhere in the panhandle of Florida. I am reclining in my chair trying to get comfortable, but I can't. I have all my stuff packed into the trunk and back seat. Rain is pelting the windshield, casting speckled shadows on my hands. I'm tired but I can't sleep. I don't know what time it is. Maybe 11, maybe midnight. I haven't been able to sleep well lately. The last few days have been tough.

I wasn't sure how to write about this. I wasn't sure what kind of a story there was to tell, or who really I would be writing a story for. Ultimately I just know that I need to express what I'm feeling and what I've gone through.

I suppose everything began last year. I took a long break from the game; I was away from poker for about 9 months after I got hacked. I was focusing on my own life&mdash;on getting healthy in both mind and body, and I was keeping my distance from the world of poker. I would attempt a few times to get my head back into the game, but it just wouldn't stick. I just didn't have that same drive to keep playing the game.

<div class="center">♠</div>

When I went to Vegas for the first time when I was 20 (July 2010), I met a lot of poker players I'd only known online, and one of those players was Jungleman. I found he and I had a lot of perspectives in common and he really admired me. We spent a lot of time hanging out and decided that we might live together at some point later in the year. We settled on going to San Diego around October, and we invited Ashton who we both knew to come live with us. He was going to school and wrestling at the time so he couldn't leave Orlando, but he ended up offering us to both come down to Orlando and live with him. It seemed like a good idea, since all three of us were strong poker players and we were all young.

So we did. Jungleman and I came to Orlando. The three of us spent a lot of time together&mdash;playing poker, feeling out the city, being young and stupid. For me this experience was a great opportunity since it was a chance for me to get my head back into the game, to focus, study poker, and to learn from these two really great players. It helped to re-ignite my passion for the game and also get my poker game back on track. I was a lot more mature than the two of them. Both Ashton and Jungle respected me. They would call me the &ldquo;papa bear&rdquo; of the house. I looked after them.

It was an interesting relationship between the three of us. But, well, I suppose the real story starts a few days ago.

<div class="center">♠</div>

Doug, a.k.a. WCGRider, had come to spend a week with us in Orlando. Jungle was supposed to be back from Australia on the 4th, but he ended up getting delayed so he wouldn't be back after Doug was gone. So it was just me, Ashton, and Doug.

Ashton had decided to buy some tickets to the Magic-Heat game on Thursday night. He offered me a ticket to the game, but I passed. I didn't feel like going. He ended up taking Doug as well as some other friends.

It was rowdy, they did a lot of drinking, and after the game they went to House of Blues for a concert. Doug later recounted the story to me: he went up to the bar at House of Blues to buy some drinks. Ashton came up to him and said &ldquo;Hey, don't worry about it man, I'll get the drinks, it's fine.&rdquo;

Doug said, &ldquo;Nah , don't worry about it. You already bought the tickets, I got the drinks man.&rdquo;

Ashton replied &ldquo;Well, thanks…  …You know… I feel sad all the time.&rdquo;

Doug looked at him.

&ldquo;I feel anxious and depressed, and I haven't been happy in a long time.&rdquo; Doug listened with a seriousness amidst this concert at the House of Blues.

&ldquo;Well man, if you want help, all of us are here and are willing to help you.&rdquo;

He continued, &ldquo;If you want to get your shit together, you need to stop all the prop-betting, you need to stop all the craziness, you need to just focus on poker, on school, and on your health man. And you can do it. We all know you can.&rdquo;

Ashton smiled at him. &ldquo;Yeah, you're right. I can do it. I can change.&rdquo; And then the night went on. Ashton ended up leaving with a girl around 3AM. Doug and Ashton's sister who had also gone to the concert ended up driving back to the house by themselves.

<div class="center">♠</div>

Now, I was having trouble sleeping that night. I'm usually the first person awake, but I'd gotten up especially early that morning and ate breakfast. At about 11 I came into the living room and saw Doug sitting on the couch playing poker, and Ashton sitting at his computer. Ashton had only gotten home five or six hours ago, and had slept maybe four hours. He'd drunk quite a lot the previous night. He was on Skype with Justin Smith.

Doug and I watched as Ashton asked him to set up a prop bet with him. The very next morning, after four hours of sleep, Ashton was trying to set up a prop bet with Justin as to whether or not he could run 70 miles in a day. Justin was hesitant to accept&mdash;the more Justin hesitated, the higher Ashton raised the odds.

&ldquo;1-1.&rdquo;

&ldquo;No, no, no…&rdquo; Justin replied.

&ldquo;Okay, 2-1&rdquo;

&ldquo;No…&rdquo;

&ldquo;Okay, 3-1… 3.5-1, because you're my friend.&rdquo;

As this went on, Doug and I exchanged looks as if to say&mdash;is he really doing this? Ashton looked at me and said &ldquo;Haseeb, 3-1 sounds fair right? You'd take this bet at 3-1?&rdquo;

I looked at him incredulously, glanced at Doug, and replied &ldquo;Uh yeah, 3-1 sounds fair.&rdquo;

Ashton turned back to his PC and finally said, &ldquo;alright man, I just really want to do this run… 5.5-1.&rdquo;


Justin simply said, &ldquo;I'm going to sleep&rdquo; and hung up. Ashton was visibly frustrated.

He then turned to me and said &ldquo;Alright, you're booking that right?&rdquo; And I said &ldquo;Well dude, I'm not sure that's such a great idea.&rdquo;

&ldquo;No man, I'm going to do this. I can do 70 miles no problem. I know my body.&rdquo; We discussed it and asked what's the most he'd ever run before. He told us that the most he'd ever run in one stretch was twenty-two miles. Ashton is very athletic; he's a collegiate-level wrestler, he ran cross-country in high school, and he'd run 13 miles just a couple of days prior. He's extremely fit. But he'd never even run a complete marathon in his life. He looked at me and said, &ldquo;What's the most you can do?&rdquo; I considered this for a minute.

As I was looking at him I thought to myself…I've been in this situation before. I've seen Ashton make lots of silly prop bets. I've seen him get scammed, burned, taken advantage of countless times, and I've also seen him offer a lot of silly prop bets that weren't in his favor. Every time I've refrained from taking part; refrained from having anything to do with it. I know that he fucks up a lot, and I know that he's a degenerate sometimes. I've known Ashton for years and I've watched him travel down his road. Many times along the way I've tried to stop him, to advise him, to pull him out of harm's way, but ultimately he finds himself there again and again.

I had come to realize that I can't stop Ashton from doing these things. I knew that no matter what I said or did, he was determined to do this prop bet. I know him, I know the frustration and anxiety he's been feeling, and I know the look in his eyes and the resolve in his voice. I thought there was no way that he could run 70 miles. The way I saw it, he was ready to grab a handful of his money and throw it into the wind. I can't save him. I can't stop him.

I replied, &ldquo;Alright, I can do 70. 70k for your 210.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Alright, it's booked,&rdquo; he replied. He finished eating his Dunkin' Donuts and ran upstairs to change into his shorts. It was around noon then. We set up the terms of the bet&mdash;he was given a span of 24 hours to complete the run. He had to maintain a running speed at all times on the treadmill&mdash;any walking or anything below that given speed would not count toward his total. He was free to take as many breaks as he needed. Doug up took a small piece as did another friend, but most of the action was mine.

He scurried off with a spring in his step to the nearby gym to start his running. And so at 12:30 PM on Friday the 4th of February, the bet began.

<div class="center">♠</div>

Doug and I began making phone calls. Anyone and everyone we knew who was knowledgeable about running, who had run marathons, who knew anyone who had run marathons. We asked people if they thought it was possible&mdash;some guy who's a collegiate wrestler who used to run cross country in high school, who had never run a complete marathon in his life. The overwhelming consensus that I got was that his chance to win was low, and some pegged it at close to 0%. Everyone who I asked about it was skeptical, and once I told them that he wasn't allowed to walk, I was told it would be close to impossible for somebody without any training in supermarathon running. To top it off… I hadn't mentioned to anyone that he'd been drinking the previous night and had gotten four hours sleep, or that he was offering me 3-1 on the bet.

At that point I thought that if all these people think Ashton can't do it, then there's no way he can win. He thinks he knows his body, but you can't know how your body would respond to that level of physical and psychological stress if you've never been there. He can't know. He can't know what three back-to-back marathons would do to his calves, to his knees, or to his heart. He still had alcohol in his system and had gotten almost no sleep, and I knew that he was feeling anxious. I figured this is Ashton standing in front of the railroad tracks again&mdash;this is him sitting at 500/1k heads up against Phil Ivey with his roll, desperate to have something change, for something to rile him up, to feel alive and meaningful again. He wanted to make himself the hero. The way I saw it, there was no way that Ashton could do this.

<div class="center">♠</div>

Doug and I went back and forth from the apartment complex gym where he was running. We brought him Gatorade, power bars, water bottles, and checked up on him to make sure he was alright and watched his progress. His sister decided to spend the day with us (after learning what he was doing), and helped us out ferrying food and drink back and forth. We watched him, kept track of time, and measured up his progress. At that point, it still seemed like just a frivolous spur-of-the-moment bet. I figured that my role was to make sure that Ashton was going to be okay once he got through to the other side&mdash;that after he gave up or lost the bet, that he'd be able to get his mind back together and get back on his feet. I knew it'd be hard on him when he lost.

Around 2PM Doug and I went to Ruby Tuesday's to get lunch. While we were eating, we got a text from Ashton saying that he was looking for more action, and that he was going to find other people to buy it up so he could put up 900k of his own money. I remember when he read that text aloud to me, Doug looked at me dumbfounded. We had no idea how to take it. The first thought that came to our minds was that Ashton was self-destructing. That he was putting it all on the line, and wanted all-or-nothing. I remember thinking that the sweat-drenched Ashton, in that musky little gym probably felt happier and more alive running on that treadmill than he had in some time. He had meaning in that moment. He must've felt that every pound of his muscle, every strain of his body had a meaning and clear direction behind it. He knew exactly what he was fighting for, what he was hurting for.

So I texted him, &ldquo;alright, I'll buy up the rest.&rdquo; He texted back, &ldquo;Are you sure about this?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah, I'm sure. My 285k plus the other 15k you have booked makes 300k. Consider it booked.&rdquo;

I thought to myself, he's giving money away. He's not going to stop until he sells off all of that action and puts up 900k of his own money. If I know he's going to throw 600k into the wind, what difference would it make if it were my hand that caught it instead of somebody else's? I mean, that's what poker players do isn't it? They make their plays where the money is. They don't hold grudges. We're just two poker players, playing a game. Whoever wins just made the right decision in that moment, and the loser understands that. It's not personal. Poker isn't personal. Well, it's not supposed to be, anyway.

As we drove back to the apartment complex, Doug and I were reflecting on how bizarre and fucked up the whole situation was. This was the most money I'd ever put on anything like this&mdash;I'm not a prop bettor, and the most I've ever bet on something was less than $1,000. It just felt surreal. Just talking about it made it start to feel more and more incredible (in the literal sense of the word). Doug said to me &ldquo;Well you have to admit, either way, Ashton is a fucking animal.&rdquo;

I replied, &ldquo;Well, that's true, but we're not betting on whether or not Ashton is an animal. We're betting on whether he can run these 70 miles today.&rdquo;

<div class="center">♠</div>

Once we returned, I caught up with Ashton on his way back to the gym and we spoke briefly. He asked me if I was sure I wanted to do this, and I told him I was. He said to me, &ldquo;Why? Do you think that I can't do this? Do you think I don't know my body?&rdquo;

I chose my words carefully. &ldquo;I…I just think the odds are too good man. I can't pass up this bet.&rdquo;

He said, &ldquo;Okay, then if you want to take this action there are two terms you have to agree to. The first is that you think there's a 0% chance that I would cheat. That doesn't mean you think there's a 1% chance that I'd cheat and you'll live with it, but you have to literally think there's a 0% chance I'd cheat you.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Yeah, I know you're not going to cheat. Don't worry.&rdquo;

He continued, &ldquo;Alright. The second term is that… this doesn't affect our friendship, even if I win. Or if I lose. We're still friends.&rdquo;

I studied him, thought for a moment and said, &ldquo;Well, if you lose, are you still going to be friends with me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, if I lose I'm not going to hate you. So it's fine, we'll still be friends.&rdquo; I patted him on the back, and then we shook hands. Thinking back, it didn't feel like a million dollar handshake. Actually, I'm not sure what that would feel like, haha. I suppose it still didn't feel real. I just figured I'd regret it if instead of me some random poker player out there was 600k richer tomorrow. I kept making what I thought was the right move, but it would take me a while to process the gravity of what I had agreed to.

<div class="center">♠</div>

Ashton returned to the treadmill and started running again. It was 2PM then, and my anxiety was starting to build. I remember telling Doug, &ldquo;You know, for 70k I could almost be zen about it. Losing 70k would suck, but I'd be alright. I could still focus on other things. But 285k man… the difference between winning and losing… -285k or +855k. This is a million dollar bet. I didn't realize this, but I'm not going to be able to play poker today man. Hell, I'm not going to be able to think about anything else…&rdquo; He told me, &ldquo;of course, what did you expect? You've got one hell of a sweat ahead of you man.&rdquo;

Time dragged by slowly. Doug and Ashton's sister continually updated me on his progress every half-hour, and I passed the time calculating Ashton's progress and mileage rate. I spent a lot of the time talking to friends and trying to keep myself grounded. I spoke to a friend of mine (who isn't a poker player) about the bet and he asked me, &ldquo;So what are you going to do when you win your 850k?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Well, I don't know if I'm going to win yet. I could lose. But if I do win, I'm probably just going to buy a car and put the rest away.&rdquo; He chuckled. &ldquo;What, like a hundred thousand dollar car?&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;Nah, probably more like a 30k car.&rdquo; He knows me, and I'm not a flashy person when it comes to money&mdash;I live pretty simply, and I prefer it that way. He said to me, &ldquo;Ah, man. Money is wasted on the rich.&rdquo; I laughed.

<div class="center">♠</div>

Ashton returned to the house several times, complaining that he felt tired a lot sooner than he expected. Around 4PM he curled up on the couch and announced to us that he was going to sleep for a bit. He didn't sleep, and ten minutes later he got up and went back out to run again. At 6PM he returned and announced that he was going to sleep for a few hours in his room. He stayed in his room for ten minutes, told us that he felt energized already, and then was out the door again. Ashton was completely unable to sleep. Doug and I figured that was definitive&mdash;he wouldn't be able to win. Without rest, his body wouldn't hold up.

At around 8PM, I spoke to a friend of mine who had some experience in running marathons. I told her the entire story, about how Ashton was feeling out of it, how he was unable to sleep, and that he'd been drinking heavily the night before. She told me with an unexpected graveness&mdash;&rdquo;You guys need to be watching him constantly.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;Well, we're checking up on him every half hour or so, bringing him food and drink and stuff.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no, you guys need to be there in case something happens. If he collapses or gets a heart attack, he'll need immediate medical attention. Somebody needs to be there. Like, right now. The likelihood will only go up the longer that kid runs.&rdquo;

Slowly, the realization settled in. I know Ashton, and I know how much heart he has. He's a beast. He'll keep pushing and pushing until the brink of his physical limits. The question was never whether Ashton had the force of will to win this bet, but whether or not his body could withstand it. In reality, I knew that Ashton wouldn't give up. The bet I was making was that Ashton would be physically incapable of going any further. I was betting that Ashton would either: pull a muscle and be unable to run, collapse from exhaustion, damage his joints, or have a heart attack. There was no other way that he would lose.

From that point, Doug and I agreed to watch him constantly, but before we could commit to a vigil Ashton had returned home around 9:30 PM. He said that he was going to sleep again, and this time he was in his room for a while. Doug and I waited around along with Ashton's sister in the living room downstairs. It all felt uneasy. Ashton's sister asked, &ldquo;Do you guys think he's sleeping?&rdquo;

Doug told us that he'd seen Ashton earlier when he stepped in to use the bathroom. He said that Ashton was sitting on his bed, just rocking quietly back and forth. &ldquo;There's no way he'll be able to sleep,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When I did my prop bet, I had to do something like that. It was different, but just like Ashton I had a time constraint and a lot of pressure. I remember I would play and play for hours during the day, and then when I realized I was tired I'd crawl into bed. But when I got into bed, I would stare up at the ceiling and all I could think about was the playing that I could be doing, and I would think about the fact that I wasn't sleeping, and I would get scared that instead of lying here staring at the ceiling I could be playing more hands, and then I'd get up and go try to play again… and when I realized I was too sleepy, I'd go back to bed and try again. The sleep was the hardest part. It's impossible to sleep when you're scared and the adrenaline is rushing. Trust me, Ashton won't be able to sleep.&rdquo;

Ashton's sister asked if there was anything she could do to help him sleep. He shook his head. The story seemed to be getting more and more fucked up the longer it went on. I wasn't expecting any of this. Ashton was going through something truly horrible. Rocking back and forth in that bedroom… all the fear and confusion he must've been feeling… us sitting downstairs waiting for our friend to give in. He was falling behind pace to win the bet. I was supposed to be relieved, but I felt miserable. The entire thing started to feel perverse.

<div class="center">♠</div>

Around 10:30PM his sister told us that Ashton's parents were on their way up here from Ft. Lauderdale, 3 hours away. Doug and I had no idea what to think. According to his sister, he had called his mother and simply told her &ldquo;You need to come up here. I need your help.&rdquo; His sister had tried to get them to turn around, but they were insistent on driving up. This whole affair started to feel more and more like it was spiraling out of control, and we were now going to have to explain to his parents the whole situation. Doug was taken aback, but I was prepared to tell his parents everything.

It was almost 11:00PM and Ashton was still in his bedroom. He had completed 30 miles of the 70. Midnight would be the halfway point in the bet, and it seemed that he still had not gotten a wink of sleep. At this point, I was positive that the bet was over. Ashton had simply underestimated his own exhaustion. He had not even reached half of the mileage&mdash;and the first marathon would be the easiest. There was no way he could run the second and third marathons at a faster pace. I thought my role would be to explain to his parents what all had happened and why. I thought it was over.

Half an hour later, his parents arrived and went straight upstairs to Ashton's room. Doug and I sat in the living room wringing our hands, unsure of what was going to happen. We spoke to each other in quieted voices, almost rehearsing how we were going to explain it to them. Finally, we saw them descending the stairs and taking notice of us in the living room. His mother smiled at me warmly, offered her hand and said &ldquo;Hi, I'm Julia.&rdquo; I introduced myself, and she walked toward the kitchen to set down her purse. &ldquo;I can't believe what Ashton's doing,&rdquo; she said perhaps to herself, &ldquo;I can't believe how reckless he's being… but most of all I can't believe the people who are making Ashton do this.&rdquo;

Doug and I looked at each other. She didn't realize that we were the ones he was betting against. I stepped into the entranceway of the kitchen as she leaned back against a countertop, and announced to her, &ldquo;well actually Julia. We're some of the people who bet against Ashton. Not only us. We and several others.&rdquo;

The moment she heard me say that, she broke eye contact and tightened her shoulders. Her demeanor changed entirely. She bit her lip as I started to tell the story, from the very beginning… not omitting any details… about how I knew her son, about our relationship, about how the bet began, about what had happened thus far… about how much money was at stake… about the risks he was taking…, and I remember telling her &ldquo;Ultimately, Ashton called you two here for a reason. He wanted you two to see something. What that is, I can't say, but all I know is that you two need to listen to what he's trying to tell you.&rdquo; I remember feeling confident in my words.

&ldquo;You say you're his friend Haseeb?&rdquo; From then on, she didn't speak to me… she spoke AT me. She didn't look me in the eye again. &ldquo;No, real friends wouldn't put their friends health at risk to try to take his money. You knew exactly what it meant when you bet against Ashton. You're not his friends.&rdquo;

We protested. No, I said, he was going to do this anyway. I couldn't stop him. He was going to do it anyway. I was helping him wasn't I? I was worried about him wasn't I? I was watching over him wasn't I? What difference did it make whether it was my money or someone else's?

&ldquo;No Haseeb, you two aren't his friends. It's all about money isn't it? That's what you guys want right? That's what you're here for, that's why you're making my son do this?&rdquo;

No, no. No…

&ldquo;Right, well your actions say otherwise. Well, Ashton isn't going to do this,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I'm not going to let risk my son's health so that you two can get your payday. He's not going to do this bet.&rdquo;

Well… that's not your call.

&ldquo;No, it is my call. I said he's not going to do this. There's no amount of money that's worth risking his health for, and if you were his friends you would know that. You two can find me and come to me personally and… I'll figure out how to pay you. But this bet is over. You guys will get your money.&rdquo;

Doug and I looked at each other. I didn't know what to say. She looked at me like I was a complete piece of shit. The parents went back upstairs to check on Ashton again, leaving Doug and I standing in the kitchen. I walked to the living room and sank into the couch.

I knew that as his parents, they were bound to feel that way. There was no other perspective they could have, really… I could see why they would think that we were just scum. I had seen Ashton cheated, ripped off, taken advantage of by countless people before. It would make sense that not knowing the situation, she'd think of me as just another one of those people. Of course she would. But I couldn't shake what they said. It stuck with me, and slowly gnawed at my mind. The memory feels raw. I still remember it.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JDZaiM8oAOU">[video]</div>

## Part Two

I've arrived safely in Austin at my parents' house. My car parked on the street and is still packed with all my stuff. It's been a while since I've spent the night here. I'm sleeping in the guest room, since the bed in my old bedroom is too small for me now. There was a big storm here last night. I woke up a couple times in the middle of the night to hail pounding the roof and windows creaking. It's still cloudy this morning, but the weather has calmed. I have forgotten how quiet this place can be.

Earlier today I read some of the comments on the first part of my blog. I wasn't surprised at the assortment of awe, compassion, and indignation. But ultimately, this story isn't about other people, and it's not something I wrote to be gawked at or as a testimony for others to pass judgment upon, although I have no qualms if they do so. I have thought about these events a lot in the last few days that I've been driving on the road back to Austin. They say silence is fertilizer for the soul. When you're alone only with your thoughts, all you can really think about is the things you've done, about where your life is going, and who you are.

I wrote this story because I think it's an important story to tell, for myself and for others to learn from. Writing this isn't about making myself feel better, or to try to justify anything that happened. It's about owning who I am and how I feel about what happened that day. The rest, as they say, is history.

<div class="center">♠</div>

The parents had gone upstairs to check up on Ashton again, and Doug and I were slinked on the couch downstairs. At that point, we were only waiting. For what, we didn't know. Ashton's mother had declared to us that the bet was over, but we knew that Ashton wasn't going to simply concede. We knew he was going to fight and insist that he could go on and pull it off. The time was almost 11:45, and he was still less than halfway through the distance. I thought the bet was over and we were going to deal with the aftermath. I remember sitting there on that couch and just feeling guilty and uncertain. We waited.

Finally around 12, Ashton's sister (who had defended us to his parents) came downstairs. She told us they were trying to talk to him, but Ashton wasn't saying much…all he said was he wanted pasta. She asked if either of us knew how to cook spaghetti. Doug and I looked at each other. &ldquo;You do know we're poker players right?&rdquo; She shook her head at us, and we laughed.

I went into the kitchen with her and poked around getting a pot ready for boiling spaghetti, and she gave me instructions while she returned upstairs into Ashton's room with the rest of her family. So I stood over the stove and watched the spaghetti. I remember asking Doug as I was standing over the stove, &ldquo;Do you think I just came across to his parents as a total prick? I don't understand it. I mean I look out for Ashton don't I? I'm his friend aren't I? They were talking to me like I'm a slimy piece of shit. He was going to do this anyway, I know I couldn't stop him…I don't have control over him. I can't help someone who doesn't want my help.&rdquo;

He told me thoughtfully, &ldquo;Well man…I think you're right. And I think they're right too. The answer probably lies somewhere in the middle, really. I don't think you did anything wrong. I don't think Ashton thinks you did anything wrong. And if I were his parents and I saw this whole mess, I'd probably react the same way.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I know man, I know. I would too if I were his parents. But I just can't shake this feeling. I feel like shit about this whole thing.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Well, we're in it now. We just gotta deal with it,&rdquo; he told me. The spaghetti softened slowly, and sunk to the bottom of the pot.

<div class="center">♠</div>

Ashton finally came downstairs. He was wearing sweatpants and a black hoodie with the hood over his head. I asked him how he was doing, how his legs and knees felt. Fine, he said. We didn't ask him about whether he was going to continue the bet. The way he walked in and was searching for food, we knew he was going to keep running. He didn't seem unnerved… he just wanted pasta. It was almost scary how comfortable he seemed. His sister poured him a bowl of spaghetti, and he sat down at his computer desk to start eating.

As he ate, he pulled up some music on Youtube. It was a dubstep track. &ldquo;Have you guys heard this song?&rdquo; We told him we hadn't. &ldquo;Oh my god, it's so good.&rdquo; He started playing the music for us on the computer speakers as he ate. He bobbed his head to the beat, and soon started to air-drum on the desk. He ate his spaghetti that way, jamming to music he wanted to share with us. He still saw us as his friends, and in his silly way Ashton was still okay.

I remember looking at him carefully. I didn't dare to take my eyes away. The occupied expression on his face as he was clicking around on his computer, slurping that spaghetti. The bold white lettering on the hood of his hoodie, &ldquo;TO WRITE LOVE ON HER ARMS.&rdquo; The silence that we didn't dare interrupt, as though we were just waiting for him to speak again. A tired boy in a hood eating spaghetti at his desk. I remember thinking to myself very clearly: remember this sight, Haseeb. You will never forget this as long as you live. I said nothing. I just watched him. He ate slowly and unhurried.

<div class="center">♠</div>

When he finally finished eating, he talked to us some more as he sat there digesting. Joking and laughing…he barely even acknowledged the insanity of the situation he was in. I remember thinking, how can he be so energetic right now? He seems happy. Is he happy right now? I said very little.

At around 12:30, he went back upstairs. When he came down, he had changed into his shorts and marched out the door once again, his parents following quickly behind him. They hadn't said another word to us after our previous exchange. In the end, I thought to myself, they couldn't stop him either.

So the bet went on into the night.

<div class="center">♠</div>

Doug had been coming down with a cold all that day, and his cough was getting noticeably bad. I told him that he should get some sleep and drink lots of liquids. There was no point in him staying up if the parents are going to be watching Ashton all night. I'll make sure everything's all right, I told him. He agreed and went upstairs to get some much-needed sleep. I was sleepy too; I hadn't gotten much sleep the previous night and my exhaustion was building, but I felt like I needed to stay awake.

Ashton's sister and her boyfriend were in the living room with me. I told the sister, &ldquo;I just wanted to tell you, I'm really grateful that you guys are here. I don't know how we could've handled all this if you guys weren't helping us out.&rdquo; She smiled and said not to worry about it. She and her boyfriend just laughed and said it was typical for their family.

They weren't phased at all. They were giggling at each other's jokes and pulling up clips on Youtube… they seemed so comfortable in the midst of all of this madness, just living and making the most of things. I realized that I admired them. I remember telling Doug before he took his Nyquil and went to bed, &ldquo;Man… thank god for normal people.&rdquo; He grinned and agreed. &ldquo;Fuck the poker world,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;We need to learn to be more like them.&rdquo; Doug went upstairs to sleep and the two of them ended up falling asleep together under a blanket on the couch.

<div class="center">♠</div>

At around 1:30AM, I realized I was so exhausted that I needed to get some sleep. I went to my bedroom and set my alarm for 2:45AM, deciding that I was going to get up and sweat Ashton for the rest of run. I was just too tired, I could barely keep my eyes open and my mind just felt racked with exhaustion. It all felt like too much. I remember staring blankly at the ceiling. I wanted to push my anxiety down and just sink into the covers. It took me a while to fall asleep.

<div class="center">♠</div>

I scrambled to my feet and checked my phone. It was almost 5AM; I had missed my alarm. I must've been too tired and slept through it. Fuck, fuck. I threw my clothes on, shoved my feet into my shoes, and ran out the door toward the gym. I realized I had to piss along the way, so I went into a corner behind some hedges and relieved myself. It made me feel surprisingly relaxed…I felt like I'd be ready to face the scene before me. I walked around the side of the building, entered in the passcode to the gym, and opened the door.

His mother was sitting on the recumbent bike, tinkering with a game on her phone. His stepdad was standing near Ashton, his arm resting on an adjacent treadmill. He was watching a cartoon on the TV's that were suspended over the wall. Neither of them looked at me or even acknowledged my presence. I said nothing.

I walked over to the far side of the gym, and sat myself down on a weightlifting bench. I checked the time on my phone&mdash;it was 5:15 AM. I decided to myself I would stay the rest of the time and just watch him. I thought I would be able to.

I sat there blankly for some time as he was running, just feeling my brain slowly process everything. All I could hear was the mechanical whirr of the treadmill, and the pounding as his feet hit the tread. It was so perfect and continuous, like a metronome. I studied him carefully. He was stripped down only to his boxers. His skin seemed to be stretched taut over his musculature. His face was looking down and toward the left as he ran…his gait almost seemed like he was scurrying to catch up with the treadmill. His eyes were blank. I didn't know what he was looking at or thinking about. I remember thinking that he looked pitiful. Like a caged animal. I knew it was all in my head, but the longer I looked at him, the more my heart sunk. I felt so enormously guilty in that moment, I couldn't even look at him.

I pulled my iPod out of my pocket and put on my headphones. I thought maybe that would calm me down. I played some soft, mellow music. I looked at my shoes as I listened. I could still hear the whirring treadmill, the pounding of his feet over my music. I looked up at him, feeling a little more steady. I watched his legs as he ran… they seemed so stiff and tightened. I remember my gaze settling on his knees… I watched them carefully. They swayed back and forth, like fleshy pendulums. The longer I watched his knees… the more I started to see little glimpses in my mind of his legs slipping, of his pace slowing down, of his knees creaking to a stop. The image of his legs slowing down would persist for a moment, and then those pendulums would come back. And then I would see him tripping and falling on his stomach… and then the pendulums would come back. My heart started to beat faster. I was getting more and more anxious, and I could feel my stomach tensing up as I saw Ashton losing the bet again, and again, and again. Yet every time, those pendulums would come back. No matter what I felt, he kept running. I closed my eyes. Everything felt heavy in that moment. It was overwhelming.

I got to my feet. I felt like I was going to throw up. I hurried outside, slammed the &ldquo;Exit&rdquo; button to unlock the door, and stood over a hedge in the cold air. I had been in there only twenty minutes, but I couldn't take it. It was like I was face to face with my own insanity. The anxiety was too much.

I realized that I was imagining my friend truly getting hurt. It wasn't just an intellectual transaction anymore. I saw it with my very eyes. I thought to myself… What kind of a piece of shit am I that I'm thinking like this? What the fuck is wrong with me?

I walked back to the apartment, just trying to slow down my breathing, trying to settle down my flurried mind.

<div class="center">♠</div>

I called my friend, who woke up in the middle of the night to take my call. I was frantic, &ldquo;Fuck, I can't watch them. I can't. I'm going fucking crazy with anxiety just being in that room. I can't handle it.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Hey, hey. Haseeb. It's okay,&rdquo; she told me. &ldquo;Listen to me, it's okay. You don't need to be in that room. You need to just worry about you right now ok? Ashton's parents are in there worrying about him, he'll be fine. Focus on yourself. Just calm down, just breathe.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Fuck, fuck Rachel. What if he has a heart attack? What if he goes to the emergency room? How am I going to even know? His parents aren't going to tell me. I was sitting there on that fucking bench, imagining him falling over… what kind of a person does that make me? What kind of fucked up person am I that I'm imagining him getting hurt? What's wrong with me?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Listen, Haseeb. Nothing's wrong with you okay. This whole thing is just mad. He's a madman, and he's brought you into a mad situation, and it's making you go mad too. Nothing is wrong with you. Calm down, okay?&rdquo;

&ldquo;I don't know Rachel. I don't fucking know. It was like I was invisible in that room, his parents wouldn't even look at me. I feel like such a piece of shit. I wish I had never done any of this. I didn't think it'd ever turn out this way. I thought that it'd be over by now, that he'd have realized he couldn't do this. I didn't think I was doing anything wrong by taking this bet. I'm going to feel like a piece of shit even if I win, or if I lose. I don't know why I thought that I'd be okay with this.&rdquo;

Things went on that way for some time. Talking to her calmed me down some, but I still felt like there a riotous pain in my gut…something twisting and flopping around inside of my stomach, and it would climb up into my throat and choke me and then sink back down again. I felt like a wretch.

<div class="center">♠</div>

When I finally got off the phone with her I was less frantic, but the bet was still towering over me. The image of Ashton running in that gym kept seizing my thoughts. I tried to browse the internet and keep my mind occupied. It was 7AM. Time was slowing down to a crawl. He texted me his progress, and I measured it up&mdash;he had been running almost non-stop since midnight. At 78% of the time he had allotted, he had run 77% of the distance.

As time went on, I would feel more and more anxious. I had never felt an anxiety like that before in my life; it was suffocating. The longer I would be alone with my thoughts, the more it would possess me. I was looking at the clock twice every minute. Eventually I got so fucked up in the head, I had to call someone again. The cycle continued like that. Every moment I wasn't speaking to someone, it would start to feel like I was drowning in my own mind.

<div class="center">♠</div>

At around 8AM, I called someone who I hadn't spoken to about this bet before. Her name is Ursula. She's my best friend's mother. I met and got to know her over a week when she visited us about a year ago, but I had spoken to her only a couple times since. She is a small, skinny, worldly Polish woman who works as a healer. I remember my leg shaking uncontrollably, staring at her number in my phone. It was 6AM in Utah. My heart was beating. I felt guilty for calling her at this hour, but I dialed the number.

&ldquo;Hi? Who is this?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Ursula? Hi. It's Haseeb.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Oh… Haseeb… how are you sweetheart?&rdquo; she crooned in her slightly raspy voice. Even her voice sounded sagely to me. &ldquo;Are you ok?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Hey…hey…haha…well…no, I'm not okay,&rdquo; I sighed nervously. &ldquo;I got myself into something pretty crazy Ursula. I really fucked up bad and got myself into something I can't handle. I can't take being by myself right now. My thoughts are driving me crazy. I'm losing my mind, Ursula.&rdquo;

I proceeded to tell her all about the bet from the beginning. She murmured little yes's and oh my gosh's, and just followed along my story without interrupting me. I told her, &ldquo;I'm so sorry Ursula for waking you up. I'm so sorry, thank you so much for listening to me… I just really needed to tell someone all this.&rdquo;

She told me it was okay and tried to calm me down. She told me that I was one of the wisest and most mature young men she knew, and that she was surprised I had found myself in this situation. She told me that ultimately, this would be a great lesson in my life, and that Ashton would be an important teacher in my life as well, whether he knew it or not. &ldquo;What matters now most is whether you will learn the lesson that life is teaching you now, or if you need to be given this lesson again Haseeb. Ultimately, your challenge is going to be to see this through to the end, to acknowledge everything you're feeling, and then you must be able to forgive yourself. And once you can do that, and emerge from this without feeling like a victim, you'll be able to move on in your life, in your mind, and get back on the road you were meant to be on.&rdquo;

Then you must be able to forgive yourself. This phrase especially stuck with me. Even now, sitting here at my parents' home in Texas, it reverberates in my mind. I spent three days on the road alone in my car, wrestling with those words. I will never forget it.

I thanked her.

<div class="center">♠</div>

She had instructed me on a breathing exercise to do that would make me relax. I remember the mantra she told me to repeat:

&ldquo;I trust in the process of my life completely.&rdquo;

I had hung up the phone and was lying down on my bed trying to slow my breathing. Staring up at my ceiling, I calmly said aloud… &ldquo;I trust in the process of my life completely.&rdquo;

In that moment, some part of me became prepared to lose. I knew that I was supposed to lose the bet. That I was right to lose the bet. Because somewhere in all of this, there was a lesson that I needed to learn about myself, and about the world, and I had to accept that it was myself who brought me to this insane moment. 300k was going to hurt, a lot. When I made the bet originally, I realize that I wasn't really prepared mentally to lose 300k. I could handle it, I'd be okay&mdash;money can be made back. But ultimately money wasn't what really would affect me the most.

I thought about these things for a while. It was almost 9:00 AM. He had three hours left.

<div class="center">♠</div>

I woke up Doug, telling him that the bet was getting close to the end. Ashton's mileage had now pulled very slightly ahead of pace. It was going to be down to the wire whether he managed to finish. I told him I was losing my shit, and I just needed to talk to someone. He got his clothes on and we went to get some breakfast to calm our nerves.

As we were talking over breakfast, Ashton texted us. He had done 60 miles, and there were 3 hours left to go. He wrote &ldquo;I'm going to do 10 miles in 3 hours no problem. If you want to buy out now, you can for 200k. As a favor to you.&rdquo; Doug and I were surprised.

&ldquo;Man…there's no way I can take that buyout. To pay 85k to have a shot at a million dollars? I need less than 10% chance of winning to stay in. The last ten miles have to be the toughest. We knew that going in, that it would get exponentially more difficult the further he went on. Ashton has a point at which he can't run anymore, everyone does. He's never done this kind of endurance running before. The only question is whether his body will hit its limit at 69 miles or 71 miles. I can't take this buyout.&ldquo;

Doug agreed. We told him no. He asked if I was sure, if I really believed that this wasn't cake for him. I said I couldn't take that buyout. We didn't hear back from him.

Before we left the restaurant, I dropped $5 in a charity collection.

We drove home in silence.

<div class="center">♠</div>

By 10AM, Doug couldn't watch Ashton either. He said he couldn't handle it in there.

So we waited.

Time dragged slowly.

I was talking to people when I could to keep myself from exploding. But when I was telling my friends about what I was feeling, my tone had changed completely. I had felt like I had already lost. I felt like it was over. I was preparing myself. The number 285,000 would roll around in my head like a ball bearing.

Time was slow.

We waited.

<div class="center">♠</div>

It was almost noon, and we still hadn't heard from Ashton. I couldn't even contemplate anymore what was happening. My mind was starting to numb, and I just wanted it to be over with. I was ready to lose, and I didn't care anymore… I just wanted it to be over. The bet had begun at 12:30PM the previous day, and it was already 12:00PM. It was truly down to the wire.

I heard the door swing open.

I ran into the corridor at the head of the stairs. I didn't know what I expected to see. My heart felt like it was being held up by wire strings. In that first second that I saw the scene before me, I didn't understand.

Ashton was being helped up the stairs by his stepfather. He barely had the strength to pull his legs up. He was gripping onto the rail for support. &ldquo;Is he okay?&rdquo; They didn't answer me. In that moment, I didn't know.

When he finally got to the top of the stairs, he stepped into his room. He could walk. And then I knew.

It was over.

He had won.

<div class="center">♠</div>

I felt like I should be trying to help. It's not the time for me to worry about myself, I thought. I asked his mother how he was doing, what they were planning to do to help him recover, if they needed me to do anything. She told me that he was soaking in a tub of Epsom salt to help him recover. They said they were going to bring him food while he was soaking in there. He said he wanted pancakes. She was going to make him some.

I didn't know what to say. She told me then that they were going to take Ashton back to Ft. Lauderdale for a couple of days to let him recover. She said she would worry about him if he was here with us. It was then, the look that she gave me… as though I didn't belong there at all, that made it all start to sink into my skin. That's when it all started to hurt.

I asked again if they needed anything. She spoke to her husband. They ignored me.

I didn't know what to do anymore. I was exhausted. I went into my bedroom, texted a few people who were closely involved to tell them what happened, and sunk into my bed. I soon fell asleep.

<div class="center">♠</div>

The next couple of days were hard. I wasn't able to sleep well. I had strange dreams and would wake up after a couple hours. I dropped off Doug at the airport at 5AM the next morning, and from then on I was alone in the house. My mind felt heavy and sluggish.

I remember a friend of mine telling me &ldquo;Haseeb, this is going to fuck with your mind a lot. You've had a tough year, you walked away from poker after getting hacked, and now you put up all this money and lose what seems like an impossible bet. You're going to have a lot of digging to do, just to get your head in the right place again. That might be what sets you back the most, is just being able to believe in yourself again.&rdquo;

When I walked around the house, I could see the remnants of everything that happened. I saw bags on the floor full of used Gatorade bottles and power bars. Ashton's sweaty clothes still strewn across the floor. A half-open bottle of spaghetti sauce. When I saw that, for the first time it made me want to cry.

I decided I needed to leave. Ashton knew I had already planned to leave Orlando on the 14th, a week later. But I needed to leave now. I couldn't stay in that place anymore.

I didn't hate Ashton. I didn't blame him. Everything that I experienced, that I felt, and that I did fell squarely on my shoulders.

That afternoon, I started packing my things.

<div class="center">♠</div>

Everything that happened over those two days made me question a lot of things about my life and myself. I made the drive from Florida to Austin over three days, stopping only to eat, sleep, and write. Ultimately, like Ursula said, I need to understand what this tells me about who I really am. And then I need to be able to forgive myself for what I did.

I'd never lived with other poker players before. I've always been something of an outsider to the poker world&mdash;almost an interpreter you might say. I'd always been surrounded by normal people living their ordinary lives. Living with these guys has taught me a lot about myself, about who I want to really be, and how I want to live my life.

Something that I've come to think about is that perhaps there's something about the world of poker players that's fundamentally unhealthy. This generation of online poker players and its culture has existed for less than ten years, yet I've always had some assumption lodged deep in my psyche that if I'm not finding happiness through poker that it's just something wrong with me. And yet, there are so many people at every level of poker who are so deeply unhappy. It leaves me wondering.

And perhaps that's what really is the most difficult challenge for this generation of poker players. To infiltrate a world that is at its root, deeply unhealthy and imbalanced. To grab this bull called poker by its horns and to try to tame it for as long as we can. We hold on, and the bull bucks and tries to throw us into the droves of insanity around us. Some hold on, some don't. And maybe some are being dragged along the ground by this bull, and think they're still okay because they haven't let go. I remember writing over a year ago that as much as we learn about the game of poker, nobody really teaches us how to live as poker players. Nobody teaches us when we're supposed to let go of the bull.

In the end, I don't know the answers to any of these questions really. I've thought about a lot of things over the last few days and my mind is still scattered.

Losing 300k is painful. It will make me a little more anxious about money, but ultimately I'll be ok. I know that I need to put my mind and resolve back together so I can step back into the bullring. I'll have a lot of work to do to get back to the top of the game. My challenge now is to get myself back onto the head of this bull. And though I know it'll throw me off again someday, I know I have to ride it.

It's part of the process of my life.

<div class="center">♠</div>

As I was in the process of packing up my computer, to my surprise Ashton came through the door. He had already come back home the next day. I asked him how he was feeling, and he said he was feeling alright. His knees were hurting, but he was alright. He said he needed a shower. There was a Super Bowl party he wanted to go to that night.

&ldquo;We should talk,&rdquo; I told him. He nodded and went to have a shower.

I went outside and waited.

When he came outside, I was leaning against the car when he came up to me.

&ldquo;This whole thing was really screwed up,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;I didn't expect things to get out of hand like that.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I know. But it is what it is, and what's happened has happened.&rdquo; I looked at him carefully. He was looking off in the distance. It was windy. &ldquo;I didn't expect things to turn out the way they did either,&rdquo; I told him, &ldquo;but ultimately I need to take responsibility for what I did. You could've seriously have gotten hurt, and I don't know how I would've lived with myself if that had happened.&rdquo;

He told me that he knew his body; that he knew he wouldn't get hurt. He wasn't so stupid that he'd agree to something if he thought he could get hurt. &ldquo;That may be true,&rdquo; I told him, &ldquo;and you may have totally believed that. But we didn't. And that's what matters.&rdquo;

He considered this a moment, and nodded.

&ldquo;It was stupid to make this bet with you,&rdquo; Ashton said. &ldquo;I just hope it doesn't affect things between us.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Well, in the end nobody really won man. I felt like shit, Doug felt like shit, your parents felt like shit, and ultimately I know you feel like shit too, even after winning.&rdquo; He nodded. &ldquo;I need to figure out some things about myself and my life,&rdquo; I told him.

&ldquo;Are you leaving?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Yeah. Today.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Jesus.&rdquo;

He looked off in the distance again.

&ldquo;Before I go man,&rdquo; I told him, &ldquo;I need to tell you something. You're still my friend Ashton. Everything that happened was really fucked up, but everything that I'm feeling right now is on me. I still care about you, okay? And I don't hate you. Even though I need to leave, it's because of shit that I need to deal with on my own. And if you ever need any help man, you can call me any time. You got that?&rdquo;

He nodded. He reached out his hand to shake mine. I hugged him. &ldquo;It was good living with you,&rdquo; I told him.

He had to go. He asked me if I'd be here when he got back later tonight. I told him I wouldn't. I was glad that I spoke to him before I left. After he drove away, I went back inside and looked around at the house. I realized that I was almost sad to see it for the last time. I knew that it was the end of an important episode in my life.

I finished packing my car, took with me a couple of the power bars that Ashton had left uneaten, and started the drive home. They tasted awful.

title: Poker's Tragedy of the Commons
tags: [poker]

---

The poker community, momentarily breaking character, has been reflective lately. It all started with [Joe Hachem lamenting the decline of poker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DXSIv8b4KM) at the hands of new-school players. Phil Galfond then weighed in with his thoughts on [how to bridge the gap between new and old-school](http://www.runitonce.com/chatter/speaking-for-the-new-school/). Finally, [Daniel Negreanu went on 2p2]( http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/29/news-views-gossip/my-vision-poker-world-1417120/) to chide new-school players for not preserving the fun of the game; he imagines &ldquo;a world where players think about what's best for everyone first, understanding that in the end they will benefit from that as well.&rdquo;

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bTRsl5V4D_4">[video]</div>

These are all good and valid points. But for the most part, they are unlikely to lead to systemic change. The poker world undergoes such crises of conscience every so often, and this one doesn't seem substantively different. These points have all been made before. And in spite of the open conversation, all of the key parties (old-school, new-school, amateurs, poker sites, and media producers) are still motivated by the same incentives. Acknowledging that the system isn't working doesn't yet incentivize any particular group to change it.

Phil Galfond makes compelling points about how old-school players should be more welcoming and understanding of new-school players, and how media producers should work harder to differentiate the narratives of &ldquo;young genius&rdquo; players. These are wise recommendations, but on their own, they won't solve the problem. Indeed, Galfond, echoing Hachem, places the majority of the weight on the new generation to take the baton and rise to the occasion&mdash;be more entertaining! Make poker fun! Put down your headphones, come out from the hoodie, and give poker a more affable image!

One thing is for sure-the new-school players are the only ones who have the power to change the image of poker. Why? For one, old-school players are, clearly, a dwindling supply. Every new addition to the player pool is by almost by definition a new-school player or an amateur. The pool of old-school players is gradually dropping off, either due to unprofitability or age. Generally speaking, old-school players are much less adaptable, and poker has evolved rapidly in the last decade, leaving many of them in the dust. The narrative of &ldquo;new-school players posing a challenge to the old guard&rdquo; has become quaint and obsolete. We already know the ending. Of course new school players are better. They're winning all the damn tournaments and cleaning up all the cash games.

New-school players are representing a larger and larger portion of the poker populace. They're more malleable, more attuned to global conversations like the ones on 2p2, and hence are better able to uniformly respond to a cultural moment. The &ldquo;old-school&rdquo; is less coordinated, peppered throughout cardrooms and home games across the world. And Galfond is right, new-school players are more nerdy and introverted than old-school players. Poker no longer rewards animated, gregarious hustlers. Now, it breeds calculating tacticians. The type of personalities that succeed in today's poker are markedly different, and that matters. So what's holding the new-schoolers back from initiating Negreanu's cultural revolution?


## Staging the Tragedy

This is the simplest of all game theory dilemmas, known as [a tragedy of the commons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons). All poker players want the state of the games to get better. But the EV of each individual player is maximized by doing all the stuff they want&mdash;seating scripts, listening to their iPod, playing slow and methodically, whatever. Each poker player maximizing their own EV leads to the group's EV getting worse. This leads to overexploitation and the system on the whole degrading.

But this is particularly insidious in poker, because poker players are *trained* to be self-interested. It is continually impressed upon them&mdash;maximize your own bottom line, protect information, capitalize on every edge. Each player is expected to be the vigilant guardian of their own EV. And who can blame them? As games get tougher and tougher, every poker player is alone in fighting for their survival.

But as easy as it is to tell a large swath of players to get their act together, I don't think it's that simple. We shouldn't be misled by archetypes. When we say old-school, we immediately think of Doyle Brunson or Eli Elezra; when we say new-school, we think of Isildur1 or ElkY. When using this sort of token-logic, we're quick to admonish the entire group that they need to step up to the plate. But these pools are composed of many thousands of players, with varying levels of skill and security. It's easy to say to a newly-minted TV tournament star, &ldquo;hey, entertain the table more,&rdquo; but what can you say to the $5/$10 regular who's just barely eking out a living? Or the $10/$20 PLO player whose monthly swings dwarf his average EV? Is it really convincing to tell him, &ldquo;hey, take off those sunglasses and start joking around more, for the sake of all your brethren!&rdquo; In the end, we all know it's players like these who compose the vast majority of the poker world.

How can we reverse overexploitation? And perhaps just as importantly, when we do that, who is going to actually benefit?

Think about it for a second. What does it really mean that the &ldquo;state of poker&rdquo; will be better? Imagine you're an online 10/20 grinder, and your seating scripts are your only chance of landing you into good games. If you agree to give those up and return to the feast or famine free-for-all, who benefits? Well, a rising tide lifts all boats, right? But not yours&mdash;your ability to make a good living off 10/20 will likely seriously jeopardized. *Even if everyone gave up their seating scripts* and the state of poker marginally improved as a result, it probably won't be nearly by enough to offset the amount that you lost in giving up your scripts, because the majority of the benefit will be captured by the people who currently *aren't* using scripts. So, the state of poker isn't better for *you*, even if it gets better on average, because it's only gotten better for the people who aren't doing what you're doing.

Of course, to us as bystanders, the sacrifice sounds reasonable. It seems fair that non-script users should get a leveled playing field. But do the people who're using scripts feel they owe something to those who aren't? Why should they endanger their livelihood just to make things a little easier on other 10/20 regs? They're not going to get any of the benefits, unless poker *vastly* improves (which it won't). What should they care, and why should they be singled out to make that kind of sacrifice?

They've already found the optimal strategy, and now they're being asked to deviate from it in order to benefit other poker players. In no small sense, poker morality can't reasonably ask that of them. It's simply not part of the social contract they had to sign to be part of the poker community. It's understandable for us to get frustrated with how badly the games have now degraded, but to then suddenly act as though players owe us their edges, to demand an imaginary debt be called up&mdash;it doesn't seem like the right answer. It might be self-satisfying rhetoric, but I don't believe it's actually going to convince anyone to give up their scripts or stop taking time during hands.

It ignores the massive impasse that the poker community is really facing.

## The Warrior Culture

We all know that in the last few years, games have grown more scarce, edges smaller, and player pools tougher. I hear it from my clients all the time. Games don't run, the community is shriveling, and people are scared for their livelihood. Of course, this is not a recent trend&mdash;as poker has evolved, money has slowly evaporated. It's been happening continuously for the last ten years. This is nothing new.

But I do believe poker has become a fundamentally different experience. I don't envy those players who are trying to come up in the game now. I started poker soon after the passage of the UIGEA, which was one of the first major blows to online poker. I missed what many of my predecessors called the &ldquo;golden age.&rdquo; But even then, the poker that I stumbled upon was something more beautiful and engaging than what it is now.

When I speak with guys who built their careers playing cash games, I often hear a similar refrain&mdash;&rdquo;poker used to be so much fun.&rdquo; It really did! Poker used to be so exciting, so vigorous, back when I was grinding and moving up in stakes.

As a 6-max player, is there any sweeter challenge than struggling to move up from a $1/$2 to $2/$4, trying to outwit your table nemesis, trying to figure out how to exploit his tendencies? Or, after I became a heads up pro, playing long 4-table heads up matches against guys like Alcohol4Life, Gunning4You, Nemuii, coming back day after day to continue the battle, playing and playing just to see who'd come out on top? Back in those days, people fought for their egos. To sit down at someone's table was an affront. They would post and play you, just to see if they'd win. And, of course, they knew that even if they lost, they could always move down and build back up to wherever they were. Everyone was free in that way to play whomever they wanted. It was not money on the line, but hearts and minds.

It was a warrior culture. Poker was about the battle. It was about being the best, about stepping up onto that crest, at least for a moment. That poker was beautiful. And even more importantly, it was great goddamn fun.

Poker isn't like that anymore.

This is inevitable though. We all knew, even five years ago, that things would eventually get worse. As with all markets, the market of poker must move toward efficiency, and that's exactly what's happened. Edges and loose money have been captured by more and more grinders. 100NL games now are more solid than 600NL games were just five years ago.

And we also know that this is no one's fault. It's a predictable systemic progression. The change has not been due to cultural failings, but due to economics. As money tightens up, edges get smaller, time investments get larger, variance goes up, and ego becomes displaced by safety. There is nothing surprising in this. The unavoidable fact is that poker won't be as fun, enjoyable, or as inviting as it was in the past. The warrior culture won't be coming back.

I lost my love for poker a long time ago. But when I reminisce of that gladiatorial game that I fell in love with all those years ago, it doesn't make me want to play the game again. Because I know that what I loved about the game doesn't really exist anymore.

(Of course, this is reductive to an extent. Yes, people have bumhunted and games have formed around fish for a long time. And the most dramatic of the changes that I'm talking about mostly apply to heads up and high stakes economies; 6-max games still run consistently at lower stakes, and the step-ladder of poker remains intact there. But even if it's not as bad in most games, you still see some degradation across the entire span of poker.)

But I reminisce about all this not merely to be nostalgic, or pessimistic. True, I don't believe that this trend can be ultimately reversed. It might be mitigated by a large change like legalizing online poker in the US, but the march toward efficiency will nevertheless continue. It has to.

And yet, my point is not to say that poker is therefore doomed. My point is simply this: economics precedes culture, not the other way around. A prosperous poker economy create a strong culture that encourages play and competitive spirit. A scarce economy encourages self-interested behavior and greedy strategies. So villainizing those kinds of players in a scarce economy isn't an effective way of dealing with the status quo.

## Ending it All

There are only a few ways to resolve a tragedy of the commons: renewed resources, externally-imposed regulation, or cultural change. Renewed resources are not happening&mdash;the golden days of poker won't be coming back. So we have external regulation and cultural change.

External regulation, such as rules imposed by poker sites, are great for solving many tragedy of the commons situations. HUDs, grimming, and intentional time-wasting are good examples of problems largely solved by regulation. Once poker sites adopt new rules and shake up the incentive structure, they are able to incentivize the entire economy *against* overexploitation. The state of the game improves, while everybody is still doing what's now in their best interest.

Poker sites have enormous power in this equation, and it's clear that they need to be more proactive in orchestrating the poker economy so it doesn't degrade further. Seating scripts may be difficult for sites to detect on a software level, but surely there are telltale behavioral signs of script users (we all know what it looks like). If poker sites announced a week in advance that suspected script usage would start to lead to escalating temporary bans from sitting at any tables (1 day, then 3 days, then 7 days, etc.), or perhaps a simple 3rd strike permaban policy, and *especially* if they were tracking this behaviorally rather than through software, most script users would stop. Software is easy to get around. But if it were behavioral, nobody would really be sure what would be enough to tip off the poker sites. Pretty soon, most people wouldn't want to risk it.

Poker sites have already become more proactive in this role, introducing stuff like Zoom, anonymous tables, various &ldquo;amateur-friendly&rdquo; games, and so on. But clearly they need to go further, especially when it comes to the high-stakes games. Transparency and projecting an image of legitimacy is essential for online poker's well-being (and for being taken seriously when the inevitable fight over its legalization begins).

Externally-imposed regulation is a powerful force. But unfortunately, it has social limitations. It can't stop bumhunting; that's too socially murky. And of course, when it comes to live games or TV poker, brick and mortar poker rooms can't force you to be friendly, or not listen to headphones. Notably, some private games *do* force you to be friendly, by simply not inviting you back if you aren't. This is a splendid example of a tragedy of the commons being solved by external regulation&mdash;whoever's controlling the guest list controls the incentives. But I suspect that socially, we wouldn't be okay with brick-and-mortar poker rooms outright banning players who weren't very friendly.

If we want these behaviors to change, then we must acknowledge that externally-imposed regulation can't reach them. We have to create cultural change. And note, I don't say *hope* for cultural change, because simply hoping doesn't do anything. For significant cultural change this late in the game, it must be actively created, enacted, and pushed forward.

Cultural changes affect our direct moral and social incentives. For example, the environmentalism movement, which made green companies &ldquo;sexy,&rdquo; reshaped the cultural landscape and incentive structure. Companies that once couldn't give a shit about using recycled paper or sustainable energy sources, now have direct incentives from their customers. Could we do the same sort of thing in poker?

To make a cultural change in the poker world, we'd have to make it *not cool* that people discuss strategy at the tables. It'd have to become *taboo* to berate a fish. We'd have to *stigmatize* people who recede into their headphones and hoodies during poker sessions. There would need to be an orchestrated cultural push, starting from the movers and shakers (big-name players like Negreanu and Galfond), and trickling down into the foot-soldiers. But rather than being merely a lament, a cry of frustration, it would have to be an *announcement* of change. That the cultural landscape of poker had shifted. This announcement would have to be clear, coordinated, and unambiguous.

What if that did happen? What if there were specific, clear directives that people pledged to follow&mdash;&rdquo;the next time someone plays excessively slow, or the next time someone discusses strategy at the table, I am going to clearly and explicitly tell them off for making the game less fun.&rdquo; What if people anywhere, everywhere, in card rooms around the country, started actively talking about how to make their poker games more fun? What if this became the dominant conversation?

It's not a ground-breaking conclusion, certainly. But that, I think, is the best chance there is at making a real dent in these issues. Wherever poker sites can solve the problem by regulation and reshuffling incentives, we should leave it up to them. But where they cannot, it's up to the big name characters of poker to step up to the plate and help stimulate that cultural movement.

And for the sake of those who are now trying to come up in this game, I hope that it happens.

Hey gang,

Today (after a brief hiatus due to illness), I bring a new video where I explore the innumeracy bias. The central question I explore is this: are our minds naturally built to think in terms of probabilities and ratios? (They're not, it turns out.) And if not, then what, as poker players, can we do about it?

I am sitting on a porch, and next to me is an old man&mdash;grayed hair, sun-beaten skin&mdash;rocking back and forth in his chair. That man is me. That is, he's the old man I will one day be. He is looking off in the distance, smiling. Why is he smiling? Because he's lived a full life. I can't even imagine how much more he knows than I do. All of my youthful foolhardiness, the mistakes I'm going to make, the lessons that I have yet to learn&mdash;he knows them all, and they strike him as almost humorous. That must be why he's smiling, looking at me out of the corner of his eye. I have many questions for him.

But I don't get to ask him questions. I only get to listen.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OYhazrEYYW0">[video]</div>

This is a mental exercise I call &ldquo;words from the future.&rdquo; It's a powerful visualization that I sometimes do for my clients to help them re-align with their values. It's been fresh on my mind lately, and I wanted to share it with you guys. It's pretty simple. Here's how you do it. First, pull out something to write on.

Imagine yourself when you're 70. You've done lots of amazing things with your life by now. You've had an amazing career, maybe you've had a family, maybe you've won a great prize, discovered something. Whatever it is, it's been one hell of a life. You have many friends, and everyone respects you. But you're old now. And you're full of all the wisdom that this life has afforded you. Just imagine your future self, contented and full of wisdom, rocking back and forth on a chair.

See it? Okay. Now bring in your current self. As you are&mdash;youngish, curious, maybe a little lost or confused. You're sitting next to the old you. Maybe it's raining outside. But the old you is smiling. The old you is going to give you some advice. He's not going to tell you everything, of course. Just the little nuggets that are going to help you get on the right path. You get to take this with you&mdash;a little cheat sheet for the rest of your life.

What are they? Think about it. Imagine it. You know what they are.

Write them down.

Keep them.

Here are mine. I've had them taped to the front of my door so I can remind myself of them every time I head out in the morning:

### Words from the Future

**Everybody has something to teach you.**

**Never lie about who you are.**

**Write without thinking.**

**Stop wasting your time with chicken-headed girls (or guys).**

**You have nothing at all to be afraid of.**

**Think of your family often.**

**The path is paved only by doing, doing, doing.**

**You will be loved.**

**You are capable of greatness, but you are not yet great.**

Those are mine. What are yours? Take five minutes. You don't have to share them with anyone, but really try it. I find this exercise is a powerful way to tap into your own wisdom. You might discover something you didn't expect to realize. (Weird update, I know, but I really felt like sharing this. It's been pretty powerful for me.)

Give it a try,


---2014-04-26-the-dog-of-athens.md
title: The Dog of Athens
tags: [personal]
image: diogenes_ukigua.jpg
---

Diogenes of Sinope was the father of Cynicism, an ancient school of ascetic philosophy. It's easy to talk abstractly though. I like to imagine him: tattered clothes, tangled beard, a scraggly old man. In Athens, Diogenes was known unaffectionately as &ldquo;the Dog.&rdquo; He lived in a discarded wine tub, which he kept out in the marketplace. He possessed nothing more than his staff and cloak. He once had a wooden bowl, but upon seeing a child drink out of his hands, he discarded the bowl as an un-necessity. He was infamous for his disregard of social custom&mdash;he would masturbate in public, he would spit on rich men. He would even eat his meals in the Athenian marketplace (which was apparently a faux pas of egregious proportions). And yet, he was a man of wide and considerable repute. Of his legendary meeting with Alexander the Great in Corinth, Plutarch wrote:

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2msYDr0x2OA">[video]</div>

> Thereupon many statesmen and philosophers came to Alexander with their congratulations, and he expected that Diogenes of Sinope also, who was tarrying in Corinth, would do likewise. But since that philosopher took not the slightest notice of Alexander, and continued to enjoy his leisure in the suburb Craneion, Alexander went in person to see him; and he found him lying in the sun. Diogenes raised himself up a little when he saw so many people coming towards him, and fixed his eyes upon Alexander. And when that monarch addressed him with greetings, and asked if he wanted anything, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Diogenes, &ldquo;stand a little out of my sun.&rdquo; It is said that Alexander was so struck by this, and admired so much the haughtiness and grandeur of the man who had nothing but scorn for him, that he said to his followers, who were laughing and jesting about the philosopher as they went away, &ldquo;But truly, if I were not Alexander, I would be Diogenes.&rdquo;
>
> <div class="source">Plutarch</div>

For my own part, I've always admired Diogenes and the Cynics. Not that I imagine I'm following their philosophy. Their extreme asceticism demands far more balls than are in my possession. But I suppose it pleases me to know that men once lived who could reject the standards of society, and had the courage to live by it.

It's been over four months now since giving away my money and starting over. The first thing I've realized is that even $10,000 affords me more freedom than most people have. I've been living cheaply, continuing to save and nurturing a small nest egg underneath me (in case I run into anything catastrophic, hopefully it will inure me from going into debt). And yet, there is little I feel I don't have.

I've been eating at the same cheap cafeteria almost every day for lunch, cutting most of my other eating-out expenses. I usually only eat two big meals a day now, which saves on money (and time). I've been cooking lots of omelets for dinner. My mother's been teaching me how to make other meals, but they're works in progress.

How else has my life changed? When I wanted to write, I used to go to the UT Law Library. I'd often take naps on their couches. But that requires paying for city parking&mdash;up to $5 a day. So I've started going to the public library instead; I take my naps at home. Really, now that I think about it, the changes in my life haven't been dramatic. I suppose I've been paring down my life in simplicity ever since I came home from Europe. I eat out less often, and I spend less money on stuff I don't need. But most of the changes have been mental ons.

Admittedly, there are some expenses on which I won't skimp&mdash;an exercise regimen, eating healthy food, stuff like that. The things I need to remain centered. But beyond that, not a lot strikes me as that important.

Even when I was a poker player, I always had a fondness for living simply. Every time I'd pack up my belongings, seeing them pared down to a couple bags in the back of my car&mdash;it was a good feeling. A kind of relief, really. It was a reminder that my life was small and unimportant&mdash;that it was supposed to be. When I'd drive cross-country (others would usually fly), I'd never get motels at night, instead I'd sleep in my car along the highway. I invested most of my money. I never bought much into extravagance. Even if I wanted to, I suspect I wouldn't know what to do with the money. Excess is just a silly thing to me. Even money, at times, feels like numbers on a far away field.

Now, writing a memoir and mind coaching, eating healthy and working out a lot, volunteering and spending time with friends, I'm enjoying the process of my life. I don't know if I'll ever become rich again. If I do though, things will probably be different. I imagine I'll probably be more measured in how I spend and invest it. I'll appreciate it a lot more, I imagine. But I think, most of all, I'll be better at putting it to good use&mdash;not just for myself, but for others.

That I might be a canine half as fine&mdash;cheers, you old dog.

Hey guys,

For the next *two days*, I'm going to be accepting applications for public coaching sessions. If you're interested, here's how it works:

[Note: the window for this has now passed. I'll be posting a follow-up very soon!]

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2cjLoO97elo">[video]</div>

* Write in an application (subject: Application), and just tell me a little bit about what games you're playing and what you suspect your mental weaknesses are.

* I'll accept (probably) three coaching clients. If you're accepted, we'll chat a little beforehand, and then record a 50~ min coaching session where we'll try to diagnose and work through your primary issues. Then, a week later, we'll do a short 15~20 minute followup to track the progress you've made.

* As an added bonus incentive, if you write within the next two days (that is, until 5/15/2014), then I'll send you a **free copy of my audiobook** as well (**$17.95** on [Amazon/Audible](http://www.amazon.com/How-Be-Poker-Player-Philosophy/dp/B00IJHYGOM/ref=tmm_aud_title_0)), just for writing in! Just mention in your e-mail whether you'd like the audiobook (since I know many of you already have it), and for those who want it, I'll ship it your way. :)

* The coaching audio will get thrown up on my website, so that other people who're potentially interested in coaching can get an idea of what it's like. If that sounds like a decent tradeoff for free coaching, then go ahead and write in! If you're going through a downswing or have wanted to get a jump-start improvement on some of your tilt, motivation, focus, or anger issues as a poker player, I encourage you to send one in. :)

So there you go! [You can contact me here, as always.](http://www.haseebq.com/connect/) Just make the subject: &ldquo;Application.&rdquo;

I'll update this once the window for applications is closed. Hopefully the results will be pretty cool once I put them up! You might learn a thing or two about how to solve your own tilt/motivation problems. Look forward to it! :)

[Note: you can't get a free audiobook or apply for this anymore. But I feel like I owe you something&hellip;so please accept this funny video as recompense.]

Hey guys,

So the applications came in, and I selected a few people for the public coaching sessions. Thanks to everyone who wrote in! I have a few big names in store for the public coaching. It's going to be exciting, so stay tuned.

I'm going to be posting the coaching sessions one at a time. You're likely to pick up a lot of the techniques and resources I use with many of my clients to deal with common issues, such as tilt, anxiety, motivation, etc., as well as hear their interesting stories. Today we're starting with the first candidate, a very awesome guy by the name of **Scott C.**

Scott is a live $2/$5 grinder who wrote in telling me that he was going through a rough downswing. It'd been affecting his confidence, causing him to tilt, and making him dread coming to the tables. I listened to his story, diagnosed the problems, and came up with a step-by-step plan to start resolving his issues.

This session focuses a lot on **tilt**, **motivation to play**, and **confidence**. Give it a listen. ([External link here.](http://yourlisten.com/HaseebQ/scott-c-initial-session))

Hey guys,

Have had a number of people tell me they got a lot out of hearing the [first coaching session](https://haseebq.com/public-coaching-session-scott-c/) I did with Scott C. Well today I finished my first session with the second candidate, a grinder from Belarus named **Yaroslav**.

Yaroslav is an online HU $200NL-$1000NL grinder who wrote in telling me that he had a lot of anger and tilt issues. He said he was a pretty emotional person in his general life, but wanted to learn how to control those emotions in poker. He'd broken mouses, keyboards, and mugs in outbursts of anger.

This session focuses on **anger**, **hot tilt**, **relaxation exercises**, **making mistakes**, and **how to optimize learning**. Give it a listen. ([External link here](http://yourlisten.com/HaseebQ/yaroslov-initial-session).)

Strap in, because it's time for coaching session #3.

**João** is an MTT grinder whose average tourney buyin is around $150. He's a strong player online, and even took 2nd in several of this year's SCOOP events, but his primary issues were in live poker–particularly, he wanted to make the transition to playing more live tourneys. His challenges were that he got bored easily, would get anxious when his stack fluctuated, and seem to make significantly worse decisions in live games in live games.

This session deals primarily with **boredom**, **transitioning to live games**, and **dealing with anxiety**. Give it a listen. ([External link here](http://yourlisten.com/HaseebQ/joao-initial-session).)

So it's time for the three-week followups. If you're just joining us in our program, I'll get you caught up. A few weeks ago I did a drawing for free public coaching sessions, and posted them publicly. Now, three weeks later, I'm following up with them to see if their poker games have improved, and what we can do to sustain positive changes going forward.

Well, I recently finished the last followups, and to say the least, I was completely blown away. If you were wondering how Scott, Yaro, and João did after their coaching sessions, you might be surprised to see how drastic the changes were!


### ♠

**[Scott C](https://haseebq.com/public-coaching-session-scott-c/)** was $2/$5 grinder who was struggling with motivation to play, tilt, and confidence problems. In the 3-week followup, he claims some pretty amazing life changes–you have to listen to believe it. Direct link is [here](http://yourlisten.com/HaseebQ/scott-c-followup).

You might be wondering what's wrong with these people. Do they have ADHD? Alzheimers? Some obscure degenerative disease? In fact, what they have in common is that they're online multitabling regulars, and their stories provide a chilling glimpse into the murky horizon that awaits many poker players.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JlSsbNc0_u0">[video]</div>

How common are these stories? I first started hearing accounts of it when I was a poker player. I'd even experienced some of it myself. When Pokerstars raised the multitabling limits back in 2007, 12-tabling 6-max games quickly became my bread-and-butter. Before long, playing just four tables would bore me; I didn't have the patience for it. After enough time, reading a book or sitting through a two hour documentary seemed like an ordeal. I'd browse Youtube videos while chatting on Skype and reading poker forums. My brain was continually being fed high-octane stimuli, and when it wasn't, I had trouble focusing.

After quitting poker three years ago, a lot of that had gone away. I'd largely forgotten about it. But when I saw a few threads on TwoPlusTwo with people sharing their stories, it sent me down a rabbit hole of investigation.

## Your Brain on Multitabling

It's impossible to know exactly what poker does to the brain. Poker as it's being played now, multitabled for 500+ hands per hour, is a new and strange phenomenon. There's really never been anything like it. It's been around for less than ten years&mdash;too recent for us to observe its long-term effects. And the scientists who study online gambling are more interested in its effects on addicts and laypeople than its effects on professionals.

We have some anecdotes, but anecdotes don't tell us enough. We don't have a clear picture of what percentage of multitablers this happens to. We assume that online poker is the cause of this, but the causation could be more complex than that. We don't know if these people are simply predisposed toward attentional problems, and perhaps that's what caused them to became multitablers in the first place. Or their problems might be caused by some third independent factor, such as Internet addiction. There are too many confounding variables, so we have to get at the question another way.

## The Price of Multitasking

Picture a 24-tabling regular, staring at two 30&rdquo; monitors peppered with MTTs and sit-and-gos. Decisions pop in front of him and then recede into the background with frenetic speed. He's mentally jumping again and again into different situations, clicking rapidly from game to game.

By constantly switching his mental context, he incurs what neuroscientists call [switching costs](https://www.apa.org/research/action/multitask.aspx). &ldquo;Every time we shift our attention, the brain has to reorient itself, further taxing our mental resources,&rdquo; writes Nicholas Carr. &ldquo;Many studies have shown that switching between just two tasks can add substantially to our cognitive load.&rdquo;

Through switching costs, multitasking almost always decreases our efficiency at any given task. That doesn't come as much of a surprise. But what about for someone who's multitasking day-in and day-out? If you're always multitasking, does that make you more efficient at it? An infamous [2009 Stanford study](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/08/21/0903620106.full.pdf+html) looked at exactly this.

The study compared heavy technology multitaskers against light multitaskers. They expected the multitaskers to outperform the non-multitaskers, but what they found was the exact opposite. The heavy multitaskers were less able to ignore distractions, had worse focus, short-term memory, and were poorer at context switching. According to one of the researchers, the heavy multitaskers were &ldquo;suckers for irrelevancy.&rdquo; &ldquo;Everything distracts them.&rdquo; Notably, these symptoms are similar to what we observed in chronic multitablers.

Usually, the brain adapts to become better at commonly repeated tasks or stimuli. But it seems in this case, the brain's response is maladaptive. Constant multitasking made people's brains *worse* at it. Why?

## The Perils of Overstimulation

Perhaps the high rate of information processing puts so much load on the brain that it weakens other faculties, such as working memory or attention control. It's not implausible. Studies have shown that overstimulation leads to [significant impairments in cognitive function for mice](http://www.nature.com/srep/2012/120731/srep00546/full/srep00546.html). Maybe this is something similar&mdash;perhaps poker players are getting overstimulated, and it's affecting their brainpower.

![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Human_brain.png)

But on the other hand, there are reasons to believe that some multitasking has positive effects on the brain. Studies have shown that complex computer tasks like Internet browsing are powerful mental exercise, and have positive effects on patients with cognitive decline. [One study](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0070350) even introduced non-gamers to Starcraft, the real-time strategy game, and found a significant boost in their cognitive flexibility after a few months. These studies seem to indicate that some amount of multitasking is valuable mental stimulation. So when does brain training become brain overload?

It's hard to say. What's clear is that these multitablers have crossed the threshold into unhealthy multitasking. And chances are, that's not the sole cause of their cognitive impairment. Internet addiction similarly causes impairment of executive control and irritability. According to one study by the University of Melbourne, about 10% of students have Internet addiction. Judging from the accounts given by multitablers, it's likely that massive multitabling and Internet addiction are occuring together and are mutually reinforcing.

## A Trigger-happy Brain

But perhaps the &ldquo;overstimulation&rdquo; model doesn't tell the whole story. After all, it's hard to believe that the brain isn't able to adapt positively to multitasking when it's able to adapt to almost everything else. What if we assume that the brain is adapting positively, but only within a narrow band of behavior? After all, people clearly get better at multitabling over time. The progression is well-known: you have to 9-table before you can 12-table before you can 16-table.

Perhaps the problem is that the multitabler has trained his brain for constant, hair-trigger context switches. By spending so much time in the trenches of multitabling, his brain has become trigger-happy when it comes to switching. This causes many automatic, unwanted context switches. And what's another word for an unwanted context switch? Distraction, of course. In that case, it's no wonder that massive multitablers can't focus. They spend all their time adapting their brain to constant switching, so even if they try to slow down and focus, their brain is still primed to switch at a moment's notice.

Perhaps this best explains these effects on the brain. Or perhaps both this trigger-readiness and overstimulation are to blame. Or perhaps it's something else altogether. So far, we don't know. But either way, it's hard to question that massive multitabling is harmful to our brains.

Dusty &ldquo;Leatherass9&rdquo; Schmidt concluded in his [infamous blog post](http://www.cardplayer.com/poker-blogs/51-dusty-leatherass-schmidt/entries/561296-this-is-my-brain-on-poker) that quitting poker was the only option left to him. But that doesn't mean that all multitablers need take such drastic steps. In fact, a lot of research suggests that there are some ways to buffer against these ailments. In part 2 of this article I'll explore what you can do to inoculate yourself and multitable sustainably&mdash;if I ever write it (I suck, I know).

Until then,

---

It's been almost four years now since I retired from professional poker. I haven't played a single hand of poker since then. I've written a lot about poker, I've coached a lot of poker players, but the game itself is long behind me.

So what comes next?

Ever since I quit, that question has hung over me. What do I do with my life? As a poker player it was an easy question: just get better. For a poker player, that means either make more money, or beat stronger opponents. Both are tangible, irrefutable metrics.

I'm not a poker player anymore. But I've realized that no matter how things change, self-mastery is still my life's goal. Perhaps that's why I was so drawn to poker when I was.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j0DvjgagJko">[video]</div>

As I've matured, the meaning of self-mastery changed for me too. To me, self-mastery means mental, physical, and spiritual excellence. It also means ethical excellence. So over the last few years, I've been working to cultivate virtue as best I can. I've been physically training myself through kickboxing, weightlifting, dieting and fasting. I've been mentally and spiritually training myself through minimalism, self-discipline, and meditation. I've volunteered as a dishwasher and done construction work, tutored refugees in English, and over the last year I've volunteered on a domestic violence hotline and been a hospital advocate for sexual assault victims.

I wasn't a poker player because I enjoyed it. In the same way, I don't do these things because I enjoy them either. I do them because I want to move me closer to the kind of person I want to be. It's a struggle that I hope I never abandon.

So what about my career?

I've been kicking around that question for a long time. There's a lot I could do, but what would be the most valuable? For a while I was exploring law school, organizational psychology, and most recently an MBA. But in the past couple months, I've stumbled upon the thing that I know I need to do. And it's altered the course of my life.

**I've decided to become a web developer so that I can earn-to-give.**

## What's Earning-to-give?

It was a few years ago that I first came across the writings of a movement called [Effective Altruism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism). At its simplest, Effective Altruism boils down to one big idea: be altruistic in a way that's rigorous and based on evidence. Rather than simply following your gut or &ldquo;doing what feels right,&rdquo; EA demands that you think seriously about the best ways to improve the world, and to implement those solutions in a rigorous way, no matter how uncomfortable or demanding it might be.

It's more than just thinking about how to do good. It's thinking about how to do *as much good as possible*. And earning-to-give, which came out of Effective Altruism, is one such strategy.

Earning-to-give simply means pursuing a successful career so that you can donate the money you make to the most cost-effective charities. Where some think the best way to help the world is by directly adding their labor (i.e., entering the non-profit job market), someone who earns-to-give thinks they can help even more by earning money in the private sector and donating that money to charitable causes.

That's what I'm going to do. **I'm going to donate 33% of my income for as long as I possibly can. And once I have some savings, I'll raise that number to 50%.**

It sounds outlandish, I know. And on the rare occasion that I confess to someone my plan to do this, their next question is inevitably:

## Why?

It's funny. I was 19 when I first became a millionaire. I had more money than any adolescent ever should. And I had no idea what to do with it. All the insipid little contests poker players would get into on who made more, who was going to retire first, who had a bigger watch, car, house, they held no appeal to me. Money and luxury seemed empty.

In many ways, I'm happier having left it behind.

So why was I so drawn to poker, a game quintessentially about greed? I think it's because I loved the challenge. I wanted to prove myself. I wanted to get better, and to know that I was good.

I still want that. I think self-challenge is a fundamental part of my soul. But I also want to help people as much as I can. And earning-to-give is a way for me to do all of that&mdash;to challenge myself, to develop my skills, while still living an authentic and ethical life. To help people, to change the world, while still mastering myself as a human being.

I don't want to become rich. I don't want to retire young. I want to fight all of my life for the things I care about, and to become a better person for it.

So that's why I'm earning-to-give.

I decided all of this a long time ago, but it's only recently that I've taken the first steps. I'm flying out to San Francisco this Wednesday, and I'll be embarking on my new career path as a web developer. It's a scary, frantic, and exciting time. And it feels like exactly what I should be doing.

**So why web development?** I'm going to explain that in my [next blog post](https://haseebq.com/why-im-becoming-a-web-developer/). For now I need to sleep. I have a lot of preparations I need to make and people I need to say goodbye to.

I'll be writing again soon.

<p class="note">Edit1: someone asked me why I decided to write all this publicly. Two reasons: one, that I believe it's valuable to do this visibly, so that I can potentially influence others to become interested in Effective Altruism and earning-to-give. Second, to hold myself accountable. By publicly tying my hand, I make it harder to go back on this.</p>

<p class="note">I'm committed now.</p>

<p class="note">Edit2: a quote I read earlier today that struck me.</p>

> However many holy words you read, however many you speak, what good will they do you if you do not act on upon them?
> <div class="source">Dhammapada</div>

A new stage in my life began four days ago. I got out of a taxi on 7th and Market Street, with all of my belongings stuffed into a backpack and one suitcase. To my left, homeless men were peddling their wares and accosting passersby, and on my right, I could see the dizzying buildings packed with San Francisco's most promising startups.

I've never lived in a city like this before. Not like San Francisco. I'm frantically trying to figure out this city and the tech industry. To put it simply, I'm lost and excited.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lv0vRHid5cw/">[video]</div>

## How I Got Here

I've known for a while that I wanted to move to the Bay and [earn-to-give](https://80000hours.org/earning-to-give/). So a few months ago, when I got an offer from a good friend of mine to do &ldquo;growth hacking&rdquo; in a few months for an early stage startup in the Bay, I was really interested. Marketing wasn't what I was ultimately passionate about, but it would be a fantastic opportunity to break into the industry and work with some amazing people.

Wanting to brush up my skills (marketing for startups requires lots of technical stuff), I began teaching myself some basic coding: HTML/CSS, Javascript, R.

Much to my surprise, I enjoyed it. A lot. Not only did I enjoy it, but I was good at it. I picked up ideas quickly, relentlessly attacked problems, and reveled in the myopic flow of tinkering and problem-solving. In a way, it reminded me of what I used to enjoy most about poker.

It began to dawn on me that: hey, if I became a coder, I could go into the tech world from the development side. Rather than market things, I could build them myself. And if I wanted to eventually go into entrepreneurship and found my own company, then I could build that product myself. Even from the financial side, as a coder, I could earn-to-give more quickly (since marketing for a startup doesn't pay a whole lot). It all seemed to make perfect sense. Except for one thing: I was 25 and had hardly done any coding in my life. How was I going to get good enough to actually get a job, much less in the technology capital of the world?

## Coding Bootcamps

I began researching coding bootcamps. Coding bootcamps are a new and revolutionary model in technology education. [Bootcamps.in](http://www.bootcamps.in/) describes them as &ldquo;full time coding schools designed to train students without programming skills … by providing highly focused, accelerated learning programs.&rdquo; Coding bootcamps are extremely structured full-time programs that last around 3 months, and teach students how to code from top to bottom. In the span of just a few months, many learn enough to be competitive with graduates from major CS programs. In other words, it's the hack into quickly becoming a hacker.

I got my hustle on. I made a list of all the best coding bootcamps in the Bay (other than HackReactor, since their start dates were too far away), and applied to every single one of them to start as soon as possible. The next week was a sleepless flurry of teaching myself Ruby and Javascript so that I'd be able to pass these technical interviews. For a week straight, I barely left my room. Code was all I saw and breathed. That might sound awful, but I felt ecstatic. I loved it.

Ten days later, I had five acceptances in hand, including an acceptance at my goal school: [App Academy](http://www.appacademy.io). Alongside HackReactor, it's considered the best coding bootcamp in the world. Their program is 12 weeks of 70+ hours of non-stop coding. It has a 3% acceptance rate, 98% employment, no tuition up front, and an average starting salary in the Bay of 105k. Once I got the call, I celebrated, re-oriented, said goodbye to my old friends and prepared to move to SF.

So that's how I got here. I'm going to become a web developer. Not forever, certainly. But for now, this is what's next.

I'm really f**king excited.

So people have asked me: why web development? Surely there are better ways to make money. I could go back into poker, or go into finance, or even get an MBA.

Those are all reasonable choices, I agree. But I think ultimately, web development is the right choice for me, and I'm going to explain why.

## Why Web Development?

First and foremost, I know that I want to work in the tech industry and in the Bay Area. The culture, the weather, and the ethos of this place have always appealed to me, and have drawn me for most of my life toward that direction. I always knew I'd eventually come here. And who knows if I'll stay, but I know this place is going to be a part of my life.

Second, learning to code is an invaluable skill in and of itself. By getting into this industry I'll be able to survey and understand the landscape of both business and entrepreneurship much better. As a coder, I'll be in a prime position to move in any direction once a promising opportunity presents itself, whether that's working for a tech company, a startup, or an orthogonal industry entirely. It is, in that sense, an extremely versatile credential. Not only that, but it's one I can cash in immediately, unlike one that requires a graduate degree.

I know I'll never be the best computer scientist in the world. That's fine; it's not my goal. I have other advantages that I can leverage in the long run, but I'm going to find opportunities to do that by making my way into the industry.

Third, I find coding very intellectually engaging in a way that I don't marketing, business, or finance. That's no mark against those fields&mdash;each one is complex in its own right. They're just not fields I can get immediately passionate about, and nor are they fields that I can easily penetrate with my hodgepodge credentials. In that sense, coding is supremely meritocratic. Either you can code or you can't, and in the Bay, abilities go a lot further than certifications. I've always appreciated that about poker, and I appreciate that about coding.

Four, going into coding will allow me to earn-to-give immediately, connect with other effective altruists who are in tech, and potentially influence others to get into EA and earn-to-give themselves. Tech seems to attract an ideal profile&mdash;thoughtful nerds who don't have much use for all the money they're making. If I can come out here and do some movement-building for Effective Altruism and earning-to-give, it could lead to an amazing impact. I suspect I could do a lot more here than I could in finance, and certainly more than in being a poker player.

And finally, as a web developer, I'll be able to build shit! It's cool. It's fun. It's an exciting and amazing skill, and one in a market that is (short-term prognoses aside), likely to remain robust, if not grow even bigger. Coding and working with data are skills that will be increasing necessities as our internet-driven society evolves. I'm excited to get involved in that, and bite off a small piece of this giant pie.

And why not poker? Because I made a promise to myself to move on with my life, and that's what I've done. And while maybe I might be able to make money in poker in the short-term, I think in the long-term, this will be a much better investment. And just as importantly, I'll be a lot happier.

So.

To that end, this blog will be changing. I'll still write sometimes about poker, but much of my focus is going to be shifting toward technology, entrepreneurship, and effective altruism. Over time, I'll update the design of the blog to reflect that transition. But for now, I've gotta put my head into the game and focus on coding.

My first class of App Academy starts tomorrow morning. It's 70+ hours of non-stop work for the next few months, so I have a torrent of work ahead of me. Time to start swimming.

It's been two weeks now since I began the coding bootcamp at App Academy. The material has been blasted at us at a breakneck pace, and I've been learning a ton. Among the things I've learned: what &ldquo;90 hours a week&rdquo; feels like. The past 5 days, I've been at App Academy from 10AM till midnight, every single day.

It's strange; it feels like just a few days ago that I first posted that I was going to move out here. But we're already beginning week 3 of the academy. It's all a flurry of building programs and trying not to under-sleep. That said, I've gained more confidence in my abilities as a coder. I'm starting to suspect I really have some potential for this.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5bJ0ldayP24/">[video]</div>

I'm still an acolyte coder. Hell, I'll still be an acolyte when I make it out of this program in 10 weeks. Coding is a mountain, and I'm standing at its base. Even with all this I'll have barely climbed one step. But I like that. That's exhilarating place to be for me.

Almost everyone I meet in San Francisco has some background in tech. And that means almost everyone I meet is further than I am. Everybody has something to teach me. It's an amazing feeling. For most of my life as a poker player, I was the &ldquo;master.&rdquo; For every person I looked up to, there were 100 people looking up to me. It was my job to give answers rather than to find them.

But in coding, it's the other way around. I am a student among students. Almost everybody knows more than I do. The impulse to learn, to get better, is irresistible. There's something absolutely ecstatic about that.

I'm going to keep trying to update this blog, but while I'm at App Academy, most of my writing will probably be constrained to my coding blog I've made. You should read it: I write about my progress through App Academy, talk about the challenges I'm facing, and show the programs I've made.

Everything I've done so far has been pure Ruby (meaning, command-line programs), but they include fully-functioning Tic-Tac-Toe, Hangman, all the way up to Chess, Checkers, and currently working on five-card draw poker! Follow me if you want to ride side-car on my coding adventures.

(Don't worry if you're not technical, I'm going to continually do my best to explain things so that they're easy to understand. And you'll probably learn a few cool things along the way!)

Sincerely trying to get enough sleep,

It's officially official.

At week 8 into my 12 week coding bootcamp, I was whisked into a room with Ned Ruggeri, the co-founder of App Academy. He sat me down and told me that I was the top student in my cohort (40~ students), and asked that I come on as an instructor and help teach the bootcamp. With the position comes a competitive package, the opportunity to teach others what I've learned, strengthen my skills as a coder, and the potential to develop future App Academy computer science curriculum.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j1hWXU7vs9Q/">[video]</div>

I accepted the position. I'll be starting in a week and a half, effectively skipping the last 1/4th of the program to begin teaching. I'm really looking forward to this, since I really enjoy teaching, and I've grown increasingly confident in my skills as a coder over the course of this program. If anybody is interested in going down this same route or interested in attending App Academy, I encourage you to contact me! I'd be happy to chat about my experiences. And having gone through (most) of it, I can only endorse App Academy as having a *stellar* curriculum, and being eminently worth the time and monetary investment.

I negotiated a four-and-a-half month contract, after which I'll decide whether I want to stay and continue to work with App Academy, or seek other employment in the tech world. It's going to be an exciting and busy time for me. In a way, it'll also be my first real-actual-job.

Haha, it's not *really* my first job; I've been working in one sense or another since I was probably 17 years old. I just kind of like that idea.

This also means that I'll begin earning-to-give and getting more involved in Effective Altruism. It's funny, hah. That was exactly my plan: through App Academy, I'd be able to earn-to-give almost immediately. I didn't expect that to happen before the program even ended. Anyway, watch this space! Once I start TAing at App Academy, I'll be able to update this blog again more regularly.

(And to everyone who's been supporting me or offering advice, or just watching me as I wind along my journey, I just wanted to give a big thank-you. And I hope you continue to expect big things from me!)

EA Global, the largest ever public gathering of EAs, has left me reflecting on what it means to be an effective altruist.

A few weeks ago, 400+ attendees and prominent EA activists, including Will MacAskill and Nick Bostrom (and Elon Musk!), converged on a Google Campus in Mountain View to discuss the state and direction of the EA movement. I ended up donning a volunteer shirt and helping out&mdash;time-keeping for talks, directing and crowd-control, moving heavy objects (a weakness of many Effective Altruists), and scrambling to save the conference from various minor emergencies.

 It was an exhausting and important weekend, although it didn't feel important at the time.

Increasingly, EA has come to guide the direction of my life. I'm earning-to-give with my career (giving a third of all my earnings to high-impact charities), I'm helping to lead [.impact](&rdquo;dotimpact.im&rdquo;), a global EA volunteer group, and I'm helping run Bay Area effective altruism [workathons.](https://www.facebook.com/events/392649784261768/)

I'm taking an active role in helping effective altruism to grow. And it's growing at a meteoric rate. Since the formalization of the movement in 2011, it's more than doubled every year. Effective altruism is going to be big, and it has the potential to seriously impact the world.

I want to make sure that happens, and to make sure that impact is as big as it can be. For me, it's probably the highest-leverage way that I can change the world.

----

In saying this though, I've glossed over an important question. Why did I become an effective altruist to begin with?

There are two ways to answer that.

The first way is to say that all of the arguments are compelling. EA's critique of conventional altruism is rigorous and persuasive. If you, like me, are committed to moral consistency, it's hard not to be convinced. In a way, effective altruism begins by pulling softly on the threads of your beliefs, and by the time it's done, your moral imperatives look completely different.

Let's call that the ideological answer. It's the first reason why I'm an EA, and maybe someday I'll tell the story how effective altruism changed my mind.

But right now, I want to tell another story. I want to tell the story of why effective altruism changed not my mind, but my life. Why EA makes me do things that I wouldn't otherwise dream of doing&mdash;like devoting my life to it.

It's not because of the arguments or the ideologies. Those things are powerful, but arguments are paltry against all the history and conditioning behind a human life. It takes something more blunt than that to change someone's life. It takes something powerful and human.

Really, it takes a punch to the stomach.

The other night while walking home, I had such a punch.

----

I was at the office exceptionally late.

It was 1AM when I finally summoned the awareness that I ought to go home. I closed up my laptop, grabbed my messenger bag, put in my earphones and began down the stairwell. On the ground floor, the security guard, a weathered and prunish Asian man, was fast asleep in a leather chair. I gently opened and closed the building door behind me and stepped out onto Market Street.

At 1AM on a Tuesday, SoMa is deserted. The crisp, young professionals are nowhere to be seen. Even the homeless, usually selling their wares or arguing on a street corner, are absent. There are only a few scuffed-up bundles here and there, dreaming against the walls of buildings.

I turned the corner onto 5th street. It was silent, illuminated with street lights. Cars occasionally floated past. The night felt so barren, I could have been in any city in the world.

I can't explain it, but it was a scene of almost transcendent beauty. Do you know what I mean when I say that? There was nothing special about the sight of it. It's just that this was the world, undisturbed, and I was, for a moment, its only witness.

How long has it been since I felt completely alone, I wondered? A long time. It's an important feeling&mdash;perhaps the most important feeling of my entire life. Time and time again I return to it, or if I can't find it I go searching for it.

Looking up at the lights, walking down 5th street, hands in my pockets, I was thinking: this is it. This is the world. The only one I'll ever get to experience. I never asked for it, I don't even deserve it, but here it is.

I became aware of a song in my headphones. It was this one:

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MqWVegTsHZA/">[video]</div>

And I then remember: damn, am I lucky.

I'm lucky to be born in a rich country.

I'm lucky to have headphones, to own this messenger bag. To have two strong legs. To not be in a bundle on the side of this street. To not have grown up fighting drugs, or malaria, or theocracy, or a war. I'm lucky. I'm so goddamn lucky, and right now I barely even feel it.

I didn't earn my birth. I didn't earn my intelligence. I didn't earn my privilege, my health, my values, my messenger bag. It may as well have been divvied to me in an ancient, secret coup.

I didn't stop walking. The song was building in my ears.

Billions of humans in this world. And so many lives burdened and stunted by poverty, illness, trauma, war. Billions. Imagine if you could hear the sound of it all at once. That furious ocean of suffering, which is invisible to me because I'm here. Because of how quiet this street is. Because this street has conspired to squelch the sound and magnitude of that ocean.

----

But you see, it's not the suffering that gets me. I can accept suffering. Somewhere, someone will always be suffering, and I know that.

It's just the injustice of it. It's that the injustice is so big, so absolute, it's almost suffocating. It's so much that you can't swallow right. All around the world, billions of lives&mdash;billions, never given any relief, never given a way out of that ocean.

So why me? Why do I get to walk down this street in silence? Why am I the one with a laptop and a messenger bag?

You see, when I think about this, it makes me angry. It makes me fucking outraged. What would you do if you lived in such a world? In a world that conspires against itself, in a world that is arbitrary and unjust?

Would it make you sick? Would it make you want to goddamn do something about it? To start a revolution? To throw up arms against this invisible oppressor?

That's what it does to me.

It makes me the kind of mad that I almost don't care what I do. That I might do anything to fight it. That I might throw my entire life against this injustice, just to do it, just so I can say to myself and to my children that my eyes were open, that I saw that injustice, and I fought against it.

To me, that's the promise of EA.

To me, EA promises: if you want to do good in the world, I will show you the thing that will do the *most* good.

And when the stakes are so high, and when the question is so dire and important, how could you not take up that promise?

So that's what I've decided to do. That's why I became an effective altruist.

Perhaps you'll become one too.

Six months ago I decided I wanted to become a software developer. I had almost no coding background whatsoever, but screw it, I decided to take the leap. I applied to all of the coding bootcamps in San Francisco, and went into a cave to teach myself nothing but code. I ended up getting into my top choice, [App Academy](http://appacademy.io). I was crushing the program as the top student in my cohort. Two months into the three-month program, the founders asked me to come on board and help teach the course. I'm now working as one of App Academy's main instructors.

Students often want to know what led to my success. They also ask me what I might do differently if I were to do it over again. It's funny, because when I was going through this process, it seemed like all of the info out there on coding bootcamps was sparse and contradictory. So I decided to write the guide that I wish *I* had when going through this process. Consider this guide a synthesis of my own experiences and those of many other successful students.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5yYS6D-C3ew/">[video]</div>

**If you want to learn how to totally crush your coding bootcamp and land an awesome job as a software developer, this guide is for you.**

Let's start at the top.

## Step 0: Taking the Leap

#### Before we make any life-altering decisions, let's first consider: is a coding bootcamp the right choice for you?

Taking a coding bootcamp is a serious life commitment. It might sound like a fun and whimsical field trip into the world of programming, but realize: most of these coding bootcamps demand upwards of $15,000 and a full three months of your life, 80+ hours a week. If you decide to do this, you will have to blow through a lot of savings and the next several months of your life will be devoted to the singular task of learning how to code. In no uncertain terms, attending a coding bootcamp is taking a giant bet, with both your money and your time.

Are you ready to do that? Take this question seriously. Don't just nod to yourself&mdash;taking it seriously means honestly entertaining that it might *not* be the right choice.

#### Some reasons to think you shouldn't take a coding bootcamp:

* *You're not certain about coding.* To be clear, coding doesn't need to be your forever thing, but it's definitely gotta be your foreseeable-future thing.

* *You have a lot of demands on your time.* If you want to try to juggle your book club and a cocaine addiction and your Etsy business of hand-sewn Star Wars plushies, I wish you the best. But if you want to have a good chance of surviving, you're probably going to have to live a pretty minimalistic life for a while.

* *You're bad at math or analytical thinking.* This is pretty much the best predictor for who makes good coders. Coding doesn't really require a lot of math, though. It's just that being proficient in math usually means you have the right kind of thinking skills for excelling at programming.

* *You're doing it just because you want to make more money.* Money is a shitty motivator, and it won't sustain you. Do this because you actually want to learn how to code and you might enjoy making this your life.

* *You have weak communication skills.* This one might be counterintuitive. Isn't programming the stereotypical job for people with no communication skills? Au contraire, my friend. That might be true for fresh grads coming out of Berkeley. But you will not be a typical coder. Once you make it out of this bootcamp, you're going to be an oddball programmer with a non-traditional background. That means it's going to be up to you to sell yourself to iployers; your pedigree certainly won't do it for you. Coding bootcamps equip you with the knowledge to excel in a job, but it's 100% up to you to convince a hiring manager that you're a capable, friendly, cooperative person who they'll actually want to have join their team.

But don't let me deflate your balloon too much. Let's also look at the positive side!

#### Reasons to think you might do well in a coding bootcamp:

* *You're dissatisfied with your current job/life situation.*

* *You enjoy thinking analytically and you pick up new things quickly.*

* *You thrive in high-pressure environments.* You manage stress well.

* *You have considerable savings* or know people who are willing to loan you ~8 months of living expenses and/or your tuition fees. (There are a [number of companies](https://www.credible.com/blog/lending-news/student-loan-options-for-coding-bootcamps/) that can help with outside financing though.)

* *You are innately talented at math or logic* (even if you haven't done either in a while).

* *You have done some programming/web development before and enjoyed it.* (optional) Alternatively, you thrive on technical shit.

* *You're a capable typist and generally know your way around a computer.*

I'll assume going forward that you've thought about this, and you're sure this is where you're supposed to be. Let's start applying then.

## Step 1: Getting In

#### First, apply to every bootcamp in the region(s) you're considering.

There are four main reasons why it's crucial to apply to **every** bootcamp.

* The first reason is that it'll give you practice with the interview process. Even if you're dead-set on going to a particular boot camp (as I was), you'll get a lot out of going through multiple funnels simultaneously. Talking about yourself, working on basic coding problems in an interview context&mdash;these will become easier the more times you do it.

* The second reason is that having an acceptance in hand makes you more attractive to other boot camps. Especially if you're applying to all of the boot camps in a region, they'll all be more than happy to poach a student from a competitor. They're also likely to expedite you through their process if you tell them that you need to make a final decision soon.

* The third reason is that it lowers the stakes. Psychologically speaking, you're going to be less anxious and freaked out if your top choice interview is just one among the many interviews you're doing. Again, even if you're dead-set on going to only one or two of those schools, just having the illusion of fall-back options will trick your brain into calming the hell down. Every little bit helps.

* And lastly, do it because it's easy. Most of the applications are essentially the same, and none of them cost any money. So there's pretty much no downside to it.

#### A Breakdown of Coding Bootcamps in the Bay Area (skip if you're elsewhere)

App Academy, HackBright (women-only), and Dev Bootcamp are Ruby schools. (HackBright is technically Python, but Ruby is very similar to Python, and I believe they're willing to conduct your interview in Ruby). HackReactor and MakerSquare are pure JavaScript (MakerSquare was acquired by HackReactor, so these two schools now have a common application process). There are more schools, but the rest of them are far worse than these. Go ahead and apply to other schools too though, for the reasons stated above.

HackReactor and MakerSquare will require you to do all of your interviews in JS. The other schools are generally more flexible.

The general hierarchy of coding bootcamps looks something like this (take with a grain of salt): App Academy ≈ Hack Reactor ≈ Full Stack Academy &gt; HackBright &gt; Flat Iron School &gt; Dev Bootcamp &gt; Everyone else. So I'd start the application process for the weaker schools first, and move my way up the hierarchy so that by the time I get to a top school's interview, I've already banged out a few of the easier ones.

I'll assume that you, like me, have no real coding background and have to decide which language to learn first. There are a lot of tradeoffs here. You could learn JavaScript, which is required for HackReactor's application process. But this has two downsides: JS is significantly harder to learn as your first language compared to Ruby (it's more confusing, verbose, and syntactically unforgiving). The second downside is that HackReactor requires the most preparation of all of the schools to make it through their application process, and it also has the most backed up start dates.

Given that, I decided to learn Ruby first. This allowed me to finish the application process for App Academy, Dev Bootcamp, and General Assembly (as well as a couple other schools) much faster, and get a swifter introduction to programming. I figured if I didn't do well enough on my first batch of applications, then I'd learn JavaScript afterward and apply to the JS schools. That ended up not being necessary, but it's still the strategy I'd advocate now.

App Academy was my number one choice due to their tuition-free model. Most of these other schools make you pay 15-18k in cash up front, while App Academy only requires a small deposit and then takes 18% of your first year's income *if* you land a software development job. If you end up leaving the program or not landing a software engineering job, they refund your deposit and you basically lose nothing. In short, they're the one school that you can kind of take &ldquo;risk-free,&rdquo; because their business model is to literally make a bet on your success. That coupled with their stellar placement stats (97% employment rate, 105k average salary in the Bay Area) made them the clear top choice for me. But your priorities might look different.

The remainder of my advice will assume that you'll be studying Ruby, but all of this advice will be completely applicable if you're studying JS as well.

#### Learning the Basics of Coding

Start with [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com). Work through their entire Ruby track. Don't waste your time learning HTML/CSS or any web development stuff (like Rails); that's all totally irrelevant until you actually get into a coding bootcamp. In your interviews you will only be considered on the basis of your programming ability, not your web development abilities, so the rest can wait. HTML/CSS is pretty easy once you have the rest down anyway.

Your time on Codecademy will serve as a litmus test. Was it kinda fun? Did you pick it up quickly, or was it like pulling teeth? If you're in the former camp, you're in good shape and this might work out well. If it was a significantly uphill struggle or you didn't really enjoy it, then it might be a sign that you should turn back. Take this signal seriously.

Once you finish Codecademy, I'd start sending out your first applications to all but the top schools. Note, coding school applications move *fast*. Aside from scheduling issues, most decisions are made within a few days to a week. It's nothing like applying to traditional schools. So once you apply, the train starts moving! (You can slow it down if you need to though; just tell them that something came up and you need to delay your next step. No one really minds if you do that.)

Now it's time to start working on proper coding problems. App Academy has some [prep work](http://prepwork.appacademy.io/coding-test-1/) that you can do to get yourself up to speed on basic Ruby. It goes over a basic introduction to programming, which should reinforce what you learned at Codecademy. There's also a set of coding problems that you can work on using [Cloud9](http://c9.io) as an online development environment. App Academy provides [detailed instructions](http://prepwork.appacademy.io/coding-test-1/setup) on how to get this set up.

Work through all of these coding problems. You want to be able to do all of these. It's okay if they take you a long time the first time; any problem that took you an exorbitant amount of time, wrap back around and redo them again. You should be able to get each of these problems in

**Some programming tips early on**: make sure to respect proper indentation. Any looping constructs (while loops, for loops, each loops) require a new level of identation. Any &ldquo;end&rdquo; statement should be de-indented. The body of a function must also be indented. Bad indentation habits is one of the easiest ways to slip up early on: you think you ended a function or a loop when you actually haven't. Get used to making your indentation perfect, both because people will count it against you if you don't, and it'll make you much less likely to make simple mistakes. Other common gotchas include: forgetting to increment your iterator (specifically in while loops) and off-by-one-errors.

Once you've finished all those coding problems, you're ready to apply anywhere. Send in your application to App Academy or whatever your top school is.

You'll now want to start working on more advanced programming problems so you can pass your later-stage interviews. App Academy will give access to a second set of coding problems to work on after your first coding test (which you should have done by now). You should complete the second set of coding problems with the same rigor as with the first batch. Once you finish those, you should now be confident enough in your coding skills to grapple with a wider range of programming problems. Let's start getting serious now.

Get on [Coderbyte](http://coderbyte.com/CodingArea/Challenges/). Do *all* of the Easy and Medium difficulty problems. Their interface is a little crappy and buggy, so I'd recommend using [repl.it](http://repl.it) (set the language to Ruby) to work through the problems.

(A micro-primer on [repl.it](http://repl.it): the left side can be used as a text editor, which you can load into the interactive terminal on the right side by pressing the play button. Basically, write methods or define classes on the left side, click the play button, and then call those methods in the terminal on the right side to view their output. It makes for a pretty nice coding scratchpad.)

Once you're done with Coderbyte, you should probably be ready for your final interview. If you have more free time, go back over all of the problems you've previously solved and solve them again. You can also skip below and do some Codewars if you want to improve your skills further.

Eventually, you'll schedule your final interview. Standard mental game advice applies: get a good night's sleep (force it if you have to&mdash;take some [melatonin](wikipedia.org/wiki/melatonin)), do some low-intensity exercise ~30 minutes before your interview (some jogging or jumping jacks are usually good), and then spend the time immediately before your interview doing breathing exercises/meditation.

Remember, when it comes to your performance on the interview, the marginal hour spent studying will be way less valuable than the marginal hour spent sleeping. Get plenty of sleep.

Then do your interview. Nail it.

Now you're in. Holy shit. Now celebrate.

## Step 2: Pre-work

You're in now. If you haven't quit your job yet, do it now. You'll want to devote all of your time to coding and preparing to live in a new(?) city.

You should have a decent gap until your start date. For App Academy, you'll have a lot of prep work to do. This prep work is really important, so allocate enough time to get it done!

But if you have the bandwidth and want to really crush the course, I'd advocate honing your skills further. Get onto [Codewars](http://codewars.com). Codewars was pretty much my secret weapon coming into App Academy. It's what I claim made me, hands-down, the strongest programmer coming into my class. And I'll explain to you exactly how I used it to accelerate my learning.

Given that I've worked as a mental coach for several years, I know a shit-ton about the psychology of learning. And from a learning perspective, Codewars is the best platform out of any of the ones I found (and there are a bunch: HackerRank, Codility, CodeEval).

Codewars works through a ranking system. Each problem on Codewars is ranked from 8 Kyu (easy) to 1 Kyu (extremely hard). You have an overall skill level, starting at 8 Kyu and working your way up. You gain points and rank up by solving coding problems that other users created. Each problem has its own test suite that you must pass in order to win points. But if you look at the solutions without solving the problem, you forfeit any possibility of winning points off that problem.

The key to Codewars is that every solution gets voted on Reddit-style, which makes the very best solutions bubble up to the top. This allows you to solve the problem, then see the *best way to solve the problem*. This will usually teach you some new techniques or functions in the standard library.

So here's what your workflow should look like: find a problem, and try to solve it ([repl.it](repl.it) is often your friend here). If you can't solve it within 30 minutes, then just look at the solution. Whether you solve it or not, read the best solution and try to parse it. It will often be kind of mysterious and use methods that you don't know. Go look up those methods in the documentation, play around with them, make sure you understand what they do and why the solution works. Make sure you get it.

This next step is essential. **Now do the problem again and try to re-implement the ideal solution that you just read. Do it from memory.** If you forget, go back and look at the solution, and then start over. DON'T SKIP THIS STEP FOR ANY PROBLEM, NO MATTER HOW SMALL.

If you do this, you will become a killer. I promise. I did it, and coming into my program I was way ahead of anyone in my mastery over Ruby. I also advocated this approach to my best friend, a former paramedic with no coding experience whatsoever. When the TAs read his coding test, they told me &ldquo;your friend is a beast. No wonder, I guess.&rdquo;

This method works for several reasons.

1) It ruthlessly trains you in the art of solving problems. If you want to get better at solving coding problems, the best way to do it is just *solving lots of coding problems*. Most of solving these problems is just pattern-recognition anyway, and it builds up a lot of exposure to many different problem patterns.

2) It teaches you tons of methods in the standard library, and makes you use them and grapple with them. This imprints them on your unconscious mind stronger than just reading docs or groping through tutorials.

3) By typing out the best solutions from memory, it'll teach you by hand to write good code style and intelligent, concise techniques. Don't underestimate the power of visceral learning. Just by typing out the code that someone else came up with, you'll absorb the learning through your fingers.

If you do this, by the time you enter your program, you'll be a programming wizard. Take my word for it.

I'd also recommend trying to get as far as possible through [Ruby Monk](http://rubymonk.com) to really solidify your knowledge on the inner-workings of Ruby. I'd say it's less important than Codewars, but if you have the time, intersperse Codewars with some Ruby Monk and try to finish all four of its tracks (though the first one you can probably skip at this point). Ruby Monk will solidify your knowledge on the internals of the language, while Codewars will transform you into a problem-solving machine.

Now finish your prep work and get ready for life in a new city!

Next time, we'll pick up once the program begins, in Step 3, and see how to excel in your course. Watch this space!

2015 has come to a close and I've just finished my first year's donations. In all I gave 33% of my pre-tax income, which since I started my job in June, amounts to $21,200 USD I donated to high-impact charities.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HyMfMYRpHUg">[video]</div>

## Donations

I donated *$5,300* to AMF, the *[Against Malaria Foundation](https://www.againstmalaria.com/)*, which distributes low-cost anti-mosquito bednets in parts of Africa that are ravaged by malaria. AMF is ranked by [Givewell](http://givewell.org) as the most marginally impactful charity in the world.

![](http://www.goodventures.org/images/grants/against-malaria-general-support-2012.gif)

----

I gave another *$5,300* to [*.impact*](http://dotimpact.im), a grassroots EA organization with which I've grown more involved over the last year. .impact is best known for creating a ton of EA infrastructure, including the [EA Forums](http://effective-altruism.com) and [EA Hub](http://effectivealtruismhub.com). Their latest project is LEAN, which helps to seed and support EA chapters all around the world, helping to foster the movement at the grassroots level.

![](http://dotimpact.im/assets/dotimpactlogo-new-ozzie.png)

----

I gave the remainder, *$10,600* to the [*Center for Effective Altruism*](http://centreforeffectivealtruism.org), specifically to the [EA Outreach team](https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/winter-fundraiser-2015/ea-outreach), which is run by Kerry Vaughan and Tyler Alterman. EA Outreach was responsible for [EA Global](http://eaglobal.org/), the major EA conference this year at Google HQ, and have ambitious plans on how to grow the movement and influence more of the world toward evidence-based giving. I think the impact they could have is enormous, and so I decided to give them half of my donations this year.

![](3 of my nominal income. I haven't been able to put much aside for savings, but I'm at least saving a little. The cost of living in SF is pretty steep, so I feel like I've kept my spending respectably low.

## My First Year in Tech

It's pretty crazy how far I've come in this time. I still remember when I first moved into my tiny shared bedroom in San Francisco back in April. I had no idea what to expect. I definitely didn't imagine that I'd get this far in less than a year.

After I matriculated into App Academy, I worked my ass off to learn programming. I was routinely the last person to leave the office, working from 9AM till midnight or later, 7 days a week. Despite how hard it was, it was invigorating to have such focus again.

I quickly rose to the top of my class. At the end of the first 8 weeks of the 12-week course, the founders whisked me into a room and asked me to join the instructional team. I accepted the offer. June 1st, I began my career in tech teaching at App Academy, the coding school I'd just attended. I'd also already begun earning-to-give, a mere two months after coming out here.

To my chagrin, I was immediately placed on a special project working alongside CTO and co-founder of the company, Ned Ruggeri (a Google alum). He put me in charge of all programming work for App Academy's back-end applicant tracking system and the internal tools for our marketing and admissions team.

I soon began giving lectures. Every lecture is rated by the students and tracked for performance. My lectures won the highest rating among all of the teaching staff. Thanks to my performance and the CTO's trust in me, he handed me the entire algorithms curriculum&mdash;a 15-day series of 2-hour lectures covering all of the most important data structures and algorithms in computer science. I was the first person in the history of the company since the CTO to deliver these lectures.

Then in August&mdash;four months ago, three months after App Academy first hired me&mdash;the CEO asked me to stay on permanently. He offered me the title of Head Instructor. I declined. I told them I wanted to help build the company rather than work in instruction. I already knew how to teach, but I wanted to contribute to the business at a deeper level. After some negotiation, I accepted the position of Director of Product for App Academy.

I didn't write about it on my blog because I've barely had the time, but it's a pretty awesome role. Along with writing some of the curriculum and occasionally lecturing, I work alongside the CEO to develop new products, establish partnerships, lead the revenue strategy, and grow the company. I also manage all of the engineering on App Academy's back-end (including our recent website re-design), as well as the new products we currently have in the pipeline. I also just generally do executive stuff and help keep the company running effectively.

It's been a pretty amazing year. I would never have expected to be where I am now when all of this began. I'm growing really rapidly.

But I think 2016 is going to be even more amazing.

Here's to a new year. Here's to changing the world. Here's to staying hungry and learning like crazy.

A couple weeks ago I had my last day as Director of Product at App Academy. This coming Monday, I will be starting work as a software engineer at Airbnb.

Here's the story of why I left App Academy, the tribulations of my ensuing job search, and why I decided to join Airbnb.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sYT_6yGY6LM/">[video]</div>

<div class="note">
<p>Disclaimer: in this blog post and the next, I'll be speaking frankly about compensation packages I received from (larger) companies. I do this for two reasons.</p>

<p>First, because I believe companies often have an unfair informational advantage over candidates, and providing some transparency helps to level the playing field and shift power toward candidates. Second, because as someone <a href="https://haseebq.com/why-ive-decided-to-devote-my-career-to-earning-to-give/">earning-to-give</a>, I already intend to write publicly about my compensation. My hope is that this transparency encourages others to give more. It also pre-commits me to my own intended donations.</p>

<p>My small caveat is that I won't mention the compensation packages from very small (&lt;25 person) startups, which includes App Academy. At very early stage companies, I suspect making compensation packages public is more likely to disrupt a company's operations than to equip candidates with useful data.</p>
</div>

## Leaving App Academy

As Director of Product at App Academy, my role was an amalgam of various responsibilities. I worked with the CEO to help shape the direction of the company, I established new programs and partnerships, I developed new educational products, I wrote curriculum, I worked one-on-one to teach students, I gave many of our CS-heavy lectures, and I contributed to our internal software engineering projects. Needless to say, I wore many different hats and learned a tremendous amount.

But it was around Christmas when I realized that my role was drifting away from software and computer science, and more toward the business side of running a coding school. I was originally attracted to the role because I wanted to immerse myself in a combination of product and engineering/CS. But predominantly, my time was getting monopolized by business and operational tasks.

I wasn't learning as much anymore. The engineering and computer science topics that really interested me were largely orthogonal to App Academy's bottom line. So more and more of my free time I spent reading and thinking about things that were happening at other companies.

Since back in my poker days, I've always had the instinct to seek the company of people who knew more than me. That relentless osmosis is part and parcel of how I quickly became a strong poker player. I'd arrived in the Bay Area not even a year ago, and already I was often the most knowledgeable person in the room.

The conclusion should've been obvious. I was in the wrong room.

I voiced my concerns with Kush and Ned, the founders of App Academy. As much as I loved working with them, after some deliberation, it was clear to me that it was time to move on from App Academy.

The question was, to where?

## Preparing for my Job Search

I had never done an actual job search before. Because I had been hired directly by App Academy after completing the program, I didn't have a solid resume or any projects to speak of.

So, in the free time I had available to me on evenings and weekends, I began beefing up my portfolio. First, I built out my Asteroids game, getting it presentable and fully playable. ([Check it out](http://haseeb-qureshi.github.io/Asteroids/)! It's pretty fun and fully developed now.)

![](https://github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/Asteroids/raw/master/assets/asteroids.gif)

Second, I made a brand new project, heavier on computer science and built in React, to show off my knowledge of front-end development. This project took quite a while to get off the ground, but the process was very satisfying.

Basically, I built an interface that would visually demonstrate local search algorithms solving the 8-queens problem.

[The 8-queens problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) is a classic puzzle of how to arrange 8 queens on a chess board so that none of the queens threaten one another (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). On an 8×8 board, out of 4,426,165,368 possible configurations, only 92 configurations satisfy the puzzle. This makes it prime candidate for a local search or constraint satisfaction problem.

It's pretty fascinating! Many of the best algorithms to solve this problem involve randomization, including iterative repair, which is by far the fastest algorithm I found. [Give it a spin!](http://haseeb-qureshi.github.io/n-queens-visualizer/)

![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/eb84b58a08982181867a06661a7d4c51d7453ffb/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4e4c41464949742e676966)

Having wrapped up my projects, I spent the majority of my free time grinding on algorithms problems and strengthening my knowledge of system design. Before long, I was prepped for the interview circuit.

It was time to start the job hunt.

## The Hunt

I started sending out applications. The standard App Academy advice is to blast out crap-loads of applications. All junior resumes get a low base rate of responses, so the best way to maximize your chances of finding a good mutual fit is to apply widely and aggressively. Basically, treat it as a numbers game.

Yet given my success at App Academy and having been paid to do software engineering, I figured that I'd be a much stronger candidate than the marginal App Academy student. Despite the fact that I was working full time and it wouldn't be easy to send out applications en masse, I was confident I'd be fine.

I couldn't've been more wrong.

Of the 20+ applications I sent, I was rejected from every single one without so much as a technical screen. One recruiter from Udacity did actually get on the phone with me&mdash;I had pointed out a CSS error on their website in my application and uploaded a private Youtube video showing them how to fix it. The recruiter thanked me and we joked about it, only for him to later tell me they weren't looking for anyone with my skillset. Again, without even a technical screen.

I started to worry. Was I just completely unsellable? Was my background just too all over the place to be worth anything as an engineer?

My resume was a hodgepodge, no doubt. Professional poker player to mental coach to author to programming instructor to Director of Product, with a degree in English from the University of Texas. Maybe my resume was automatically getting binned everywhere it landed.

Or perhaps, and more likely, the problem was that I was trying to get in through the wrong door. I'm reminded of a quote I recently read by Alex Banayan:

> All highly successful people treat life, business, and success just like a nightclub. There are always three ways in.
>
> There's the First Door, where 99% of people wait in line, hoping to get in.
>
> There's the Second Door, where billionaires and royalty slip through.
>
> **But then there is always, always&hellip;the Third Door.** It's the entrance where you have to jump out of line, run down the alley, climb over the dumpster, bang on the door a hundred times, crack open the window, and sneak through the kitchen. But there's always a way in.
>
> Whether it's how Bill Gates sold his first piece of software, or how Steven Spielberg became the youngest director at a major studio in Hollywood &mdash; they all took the Third Door.

Almost everything in my life I've been successful at, I've gotten in through that third door. Becoming a world-class poker player under the age of 18, learning how to code and getting into coding bootcamps in a single frenzied week, or getting hired into App Academy straight as a student and three months later rising up to become Director of Product and teaching their entire algorithms curriculum.

Perhaps this was another case of needing to find that Third Door.

I began plumbing my network. I had one big advantage I hadn't yet leveraged: the students I'd taught. Many of them were working at very strong companies, though they were mostly very junior. At least with their referrals, I'd be able to crack open that window.

Every student I asked was more than excited to refer me. Finally, I had fast-tracked myself into the processes at several awesome companies: Shift, FutureAdvisor, PagerDuty, and Twilio.

I was rejected at all of them. Again, without even a technical screen.

By now I was panicking. But somehow, through the flurry of rejections, a referral from a classmate of mine who was working at 23AndMe came through. He had paired with me during our cohort and spoke very highly of me, so they scheduled me for a technical phone screen.

I was nervous, but once I got on the phone and got rolling on some concrete questions, I crushed everything my interviewer asked me. He was blown away. He told me he'd never heard as thorough of a technical analysis on this problem before, and immediately invited me to do an onsite at their headquarters in Mountain View.

I killed the onsite. And when I say killed, I mean murdered with such ruthless brutality that my children's children will carry the sin with them. To this day, it's the onsite that I felt most confident in. I remember pacing back and forth at the CalTrain station as I awaited my train back to San Francisco, savoring how masterfully I deconstructed each and every question they posed to me. It seemed like everyone who'd interviewed me was ebullient at how quickly and rigorously I'd answered all their questions.

Finally, it seemed like I'd cracked the code.

A week and a half later I open my inbox, and there fresh and white, a reply from my 23AndMe recruiter. The subject: 23AndMe. I open it up to read:

> &ldquo;Thank you for your patience and your time to meet with our SWE team. We appreciate the opportunity to consider you for employment with 23andMe. I want to update you on our search and let you know at this time we are moving ahead with another candidate.&rdquo;

###  To be Continued…

<p class="note">(Note: this is the second part of this story. <a href="https://haseebq.com/farewell-app-academy-hello-airbnb-part-i/">You can read the first part here.</a>)</p>

Despite the rejection from 23AndMe, I kept pushing.

I applied to the all the big hiring websites. [Hired](https://hired.com) rejected me from their platform. I got no bites anywhere on [AngelList](https://angel.co) or LinkedIn&mdash;not even cold e-mails from recruiters. Nothing from [WhiteTruffle](https://whitetruffle.com) or [SmartHires](https://www.smarthires.io).

Not a breath of interest anywhere.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7cA0mwsfpVE/">[video]</div>

I kept on. I asked friends, students, anyone I knew for referrals. I started reaching out to non-engineers. I asked anyone at all who worked at all at a tech company I found compelling.

I was nervous. Was I a fraud? At App Academy I might have seemed like a paragon, but to the rest of the world&hellip;was I simply not good enough?

## A Swing of the Pendulum

In the middle of this flurry, I created an account on TripleByte. [TripleByte](https://triplebyte.com) is a young YC startup that's trying to change tech hiring. From [their manifesto](https://triplebyte.com/manifesto):

> Credentials should not be used as a proxy for talent. Education and work history are meaningful but relying solely on them results in missing good programmers. Good programmers come from all types of background. It's what you can do that matters, not where you went to school.

Their interview process is completely blind to credentials. They decide to work with you purely on the basis of a technical assessment, then they learn about your credentials and then introduce you to startups they determine are a good match. Though they mostly work with experienced software engineers, I decided to give them a try.

To my surprise, I was able to pass their anonymous programming quiz and I was automatically invited to an onsite assessment. I showed up sheepishly to their office on King Street, and over an intense three hours I was grilled by my interviewer on coding, data structures, algorithms, and system design. At the end of the interview, he asked me what my computer science background was. None, I told him. I'd learned this stuff on my own and from teaching at App Academy. He was taken aback, and told me I was incredibly strong for only having studied this material less than a year.

The next day, TripleByte called me. They wanted to work with me! They'd introduce me directly to startups in the YC network. This was exciting&mdash;there were a ton of companies in YC network I wanted to talk to: Stripe, Twitch, Airbnb, to name a few.

Well, as it turned out, those companies weren't really looking for someone like me. Since TripleByte is a two-sided process, they matched me up with companies for which there was a good mutual fit&mdash;Stripe, Twitch, or Airbnb were nowhere on that list. However, one of the companies they matched me with was Gusto, formerly Zenpayroll (and now a timely Zenefits competitor). I'd previously had my eye on them, so I was excited to see them matched up with me. They also lined up an onsite at a small YC startup called Flexport.

TripleByte had gotten things moving. But even more importantly, they had given me back some confidence. TripleByte wanting to work with me was a small affirmation, to be sure&mdash;it wasn't even a job offer yet. But it felt like I'd finally pierced the membrane. If these guys thought I was good&hellip;I must have it. I just gotta prove that to everyone else now.

## Onsites and Offers

I set off to the onsites. The first of the two, Flexport, was a freight company. In many ways, it seemed more like a logistics company than it was about technology company. But I felt like I performed well in the onsite.

A couple days later: no offer.

I was supposed to be upset, but by now this was an old game. I brushed it off. Each interview I could feel was making me better at interviewing. It was getting easier and easier to relax, to ask for what I needed, to make jokes, to grill my interviewers. I was getting into my rhythm now.

Rejected? It is what it is. Just keep putting in the practice, I told myself.

Next was Gusto. They were a groovy company (no shoes in the office!), and the interview was a delight. They told me they'd get back to me within a week.

Shortly afterward, an onsite from Yelp pulled through (my referral was through a non-engineer!). I went onsite and completely rocked it. Every interviewer was clearly impressed, and they immediately asked me for my references afterward. Perhaps things were looking up! It seemed like one of Gusto or Yelp might actually convert into an offer.

All the while, I kept putting more irons in the grill (gotta keep that kitchen running), and kept studying up on algorithms and system design. Around then, I got an e-mail in my inbox from TripleByte:

> Saw you're starting to get some interviews booked with companies!
>
> I actually wanted to throw another company option into the mix, us :) We're hiring to build out our engineering team, we really enjoyed meeting you and would love to talk more about that if its of interest. Just let me know and I can give you a call tomorrow!

Shit. Really?

I hadn't considered joining a super small company. I'd already spent the last year at a 25 person startup; TripleByte was only 5 people. But I knew entrepreneurship was somewhere in my future, and eventually I'd be joining a super early stage startup (if not founding it myself). TripleByte was a fantastic company, already with huge traction in the tech hiring space. Their founder, Harj Taggar, was a former YC partner, and one of the most charismatic and capable people I've met.

They wanted me. A company actually wanted me! A good one! I laugh now, but it was a revelation to me. They invited me in for another onsite so the rest of the team could vet me.

Before I could savor it too long, I received a phone call soon after. Yelp recruiter. Yelp wanted to make an offer.

And with that, the first domino fell.

----

Then came the Gusto recruiter. Gusto wanted to make an offer.

A TripleByte offer came soon in tow. First I had nothing, now I had three offers in front of me.

And yet, it was a little bittersweet. Yelp's offer was 105K salary with ~17K/yr in equity. Gusto hit around 115K with comparable equity in options, and TripleByte was in the same ballpark.

Now, if you're outside tech (or the Bay Area), those might sound like knock-down amazing offers. But all of these offers were lower than I was currently making, and they were all for explicitly junior roles.

Still, 105K might sound like a lot of money to be miffed about. But in San Francisco, with the second highest cost of living in the US (behind only Manhattan), the purchasing power of $105K in SF is the same as making about $57K in Austin, Texas. I also still owed App Academy tuition (18% of my first year's salary), which was deferred because of my employment by App Academy. That 18% would come due on whatever offer I accepted. And of course on top of that, I'd also be donating a third of my income.

But really, what stuck out most to me is that I'd be leaving App Academy to a downgrade. I would be no better off than if I'd just joined those companies a year before. My goal, somewhere in my head, was to make at least more than I was making now. An arbitrary benchmark in a lot of ways, but it was hard to give up.

Was what I'd learned over the last year working at App Academy not worth anything on the market?

Maybe not. Perhaps I just had to accept it.

----

Now that I had offers in hand, it was time to turn the crank. I reached out to every company I was talking to and told them I'd just received several offers, but was very much interested in moving forward. With that, suddenly recruiters started tripping over themselves to get me on site. I was no longer the ugly boy at the party.

I started mowing down onsites. My performance and experience were no different, yet I was treated completely differently. Phone screen from Google. Gusto raised their offer. Phone screen from Stripe. Yelp raised their offer. TripleByte raised their offer. Then the phone screen at Google converted to onsite.

Bam. Suddenly Google was in sight. I felt like Captain Ahab: for me, Google was the Big One.

My Google recruiter worked for the Youtube team (headquartered in San Bruno). That meant if I were to receive an offer, the Youtube team would have first dibs on me. The interview process is standardized Google-wide though, and Google would ultimately be my employer. I spent the weekend before practicing and took the day off from work so I could head down to San Bruno for the interview.

I arrived that morning at the San Bruno BART stop, hardly having gotten any sleep the night before, and walked 30 minutes to the Youtube campus in downtown San Bruno. It was still early, so I sat in the lobby and read over my notes from Cracking the Coding Interview for some thirty minutes, trying to keep my cool. Finally, the recruiter came out and met me and brought me to the interview room.

Unequivocally, Google was the toughest and most nerve-wracking interview I've ever done. The problems were complex and challenging, all abstract and extremely algorithms-heavy. They didn't ask me a single thing about architecture, systems design, web development&mdash;all they cared was that I could solve hard abstract computer science problems. All the interviewers&mdash;clearly brilliant (and all older white men)&mdash;were stony and tight-lipped about my performance.

I walked back to the BART station that evening, exhausted and completely drained, without any idea whether I'd done well or bombed.

A week later, I got a phone call from the Google recruiter.

I was in. Google wanted me.

----

Their offer was reasonably strong&mdash;120K salary with a 15% guaranteed end-of-year bonus and 24K/yr in RSUs. The total package came out to 162K/yr annualized&mdash;much stronger than my other offers, but around the ballpark of what fresh graduates of App Academy who landed at Google would earn. In other words, it seemed they didn't place me very high on their spectrum. But whatever, right? It was Google! I got Google!

With that, the floodgates opened. Just the whiff of the Google name got recruiters into a frenzy. Companies that wouldn't even look at me now bent over backwards to expedite me through their funnels.

Stripe onsite. Uber phone screen. Twitch phone screen. Uber onsite. Stripe offer. Twitch onsite. Uber offer. Twitch offer. The offers came in, stronger and stronger. All the irons I'd put in the fire were now going off like Roman candles.

Which left me with the question of: well, shit, what do I do with them?

## Deciding Factors

As the offers came in, I weighed them seriously. Every single company I talked to was compelling and had aspects that made me want to work there.

But in the end, it was hard to argue against Google being the best choice.

The first and most visceral reason was I'd never have to deal with this BS again. Google would be a golden mark on my resume&mdash;like the Harvard of software engineering. Never again would I have to worry about credentials, or people tossing my resume without reading it. Google is the one name I'd be able to brandish anywhere as *undeniable* proof of my legitimacy as an engineer.

Part of it had to do with my ego, no doubt. But this job search had shown me that part of it was very real and material.

Of course, then there was the compensation. Google would be hard to beat. Like Yelp, Google was a mature public company, so its equity compensation was as solid as cash. That liquidity is an important factor when it comes to earning-to-give&mdash;it means I can [give sooner](https://80000hours.org/2012/04/the-haste-consideration), which has compounding positive impact and flow-through effects.

On top of that, Google was the only company to do a donation matching program, up to $6,000. That's an extra $6,000 a year that goes to charity that otherwise wouldn't. When it came to earning-to-give and building my career, when I looked at the numbers, it seemed clear I couldn't justify choosing any company other than Google.

At that point, it seemed like a done deal. Companies like Uber, Twitch, Stripe, TripleByte, were all awesome companies. But it had to be Google.

Google! I was on cloud nine. I was ready for everything to wrap up as I figured out which bus I would be taking to San Bruno, planned out my morning workout regimen, and all the rest.

But the irons in the fire were still shooting off sparks. Offers improved, sometimes without any prompting on my part. They became increasingly stronger and stronger. Soon, they started overtaking Google's.

I hadn't negotiated with Google at all, so I knew the Google offer would move upward. I expected Google to settle somewhere around 180K all-in, which would be a healthy jump upward. But I started to really think: what would it take for me to turn down Google?

It was a tough question. Because I was in a competitive situation, Google had allowed me to start chatting with Youtube hiring managers and essentially pick my team.

I was offered a spot on the Youtube Red team, doing back-end work in C++. A small and fast-moving team in one of Youtube's shiniest new projects. It would be tough, certainly, to learn the technology and start becoming productive. But I'd be doing world-class engineering, and have a world-class company on my resume.

And yet, I couldn't deny: there was something energetically captivating about each and every startup I talked to. There was something deeper about them that attracted me, something was missing from Google. Not just the growth and the responsibility, or the greater self-determination. Each of these companies were innovators, creating new value in an uncertain future, and&mdash;they needed my help.

They actually needed my help. That was captivating. And it was hard to ignore that I didn't really feel that in my interactions with Google.

But Google continually assured me that they'd be able to beat any other startup's offers. It seemed like a decision they were happy to make for me. As other companies kept bidding up, the Google offer moved up to 185K. And as I was moving into final negotiations, they assured me there was still more room for the offer to grow.

More room to grow? How bad did Google actually want me?

## Enter Airbnb

It's funny. I had initially been rejected by an Airbnb recruiter for a different position more than a month before. Airbnb wasn't even on my radar. So when Ned, the CTO of App Academy told me he'd put me in touch with his friend David at Airbnb, I mostly brushed it off.

Upon Ned's glowing recommendation, David met with me and agreed to refer me into Airbnb. With his referral, I was promptly un-rejected. David was a senior engineer there, and his recommendation seemed to carry a lot of clout (the Google offer helped of course), so I was quickly shuffled through to the phone screen.

I wasn't expecting to do too well&mdash;I'd read in many places that Airbnb had an extremely challenging interview, and that they were more credentials-focused than other companies. So much so that I'd never heard of a bootcamp student getting placed at Airbnb. Apparently they used to post on their job listings: &ldquo;no bootcampers, please.&rdquo;

On the phone interview, I received a pretty challenging problem&mdash;I remember thinking when I got it that I was going to mess it up. But somehow I solved it with ease, and all of my outputs were correct. I'm not sure whether to attribute it to the accruing notches on my belt or to blind luck, but I aced the phone screen and they eagerly brought me on-site.

I've always had a lot of respect for Airbnb as a company&mdash;I was an early Airbnb user myself&mdash;but even as I was walking into their large and beautiful campus, my mind was already made up. I was joining Google.

The Airbnb interview was long and challenging. But, unlike the Google interview, it was invigorating. I met with payments engineers, infrastructure engineers, even a political analyst who worked on European Airbnb regulation. I was challenged on my understanding of algorithms, of caching layers and database indices, I was questioned on my beliefs about the human right of free movement across borders and on the future of travel.

I loved it. I loved everyone I met. Even more, I loved the spirit of Airbnb. Everything about it&mdash;the beautiful cosmopolitan office built as an homage to Airbnbs around the world, the people, the technology, the raw energy and drive toward connecting the world more tightly together.

Airbnb's mission is simply, &ldquo;Belong Anywhere.&rdquo; I've been both an Airbnb guest and a host for years, and before that I was an avid Couchsurfer and Couchsurfing host. I believe strongly in the culture of sharing and interconnection.

But even so. Yeah, Airbnb was pretty cool. (And walking distance to my house!) But still, Google is Google&mdash;the tech equivalent of getting an invitation to the Justice League. How could I turn that down?

After the interview, Airbnb was slow to get back to me. Being a challenging interview, I was unsure whether an offer would come through&mdash;much less, if it could change anything. I'd already finished my last day working at App Academy, and was now officially between jobs. I decided to head home for a bit to wrap up my negotiations and rest up before starting my next gig. I had a short deadline until I wanted to start, and let each of the companies know. It was now time to go into final negotiations.

## Turning Point

I get the phone call. Airbnb wants to make an offer. I have less than a week, but they're scrambling to piece everything together to meet my deadline. They'll get back to me.

They get back. Initial offer, 220K.

220K?

Jesus Christ.

What??

What on earth are they doing offering me 220K? This company must be out of its goddamn mind. No wonder tech is so overvalued. I lost my shit.

I had to take this really seriously now. Airbnb's offer was highly illiquid, but they were offering me a very strong base salary: 130K, 25K signing bonus, and 65K worth of RSUs a year. Not as liquid as Google, no doubt. But Airbnb as a company was barreling toward an IPO, already worth more than 23B, and was of the most robust tech companies from a business and revenue perspective. Besides, if I'm risk-neutral&mdash;which I think I am&mdash;then it's a clearly better deal.

I began really weighing things. Google&hellip;was Google. I already knew its advantages.

But at Airbnb, I'd clearly be able to take on more responsibility more quickly. The engineering organization was slated to double within a year. I was already very familiar with Airbnb's tech stack, mostly Ruby on Rails, since it was what I'd been teaching at App Academy and developing on for the last year. It was also younger company. Unlike Google and its &ldquo;lifers,&rdquo; this was a place where I'd be more likely to meet people in an earlier stage in their lives&mdash;and meet potential co-founders.

Of course, it was also walking distance (the ol' commute-less commute).

But, seemingly more affecting than all of those things&mdash;they needed me. At Google, I'd be a smart person sitting in a smart person chair. I'd be doing serious engineering work no doubt, but by the time I'd be done, I'd be walking away having changed little more than my own resume.

At Airbnb, they really needed my help. They believed I could make a difference. For the life of me I couldn't figure out why, but they made it clear. They thought I was valuable, and they wanted someone with my experience.

God, I'm a sap.

I had less than a week to decide. I didn't know how to make the decision. So I started trying to evaluate everything objectively. I tried estimating the value of different outcomes. I tried to ascribe weights and calculate the value of things like network, branding, growth, faster promotion, potential for meeting co-founders, likelihood of IPOing. But nothing was convincing. It felt like an impossible choice. Before long it was Thursday night and I had to make a decision before the end of day Friday. There was a lot of cursing.

Google was assuring me that they'd raise their number by Friday morning. That night I couldn't sleep. I repeatedly got out of bed, pacing back and forth rehearsing conversations, frantically checking my e-mail and re-tweaking Excel models. What the fuck? Just a few weeks ago I could barely get anyone to look at my resume. My first offer barely cleared 120K. 220K? What on earth is Airbnb thinking??

That night and the following morning, I called up trusted friends and asked them what I should do. I was on the phone off and on for several hours through that morning. The consensus was overwhelming.

Everyone thought I should go with Airbnb.

## Final Hours

That morning, worn thin with sleep deprivation, I got a call from Google. They were raising the offer to 211K. That's 211K. Liquid. I'd receive all of that before a year's end. I remember scratching my chin and just laughing. God fucking dammit. I thanked my recruiter, and let her know I'd get back to her before the end of the day.

I knew Google would have a strong final offer, maybe upwards of 200K, but 211K was stronger than I'd expected. Still, it shouldn't sway my decision, right? Was this really a decision within a margin of 10K in EV? No one else seemed to think so. If Airbnb was the winner, it should still be the winner now.

Right?

I told myself: if I'm choosing Airbnb, just remember. 220K was their *initial* offer. That means there's money on the table. If there's one thing this job search had taught me, is that there's always, always more money on the table.

As an instructor at App Academy I ceaselessly pushed my students to negotiate hard, without fear of being rejected, looking stupid, or being perceived as greedy. Employers negotiate even harder and with more power behind them, and so it's up to candidates to tip the scales back in the direction of employees. As absurd as it seemed now, given an offer of 220K, I had to take my own advice and ask for more. I rehearsed it again and again in my head.

But if I'm going to ask for more, I shouldn't just ask for 10K more. I should expect to be met somewhere in the middle, right? I've got to be aggressive. But I don't have any stronger offers and they know that, so maybe it's stupid.

Fuck.

I called my recruiter from Airbnb and, half expecting to get laughed at, announced: &ldquo;If Airbnb can move up the RSUs by 30K to hit a total of 250K in all-in compensation, then I'll sign.&rdquo;

&ldquo;250K? Do I have your word?&rdquo; she said.

&ldquo;My word.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Okay. Let me see what I can do. I'll get back to you before evening.&rdquo;

The rest of the afternoon was a blur of habitually checking my phone, email, anything for some word of what would happen. I was driving my car into Austin, bumper-to-bumper in traffic when I got the phone call. It was the Airbnb recruiter.

&ldquo;Haseeb? This is Janice.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Janice! What's the word??&rdquo; I held my breath.

&ldquo;I made the magic happen. 250K. 130K salary, 25K signing, 95K a year in RSUs. So you're in?&rdquo;

I almost swerved into the car next to me from punching the air so hard.

&ldquo;I'm in.&rdquo;

So that's the story. I start on Monday.

## Overview

On the whole, I'm really excited to be joining the Airbnb family. It's definitely a different path than Google. Most significantly, there'll be less that I can donate to charity in a year's time. But not only is the total value of the assets greater, I'm also convinced that in the longer term, Airbnb will be the better move for my career.

Stock in a private company is of course still a valuable asset&mdash;I just won't be able to donate a third of their value until a liquidation event (hopefully an IPO). But my pledge to donate 1/3rd of all of my income, including my salary, doesn't change. Ultimately, this will be a better move in terms of EV, provided some discounting for the fact that I'll have to donate later in the future.

That said, the brand of the company was obviously an explicit consideration for me. From that perspective, my choice to join Airbnb might seem a little strange to some. In many parts of the world, Google and Airbnb wouldn't even be said in the same sentence. But within the SF ecosystem, Airbnb and Google are largely considered to be in the same tier of engineering organizations. I'd even argue that among certain crowds, Airbnb would be a stronger signal on one's resume than Google would be.

So I think, on the whole, I really got lucky with a company that's a perfect fit for what I'm looking for.

One other thing I want to add. I know some might think it's weird to be sharing your compensation in a public venue like this. I take my inspiration from [Jeff Kaufman](http://www.jefftk.com/donations) (who ironically works for Google, albeit in Boston), who donates 50% of his income to EA charities and catalogues it publicly every year.

The norm of keeping compensation secret is a very American one. And I think on the whole, it stifles transparency and open dialogue about things like class and economic inequality. But more poignantly, it makes it harder to be transparent and galvanizing about earning-to-give, which is very much one of my goals.

I explicitly entered into tech a year ago because I believed it was a place where I'd be uniquely well-suited to create a lot of value. It's an industry where smart, driven young people can quickly earn an outsized income. Seeing that opportunity, I decided to pivot into tech and make building a career here an active aim of my life. And I hope to, as long as I can, continue to speak openly about my compensation and give even more of it away.

So that's enough of soapboxing. Here are some stats.

## A Few Statistics

By the end of my process, I had received a total of 8 job offers (not including re-negotiation with App Academy). I had completed 12 onsites total, so my I had a total onsite-to-offer rate of 66%.

Considering only the onsites after receiving my first offer however, my onsite-to-offer rate was 87%.

Of my offers, 2 of them were through TripleByte (one from TripleByte itself, the other, Gusto, through their introduction). The remainder were through referrals. Two of the 6 referrals were non-engineering referrals.

There were 12 companies where I was referred but did not receive an offer. 25% of the companies I was referred to didn't even talk to me. But that was a lot better than the base rate: overall, 53% of companies I applied to through any means rejected me without even talking to me.

In the end, I didn't get a single offer through a raw application. Every single offer came through a referral of some kind. (This I did not expect, and strongly influences the advice I'd give to a job-seeker.)

The differential between my lowest (initial) offer and my highest (final) offer was, in total value, an increase of 104%. That is, my compensation literally more than doubled by not accepting my first job offer. (I expect this to be highly anomalous, since companies had a lot of discrepancies in where they leveled me on their engineering ladders.)

The largest percentage increase was also with my lowest initial offer, Yelp. They started at a total annualized value of 122.5K (105K salary + 17.5K stock), and their final offer was at a total value of 180K, an increase of $57.5K, or 47%. Again, I expect this to be anomalous, because I literally jumped in engineering levels (they initially offered me a junior role, then re-evaluated). The second largest increase was from Google, moving up $48.6K for an increase of 30%. This one is perhaps less anomalous. I'm not sure.

On all but two of my offers, I negotiated. The average delta for company offers at which I negotiated was +$30,671 for the final offer. So, negotiation pays, boys and girls. More on that later.

In total, I received offers from Airbnb, Youtube (Google subsidiary), Uber, Twitch (Amazon subsidiary), Yelp, Stripe, Gusto, and TripleByte. The average value of the final offers was approximately $193,600. The salaries were all approximately the same at $130K. (Only one company offered me a base salary of $125K.) I should also note that I negotiated more aggressively on RSUs and signing bonus. I'll also talk more about that later.

There's obviously a lot in this department, but this blog post is already long enough. I'm going to write one more post before I start at Airbnb this coming Monday: my key takeaways from this job search, and advice to current job seekers. I'll also talk more about my thoughts on negotiation in that upcoming post.

Look forward to it!

### Update (4/25/2016)

This post has gotten a lot of unexpected attention, so I want to clarify a couple things.

First (and this should go without saying), everything mentioned in my story are my own thoughts and words, and though I am employed by Airbnb, I in no way speak on their behalf. (It's legally important to say that, I guess.)

That said, I realize that pay transparency is a controversial subject, and I seem to have stirred up a hornet's nest. So I want to make clear a few things.

Many people seem to think that publicly disclosing your compensation is a fireable offense, and that Airbnb will fire me now that they see I've posted this. Neither of those statements are true.

It's explicitly illegal under the National Labor Relations Act to fire workers for discussing their compensations, and it has been illegal in American law since 1935. This kind of policy is known as &ldquo;Pay Secrecy,&rdquo; and such policies have been repeatedly struck down by courts.

See: [Pay Secrecy Policies at Work are Often Illegal and Misunderstood](http://www.npr.org/2014/04/13/301989789/pay-secrecy-policies-at-work-often-illegal-and-misunderstoo).

And yet, pay secrecy is considered the norm in American culture.

There was a time in American history when income tax records were in the public domain. Even now, there are many cultures in which talking about your compensation is not at all considered wrong or disrespectful. Rather, it's seen as an important part of creating a transparent society.

Pay secrecy is an easy fallback, because talking about social inequality and pay differentials is uncomfortable. It's especially uncomfortable in American culture, where your salary often serves as a signal of your social status.

But pay secrecy carries with it a lot of costs. It can hide gender and racial discrimination, systemic exploitation, and nepotism. It's easy to sweep these problems under the rug and not want to look at them. And for what it's worth, I have a lot of respect to Airbnb for openly working toward solving these problems in the culture they're building.

These are complicated problems. I don't have all the answers. But because I am committed to effective altruism and publicly earning-to-give, I will continue to be open every year about how much I donate (and by association, how much I earn), insofar as it's possible.

(For further reading, check out [Your Coworkers Should Know Your Salary](https://hbr.org/ideacast/2016/03/your-coworkers-should-know-your-salary), published in the Harvard Business Review. Also, [my response to a commenter on how disclosing my salary might be unwise or affect colleagues at Airbnb](https://haseebq.com/farewell-app-academy-hello-airbnb-part-ii/#comment-2738).)

The second thing I want to say is that for some reason, many people are drawing the conclusion that I primarily got a job at Airbnb by being really good at negotiating, or gaming the system, or something like that.

**If you have ever done a software engineering interview, you would know that this is completely absurd.** There is no way to negotiate or charm someone into passing a software engineering interview. Much less 8 of them.

If you don't know the ins and outs of object-oriented programming, database design, asymptotic analysis, binary search trees, or how to improve the cache efficiency of an algorithm, then you're not going to pass a computer science-heavy interview at a top company. You don't even have a shot at it.

The moral of my story is **not** &ldquo;get really good at negotiating and you'll get a great job.&rdquo; Negotiating is important, and I certainly encourage everyone to negotiate!

But first, get good at the thing you're doing. Then worry about negotiating.

I moved to San Francisco from Austin, Texas about a year ago because I decided I was going to [earn-to-give](https://haseebq.com/why-ive-decided-to-devote-my-career-to-earning-to-give/). Since then I've been relentlessly trying to build a new career for myself, so I could earn more and donate more to charity.

Entering into App Academy, barely knowing the basics of Ruby, I came into the office and grinded every day, spending 80+ hour weeks just coding and studying. I'd come in at 9AM in the morning and leave around midnight, 7 days a week, sleeping in a bunk bed in SOMA in a 200 square feet shared room.

It's certainly true that I probably have a mind that's well-suited for coding. But it's also true that I outworked almost everyone who was in my cohort. And when I was hired by App Academy to help teach the course, I continued working as hard as I could to get good at this.

I still stayed late in the evenings, I still came into the office on weekends alongside the students just to continue coding and learning more. I started an algorithms study group in the evenings where I taught students new algorithms that I had read about, and wrote specs and instructions to guide them through the implementation. I took over our entire algorithms curriculum and taught well over 100 students the basics of data structures and algorithms.

And of course, I was scared that none of this would matter. That having been an English major, having a non-traditional background, being 26 and too old to transition into tech, competing against 20 year olds who'd been coding since they were 10, I thought I must have no chance.

Thankfully, I was wrong. And I'm very, very lucky that I was wrong, because I was almost right.

So if there's one takeaway I want people to have, it's not &ldquo;here's why it pays to be a master negotiator.&rdquo; I'm going to talk a lot more about negotiation advice in my next blog post, but that's almost a detail compared to the larger point.

The real takeaway should be: *get so good that they can't ignore you.* Because once you are, they won't.

title: How to Break Into the Tech Industry—a Guide to Job Hunting and Tech Interviews
tags: [tech careers]
image: coding-924920_960_720_wtwest.jpg
---

I recently completed a job search for my first role as a software engineer.

Despite having first learned how to code almost a year before, having a background as an English major and former professional poker player, I was able to land a total of 8 offers including Google, Uber, Yelp, and Airbnb (where I ultimately joined). In this three-part blog post I'm going to describe my advice to a job-seeker trying to break into the tech industry.

If you haven't read the story of my job search, [you can read about it here]( https://haseebq.com/farewell-app-academy-hello-airbnb-part-i/). It provides some of the backdrop for this post.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DgcI0mQXATI/">[video]</div>

First, several caveats.

I have a weird background, but make no mistake&mdash;I both worked my ass off and got very lucky. When I got my job offers, I was working as an instructor and Director of Product of App Academy, and had been studying (and teaching) this stuff for a little under a year.

In light of that, some people have interpreted this as a &ldquo;get rich quick&rdquo; sort of thing. It's not. It's more of a a &ldquo;go into a cave for six months and hopefully get a job when you emerge&rdquo; sort of thing. Subtle difference, but an important one.

Note that my advice here draws not just from my own experience, but also from the advice of many others. It also comes from observing the job searches of 200+ App Academy students breaking into the tech industry.

That said, take all of my advice with a grain of salt. There are people out there who are much more successful than I, and who know much more about this domain. So if you find there's some aspect of my advice that seems flat-out wrong or contradicted by others, defer to your own judgment.

I entered into tech so that I could [earn-to-give](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earning_to_give). My hope is that in supplying this advice, I will encourage and enable others to do the same.

I've broken this up into three parts: getting interviews, the interview process, and negotiating. This post will cover the first two parts, and I'll conclude with a lot of advice about the negotiation process in a subsequent post.

Note: this advice will be primarily geared toward the software engineer market in the Bay Area, but a lot of the advice will be generally applicable. When I mention &ldquo;engineering,&rdquo; just substitute your own field. Though the details might be different, the underlying dynamics are largely the same.

I hope you find this post helpful in your own job search.

<h2 id="part1">Part 1: Job Hunting</h2>

First and foremost, job hunting is a numbers game. You must have faith in the numbers.

If I told you that you have a 4% chance of getting an offer from any application, that might seem dishearteningly low. But mathematically that means that 50 such applications will give you an 87% chance of getting at least one job offer.

And yet, any given application is almost certainly not going to be the one that ends up turning into an offer.

That's okay. Expect those dynamics. It's weird and counterintuitive, but you should probably expect the company that ultimately gives you an offer to seem like a long shot. This is because almost every application will seem like a long shot.

Be comfortable with that. Trust in the law of large numbers.

This applies to networking, raw applications, even to phone screens and on-sites.

### Networking

Networking is probably the highest leverage activity in getting job offers.

Networking sounds intimidating. But I promise you, at its heart, it's pretty simple.

Just buy everyone coffee.

And when I say everyone, I mean everyone who works at a tech company.

Every time you meet someone in tech, and I mean anyone at all, you should tell them, &ldquo;Hey, that's really cool. I'm actually trying to get a job as a software engineer. I don't know very much about [the thing you do]. I'd love to buy you coffee and pick your brain about it. Are you free sometime this week around [time]?&rdquo;

Buy tons and tons of coffee for people. Do it religiously and have no shame about it. I don't care if you can't afford it. Go broke inviting people to coffee.

In fact, if you go broke, let me know and I'll fund your coffee dates until you land an awesome job and can pay me back.

How do you meet tech people in the first place? Go to [meetups](https://meetup.com). Go to local events. Go to developer conferences. Go to house parties. (Techies are normal people, and people are everywhere.)

Get creative. @Message people on Twitter. Cold-email them (specific people, not companies). Don't be creepy, but it's totally okay to reach out to people out of the blue, learn about them online, and ask directly if you can buy them coffee.

Most importantly, *plumb your network*. Chances are, you have friends or friends of friends who already work at tech companies. You're just not paying attention.

Okay.

So now you've got a bunch of coffee dates lined up with all these random people who work for tech companies. Some of them might be engineers, or managers, operations, designers, customer support, salespeople. Doesn't matter. Meet anyone and everyone.

Once you've sat someone down for coffee, it's time for an **[informational interview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informational_interview)**.

### Informational Interviewing

Here's what you do in an informational interview.

First, learn everything and anything you can about this person. Learn everything you can about their company. Learn everything you can about the industry or technology they work with.

Notice I didn't say &ldquo;ask for a job.&rdquo; **Don't ask for a job.** This is not about you asking for a job. This is about everything other than you asking for a job.

Get to know them! Get to know their company! Learn more about what they do and why it's important. Ask things you really want to know.

They should be doing most of the talking, otherwise you're doing it wrong. Shut up and ask more questions.

Chances are, if you shut up for long enough, they'll be curious about you and want to know what you're doing. Tell them your story. Tell them about who you are, what brought you here, and why you want a job as a software engineer.

At the end of the conversation, go for the close&mdash;which, most of the time, is not to ask for a job referral. **Do not ask for a referral unless they bring it up.** Rather, ask them: &ldquo;who else do you know who'd be a good person for me to talk to?&rdquo; Tell them you want to learn more about front-end development, or cryptography, or iOS, or whatever you were asking them questions about.

You *were* asking them questions, right?

If they can't think of anyone to pass you along to, ask them if they know any other engineers anywhere you could talk to. Or anyone at all who works at another tech company you're interested in. Whatever it is, get contacts for more people to get introduced to. Every conversation should lead to at least one more contact.

Then, just keep following this chain. Schedule more coffee dates, ask more questions, get more contacts. Go through all of it without asking for any unsolicited referrals.

This might seem weird. But studies have shown that this is the most effective way to get a job. And ultimately, it's the most effective way to generate referrals outside of your network.

Why does this work?

It works because people **hate it** when you ask them for a job.

Give you a job? Why? They don't know you. Why would they give you a job? Why would they even waste their time on you?

The power of informational interviewing is that instead of making it about you, *you make it about them*. People like to talk about themselves. They like to teach others. They want to help. But they don't want to be pestered by strangers for favors.

If you keep doing this, people will see your curiosity and your genuineness. They'll believe in your story, and *they will want to refer you*. By not pressuring people to recommend you, you will make them want to do so&mdash;or, at the very least, become an ally in your journey.

The reality is, most people *can't* refer you. This is because their company might be too small to hire junior devs, or they might not need people with your skillset, or they might have overhired for the quarter, or, believe it or not, their company could just be secretly failing and not have any money.

That's okay.

If you do this enough times, someone will eventually float the idea: &ldquo;I could refer you if you want.&rdquo;

If they say this, graciously ask them if they'd be comfortable doing so. They'll then say yes. Now say &ldquo;golly gee, that would be swell.&rdquo; Then follow up with them over e-mail, thank them, and send them your resume. Congrats, you've just landed yourself a referral.

See? That wasn't so hard.

Now keep them posted on your progress through their company's pipeline. Don't hesitate to also ask them for further advice.

Oh, and, before you leave that coffee date, still ask them for more contacts. I mean it. The chain stops for no one.

### Getting the Chain Started

But how do you start the chain?

Chances are, you already have contacts in the tech industry. Even if you think you don't, you probably do. Go scour your LinkedIn, your Facebook, ask your family, talk to people you kinda knew in high school. Nothing is off limits.

Make a spreadsheet of every single person you know who works for a tech company. Mark down what company they work for, and what their role is at that company.

Then sort all of your contacts by company, and then by role. You should reach out to your most relevant contact at every single company on your list (an engineer is more relevant than someone in operations, etc).

**Reach out to every single one.**

Invite them to coffee, lunch, dinner, whatever. Always buy. Farm them for referrals and further contacts. If you have a strong network, this is likely to be the most powerful source of leads for you.

This is great, because unless you have a stellar resume (which I assume you don't because you're bothering to read this guide), referrals are going to be an order of magnitude more impactful than raw applications. This is especially true at top companies.

So keep your funnel healthy. Keep scheduling coffee dates. Keep networking, even if you're mid-way through your job search. I didn't stop meeting with people until I had about 4 offers, and even then I still reached out to people at new companies I was interested in.

### Resumes and Cover Letter

I'm not going to offer a lot of specific advice here, because there's so much to say and it's so individual to your background and experience. [Scour](https://www.resumonk.com/blog/dear-software-engineer-this-is-why-your-resume-was-rejected/) [the](https://www.resumonk.com/resume-examples/software-engineer-resume-examples/software-engineer-sample-resume-%231) [internet](https://jsonresume.org/schema/) for resources. I'd strongly recommend getting your resume reviewed by someone who knows what they're doing.

Resume short version: keep your resume to one page, always. Highlight anything that sounds kinda math-y or technical. Measure everything in terms of impact, don't just describe your responsibilities. Make your resume pretty, especially if you're claiming to be a front-end or full-stack developer. Don't use Arial or Times New Roman. A little bit of design effort will go a long way. [Never, ever have typos](http://blog.alinelerner.com/lessons-from-a-years-worth-of-hiring-data/).

Some people read cover letters, some people don't. You usually need to write one, and you'll likely end up coming up with a script that you adapt. Always personalize them&mdash;try to find some reason why you like the company's mission or find their work interesting. Keep it short, and minimize the cruft. If you need more advice, there's no shortage out there on the internet for cover letter advice.

### Job Platforms

Get on all the job hiring platforms. The first job offers I got were from [TripleByte](https://triplebyte.com), which I cannot recommend highly enough for software engineers.

Also set up a profile on [AngelList](http://angel.co), [WhiteTruffle](https://www.whitetruffle.com/), [SmartHires](https://www.smarthires.io/), and all the rest. Apply to [Hired](https://hired.com). Clean up your LinkedIn and Github profiles. Get your projects up and README'd and pretty.

Even if some of these platforms reject you or you don't get any bites, they're enormous return on investment for the time you'll spend.

### Mass Applying

Referrals and job platforms are unequivocally higher-yield strategies, but you shouldn't ignore raw applications. This is especially true if you have a strong resume, as you're likely to have a higher reply rate. Raw applications are low investment, so you might as well pump them out in your free time and maximize the number of potential bites. They are also the primary way I've seen most App Academy students get jobs, so they certainly work. But they require more volume.

I recommend most people mix in some mass applying into their strategy.

You should pre-commit to a number of companies to apply to per day.

Mass applying to companies is really mind-numbing. It's easy to lose focus. So structure your time and set goals for yourself. Apply to batches of companies in 45-minute sprints. Use [Pomodoros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) to keep yourself on point and accountable.

### Company Size

From my observations, small-medium size companies are more likely to take a chance on a raw application.

Large and prestigious companies tend to have rigid resume review processes, and are more likely to trash your resume if it's not studded with exciting phrases like &ldquo;Stanford PhD&rdquo; or &ldquo;literally a superhero.&rdquo;

Tiny companies are hit-or-miss.

Shoot for unsexy companies. You're much more likely to get an interview, and at this stage, getting interview experience under your belt is ultimately what matters.

Understand: just having your first offer matters much more than where the offer is from. Even if the offer is from a company you're not excited about, you can easily leverage it up to a company you want more. More on this later when we talk about negotiation.

### Study, study, study

This is perhaps the most important piece, and where a lot of the hustle comes in. You need to study your ass off. Your study habits are one of the chief determinants of your performance in interviews (not to mention your performance in your subsequent job).

You're trying to break into this field, so break in!

Below, I'm going to give my general advice to someone aiming for a role as a full-stack or back-end developer. If you want to get a job doing front-end development, game development, embedded systems, or anything sufficiently specialized, you should look up more specific advice for those fields.

This is the preparation that I personally used. My approach to studying has been informed by my knowledge of performance psychology and by the science of learning. But your mileage may vary.

I'm going to assume you already know how to program. If you don't at all, [read this instead as a first step](https://haseebq.com/cracking-the-coding-bootcamp-the-definitive-guide/).

I should also note that the following advice is strongly tailored toward interviews at larger, more prestigious companies. At smaller companies, your interview is less likely to consist of abstract algorithms problems. You may have to do raw coding exercises, fix a bug in production code, or build a small semi-practical system. It's also more likely you'll be asked questions about specific languages or frameworks. I ran into a few of these interviews, but only at smaller companies. Adjust your study plan accordingly.

Disclaimer: a common refrain in tech is that &ldquo;programming interviews are broken.&rdquo; I agree. I think standard tech interviews are poor predictors of software engineering ability. But like any good hacker, I designed this advice to be a reverse-engineering of the standard programming interview. Take it for what it is, and no more.

### General Study Strategy

First, a high-level roadmap.

Watch the [Princeton Coursera course on algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI) (by Robert Sedgewick), mostly up until Dijkstra's algorithm and not much more than that. Try to follow along and code as you go. You don't need to implement things in Java unless you already know Java.

Read [The Algorithm Design Manual](http://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1462241467&sr=8-1&keywords=algorithm+design+manual+skiena&tag=charity48-20) for general algorithms and data structures background. Go through most of it. (You can skip the giant appendix about specific algorithmic topics).

Buy [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Programming/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1462241515&sr=8-1&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview&tag=charity48-20). We'll be using this as a repository of coding problems and solutions.

Listen regularly to podcasts about software like [Software Engineering Daily](http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/podcast/) or [The Bike Shed](http://bikeshed.fm/). Read [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). There's a lot of stuff you won't understand, but that's okay. Just soak it in. Over time, this will give you some familiarity with modern web stacks, current trends, and how developers talk.

For system design and architecture, I recommend reading through [HiredInTech](http://www.hiredintech.com/system-design) and reading a bunch of the top blog posts on [High Scalability](http://highscalability.com/all-time-favorites/) (appears to be down at the time of posting). There's also a massive [Github repo of resources](https://github.com/checkcheckzz/system-design-interview) you can check out specifically for systems design interviews.

If you already know a programming language, do your practicing in whatever language you know best. Interviewers won't care. If you have a choice among languages, prefer expressive scripting languages like Ruby, Python, JavaScript, etc. More on this later when we talk about interview advice.

Object oriented design and code organization are very important concepts, and they'll come up in interviews. Unfortunately, there's pretty much no way to learn them other than by just writing lots of well-structured programs, and getting critiques and code reviews.

If you have no programming background at all, this is one of the places where a (good) coding bootcamp helps tremendously. They will give you a lot of experience just writing programs and being critiqued on your coding style. But there are always online communities where you can find substitutes, such as on [Stack Exchange](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/).

If you're struggling to understand a concept in a book or on Wikipedia, look up Youtube videos of people explaining it in different ways until you get it. I've found this strategy amazingly effective.

Ask human beings for help when you're struggling. If you don't know anyone, get on StackOverflow or find a good IRC channel for the language you're working in. Be a burden on others. Ask quickly and unashamedly. You have my permission.

If you're working on an algorithms problem (such as out of CTCI) and can't figure it out, spend no more than 20-30 minutes without making progress. Just go look up the answer. Contrary to popular belief, most struggling past 30 minutes is pointless.

Some people will disagree with this.

Screw those people.

That said, if you find up having to look up the answer to more than 2/3rds of problems, your problem set is too hard and you need to downgrade.

But banging your head against a wall or staring blankly at code is a waste of time. For code/algorithms problems, you very much want to maximize the density of learning per hour.

Any time you look up the answer to a coding problem, try to understand the solution. Walk through it with a debugger if it's particularly mysterious. Read multiple explanations of why it works.

Then&mdash;and this is **extremely** important&mdash;if you didn't solve the problem completely on your own, treat the problem as though you never solved it at all. Put it back into your rotation of problems. Mark it as something you need to try again from scratch. Wait at least a day, and try to solve it fresh. If you fail, rinse and repeat ad infinitum.

And finally, structure the hell out of your learning. Make a schedule. Know exactly when you're going to be working on this stuff, when you're going to take breaks, when you're going to go to lunch, etc. Build flexibility into your schedule, but have clear goals for how many hours a day you'll spend studying.

That's most of my general studying advice. Now here's the specific study guide I'd recommend.

### Programming Interview Study Guide

First and foremost, work through the Princeton algorithms course. You should follow along and implement as much as you can. Along the way, also implement all these major data structures. (Many of these are not explicitly covered in the course&mdash;implement them on your own).

* Linked List
* [Dynamic array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array), implemented with a [ring buffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer) (use a statically sized array underneath the hood)
* Hash set
* [Hash map (with chaining)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#Separate_chaining_with_linked_lists)
* Binary heap (without decrease-key; know that [Fibonacci heaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_heap) exist and know their guarantees)
* Binary search tree (doesn't need to be self-balancing; know that [self-balancing trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_binary_search_tree#Implementations) exist and know their guarantees)
* Prefix tree (a.k.a. trie)
* Suffix tree (don't worry about compression, just build a dumb version; know that [Ukkonen's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukkonen%27s_algorithm) exists and learn its guarantees)
* An object-oriented [adjacency list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list) for graphs

Know all of the time complexities for their basic operations. It helps to visually intuit them. Look at images. Draw them out on paper/whiteboard.

Once you've gotten all of those out of the way, implement this subset of the most common algorithms:

* Binary search (implement it both iteratively and recursively)
* Randomized quicksort (pay extra attention to the partition subroutine, as it's useful in a lot of places)
* Mergesort
* Breadth-first search in a graph
* Depth-first search in a graph (augment it to detect cycles)
* Tree traversals (pre-order, in-order, post-order)
* Topological sort (using [Tarjan's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#Depth-first_search))
* Dijkstra's algorithm ([without decrease-key](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9255620/why-does-dijkstras-algorithm-use-decrease-key))
* Longest common subsequence (using dynamic programming with matrices)
* Knapsack problem (also dynamic programming)

Know the time complexities and space complexities of all of these algorithms ([cheat-sheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)). Know the difference between [amortized, average](http://stackoverflow.com/a/7335098), and worst-case time guarantees.

Do at least one or two problems where you BFS or DFS through a matrix.

Once you finish these you should have a decent grounding in algorithms and data structures. Read through the entirety of *Algorithm Design Manual* to solidify your understanding. Implement anything that you find sufficiently interesting.

A few points of interest: learn about heap sort, but don't bother coding it. Know that it's O(1) space but practically very slow due to cache-inefficiency. Learn about quickselect and median-of-medians. Code them if you want.

Learn the basics of bit manipulation. Be able to explain what AND, OR, and XOR do. Know what a signed integer is. Know that there are 8 bits in a byte. Know what assembly is (from a high level), and get a sense of the basic operations that hardware exposes. [This awesome video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZUDEaLa5Nw) about the inner workings of the original Game Boy covers just about all you need to know.

Learn about SQL databases. Learn how to design a SQL database schema; it comes up in interviews often. Read about ACID, the CAP theorem, and BASE (you don't need to memorize the terms, just understand the concepts at a high level.) Understand why joins can become unscalable. Learn the basics of [NoSQL databases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI_g07C_Q5I).

Read about caches and cache efficiency. Know what a cache miss is. Know that reading from registers is lightning-fast, reading from the various caches is pretty fast, reading from memory is slow, and that reading from the hard disk is abysmally slow.

Read how to implement an LRU cache, and then actually write one that gets and sets in worst-case O(1) time. This is a weirdly common interview problem.

[Learn what happens when you type a URL into your browser and press enter](http://igoro.com/archive/what-really-happens-when-you-navigate-to-a-url/comment-page-3/). Be comfortable talking about DNS lookups, the request-response cycle, HTTP verbs, TCP vs UDP, and how cookies work. Shows up all the time in interviews.

Learn the standard ways to speed up a slow website. This includes a lot of things like adding database indices to optimize common queries, better caching, loading front-end assets from a CDN, cleaning up zombie listeners, etc. Also an interview classic, pretty rabbit-holey.

(These last two are obviously web development specific.)

Once you've covered those, you now have most of the grounding you need. You should be ready to start interview circuit training.

(If you already have a background in CS, I'd probably start here.)

### Interview Circuit Training

First, work through the first 3 problems on every relevant section of *Cracking the Coding Interview*. (That is, skip sections like Java or C++ if you don't know those languages, skip testing, skip concurrency unless you have experience writing concurrent programs. Do read about it though.)

Write out your solutions in code. Make sure they work. Check edge cases.

After you've written a good 30+ solutions, stop coding every single solution. By now you should have some solid coding practice, and you should be developing your high-level intuition how to determine the optimal approach to a problem. The rest is pattern recognition.

Continue working through the rest of *Cracking the Coding Interview*. But from here on out, instead of actually writing code, just write a high-level description of the algorithm you'd use to solve the problem.

Here's an example of what I mean: &ldquo;First sort the array, then repeatedly binary search through it on each subsequent query. This should take nlog(n) pre-processing and log(n) for each query.&rdquo;

That's enough detail. Once you've written your high-level solution, check it against the solution in the book. If your solution is suboptimal, write a description of the optimal solution. Make sure it makes sense to you. If it even *slightly* doesn't make sense and you're not confident you could write the code, then code it up, test for edge cases, etc.

With this workflow, you should be coding only a small percentage of the remaining problems. You should be able to work through many more problems a day now.

Make sure you have your solutions collected into files so that you can review them easily. In your solutions files, you should also have the problem statement along with any solution you have written/described.

Whenever you review them (which you should at weekly intervals), here's how you should review: read the problem statement only, decide how you'd solve the problem in your head, and then check it against the algorithm you have written down. Again, reaffirm to yourself why the correct answer is correct.

Once you make it through the entire book, spend the remainder of your study time grinding problems on [LeetCode](http://leetcode.com).

LeetCode is an online coding platform like HackerRank or CodeWars that gives you a problem statement and lets you write code against test cases.

I recommend LeetCode particularly because it has the most accurate problem set I've seen for what most algorithms interviews are like. It also has an awesome feature that it tags programming problems by companies where the problem was asked. (If the company has fewer than 2000 employees, then it's unlikely to be tagged anywhere.)

So any time you have an interview at a big company, do every single problem that company is tagged with on LeetCode. You have to pay for a subscription to see the tags, but it's worth it.

GlassDoor is also a good source of company-specific problems to grind on. (You can also try CareerCup, but their accuracy tends to be a bit more dubious.)

After all that, there's one last piece that's missing&mdash;actual interview practice. One of the chief principles of learning is *practice like performance*. That is, make the way you practice as close to the actual performance as possible. In this case, the actual performance will be standing in front of a whiteboard and getting verbally interviewed by someone.

Practice for it.

Find someone to mock-interview you in front of a whiteboard (and reciprocate for them afterward). Have them ask you questions you've never seen before. Practice all of your interviewing skills, including introducing yourself, clarifying the problem, making jokes, everything that you plan to do in a real interview. Treat it as though it's the real thing. Be willing to struggle and look stupid. Don't let yourself break character.

This is also really the only way to practice architecture-oriented interviews. Have your interviewer ask you about the request-response cycle or how you'd architect Twitter, or other standard interview favorites.

A great resource is [interviewing.io](http://interviewing.io/), which allows you to anonymously interview and get interviewed by other people and practice programming problems. They're in private beta right now, but check them out.

If you actually implement every part of this workflow, you should become an algorithms beast within a few months. Your performance on a coding interview will be comparable if not superior to the average CS graduate.

There's nothing magical about any of this. It's all just practice. All of the information you need to pass a coding interview is out there, freely available. It's up to you to put the time in.

Okay.

You're clearly awesome at algorithms now, so let's keep going.

### Staying the Path

Job searching is hard. Once you start applying to companies, you're going to get many, many rejections.

Struggling for months and getting rejected everywhere is deeply demoralizing.

It's going to feel like it's your fault. It's going to feel like something is wrong with you.

That's exactly how my job search began. The same is true for many people I know who landed awesome jobs. Almost everyone goes through this.

There are a couple stories I like to share with App Academy students.

I once worked with an App Academy student who didn't have a degree; he'd dropped out of college. He was job searching for 11 months and had submitted hundreds of applications. He was ready to completely give up on ever finding a job. But with some support and coaching, he was able to get his first offer at a startup. After some negotiating, that offer ended up being the second highest offer any student has ever received in App Academy history.

Another student I worked with had a similar story. 11 months of nothing but rejections after hundreds of applications. After getting some support, he finally received his first and only offer, and it was from Uber. He's still working there.

The moral of this story is: hang in there. Keep grinding. Remember that it's a numbers game. Keep putting yourself out there, and most importantly, keep taking care of yourself.

The simple stuff is important. It'll sound stupid, but focus on self-care before anything else in the job search.

Do things that de-stress you, whether that be meditation, taking baths, playing video games, whatever. Spend time with friends. Eat good, real food.

Make sure you're sleeping. The marginal hour spent sleeping is almost always more useful than the marginal hour spent working.

Get regular exercise, even if you don't want to and hate everything about it. Countless studies have shown that exercise is basically a panacea. It boosts personal well-being more than any other psychological intervention, including anti-depressants.

Depression will creep up on you.

If it does, notice that it's there. Talk to people about it. Don't be ashamed. Fight it actively. Exercise and Vitamin D are your allies. Spend time outside, in the sun. See a professional if you need it.

But your best defense is structuring your time. Religiously schedule yourself. Know what you should be doing everyday.

In many ways, freedom is your enemy. Let structure be your shelter.

### Mindset

I used to work as a mental coach for professional poker players, as well as other folks in high-stakes professions. A lot of that work has informed my approach to job searching.

Here's my advice on mindset.

First and foremost, treat everything as a learning experience. By that I mean, don't ever go into a phone screen or an onsite interview hoping for a job. Don't hope for anything at all. Just go there to learn, to mess up, to try things out and see what this whole interviewing thing is all about.

I'd almost say&mdash;imagine someone else was invited to this interview, and you're merely their doppelganger. You get to be a fly on the wall, try things out, but you don't really care whether they get hired or not. You're just doing it because it's interesting. And why not get more experience interviewing?

Treat every interview like this. Stop caring about the outcome. Don't hope to get hired at all, just go in there and learn.

This approach will have tremendously beneficial effects for you as a candidate. You won't be so damn nervous or terrified. You'll be less attached to the outcome and won't be crushed if you don't get the job. (Almost never does a candidate pass their first couple interviews, so you should expect that anyway.) And it makes the entire process more fun and easier to actually learn from.

The second big piece of advice is: continually set goals for yourself. But only set goals that are completely in your control.

For example, a goal like &ldquo;I want to have a job offer by January 20th&rdquo; is a terrible goal. It's not up to you. How would you even know if you're making incremental progress toward this? You'll either have a job before then or you won't.

Instead, choose goals about your own behavior. A goal like &ldquo;I want to apply to 4 jobs every weekday,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I want to ask 4 people for coffee dates every week&rdquo; are completely in your control and easy to measure.

The third and final piece of advice is on how to frame your job search. Here's a little parable I used to tell my students.

### Your Number

Imagine that somewhere, in God's Database, is a number. That number is the number of days you're going to have to work your ass off until you find a job.

Everyone has their own number in God's database. Even you.

Let's call your number N.

Every day you spend seriously job searching decrements that N by 1. You don't know what that N is of course. And you'll never know what N is until you finally get your first offer. (Assume God [sanitizes his inputs against SQL injections](https://xkcd.com/327/).)

You don't get to choose your N. Many things affect the size of your N&mdash;your experience, your education, your network, systemic biases in the industry, and some randomness. A shitload of randomness, actually.

Other people will have smaller Ns than you, even though they're not as skilled as you are. That's okay.

Ignore other people. They have it easier, and that's fine. But your N is already decided, and your only job is to whittle that N down.

So treat every day as progress. Whether you get rejected from a company, whether you screw up an interview, whether you get inexplicably lowballed, it doesn't matter. That N is getting lower and lower, and your interviewing skills are getting better and better. Be confident. You're getting closer.

Every single day is progress.

And, lastly&hellip;

### Keep Having Fun

This is really important.

Keep making things. Keep working on projects. Find things that excite you. Learn new technologies, frameworks, algorithms, languages. When someone asks you &ldquo;what are you working on lately?&rdquo; you should have a good answer&mdash;one that excites you.

Work on things that are actually fun. It'll keep you sharp, motivated, and happy.

You're breaking into this industry because you want to program, right?

So keep programming!

----

<h2 id="part2">Part 2: The Interview Process</h2>

Okay. You did all of part 1 and you've got interviews lined up. Great. Now what?

 I'm going to reiterate this again: approach every interview as a learning experience. Stop caring whether you'll get the job or not. The first few times, you'll almost certainly bomb. It's okay. Expect that and roll with it.

Interviewing is a skill, and not a particularly mysterious one. Trust that the more times you do it and the more deliberately you analyze your mistakes, the better you'll get at it.

Don't worry about getting a job. Each interview probably won't be the one that leads to a job. That's okay. Just learn and have fun. You'll perform much better that way.

### The Basics

So your interview is coming up.

If you are uncertain about anything in particular, know that you can ask your recruiter or point of contact at the company. You can ask them things like: What sort of problems will be on the interview? Anything specific I should review? Can I use Python? Will there be any pair programming? Should I bring my own laptop for coding? Will I be able to Google documentation during the interview?

These are all totally fine questions. Nobody will care at all if you ask. I've seen many people agonize over questions like these. Just ask.

Some basics:

At a tech startup in the Bay, dress nicely, but casual. Something like a sweater or button-up and jeans works well. In more conservative markets, wear a dress shirt and slacks. If you're not sure, ask your recruiter. This is in no way a taboo question.

They'll often offer you something to drink. Take it if you want it. Use their bathroom. Do whatever you can to make yourself relaxed.

When you meet your interviewer, say hello, introduce yourself. Relax. Try to remember their name. (No big deal if you don't.)

There's always some ritual to beginning an interview. It's not too complicated.

Your interviewer will walk in the room. Smile. Tell her your name. Shake hands confidently. Look her in the eye.

Adopt relaxed body language. Lean back in your chair. Try not to fidget&mdash;just clasp your hands together if you can't help it.

You're completely fine. This interview is just for practice anyway. Don't analyze yourself. No, it's not weird that your arms are dangling like that.

Ask your interviewer what team she's on and what she's been working on lately. This will get the conversation flowing.

If you're nervous, it's okay to tell them that. If you're eager to get started, it's also okay to tell them that.

### Talking About Yourself

When it comes to talking about yourself, most tech interviews are incredibly formulaic.

Almost every question you'll be asked will be a permutation of one of these four:

* What's your story / walk me through your resume / why'd you leave your last job? (these are essentially the same question)
* Why us?
* Tell me about a challenging bug you faced and how you solved it.
* Tell me about an interesting project you worked on.

The first question is particularly important. Essentially, they want to hear your personal narrative. Your answer will strongly influence their perception of you.

This really just comes down to storytelling. Consider yourself a character in a story, and structure the story with a beginning, middle, and end. There should be inflection points, characterization, and easy to understand motivations. Keep it as short as possible, while preserving color and what makes you interesting. Try not to be negative. Frame your story around seeking challenge and wanting to better yourself, rather than rejecting or disliking things.

You will tell this narrative again and again. If you interview enough, eventually it will congeal into a script. The best way to improve at it is to literally practice it out loud and listen to a recording of it. Also try to get feedback from someone whose judgment you trust, and ask them to be as ruthlessly critical as possible.

For the remaining three questions, you should have have pre-crafted answers. If you're at a loss for stories, it may help to sit down and just brainstorm every relevant story you can remember (for example, every bug you remember working on), and then narrow it down from a larger list.

It's hard to practice this effectively in a vacuum, so this is a good thing to work with someone else on.

Once you've answered all your interviewer's soft questions, they may ask you if you have questions for them. Tell them you'll save your questions until the end of the interview. This will give you more time to for the actual programming part, which is the majority of where you'll be evaluated.

Now let's look at advice for the actual programming interview. This is going to be very whiteboarding-specific, but much of the advice applies to coding on a machine as well.

### How to Approach an Interview Problem

Before you answer any (non-trivial) question, always, always, always repeat back the question in your own words. Make sure you understand exactly what they're asking.

Expect that 10% of the time, you will misunderstand what they're actually asking. If that's the case, when you repeat back the question, they'll clarify. But if you misunderstand and jump straight to working on the wrong problem, they won't correct you for a while.

This is because if you start doing things that make no sense, your interviewer is usually just going to assume that you're incompetent.

This is okay. Your interviewer has a hard job, because most people are incompetent, and it's their job to interview incompetent people.

Thus, if they see you initially do something stupid, they will not charitably assume that you're a smart person who is just having a bad day. That's fine; you'll gradually gain credibility over the course of the interview. But it's important to be mindful of this initial dynamic.

Thus, you should be as explicit as possible in all of your communication. Spell things out in nauseating detail. This will both eliminate any potential miscommunication between you and your interviewer, and will also quickly convince them that you are not incompetent. This is surprisingly important.

Okay, let's move on.

For any non-trivial question, I almost always start by working through a small-medium sized example on the whiteboard. This again confirms that I understand the problem and develops my intuition for how to solve it. It's also worth throwing in some edge cases here to give yourself a sense for why the problem is tricky.

Don't ever jump straight to coding. Even if you think you know the answer, don't jump straight to coding. First, explain your approach in the abstract. If there are problems with your approach, your interviewer will often point them out here; by jumping straight in, your interviewer is more likely to let you hang yourself.

Once you begin mentally working through the problem, try to keep talking. Don't stop moving your mouth. Do your best to let the interviewer know everything that you're thinking at all times. No matter how small or stupid or uncertain the step you're taking in your head, just say it out loud. If you need time to think, say &ldquo;give me a moment to think about this.&rdquo; Then recount the results of your thinking, even if it was unfruitful.

Engineering interviews are as much about communication and thought process as they are about results. You can absolutely pass an interview on communication alone, even if you don't get the optimal answer.

Look at your interviewer. Engage with them. Ask them questions. Make a joke. Don't ask for help, ever. And don't give up.

Don't ever, ever give up. As long as they don't give up on you, you don't give up on yourself. Keep pushing, trying different things, and if you can't think of anywhere productive to go, just explain why everything you can think of won't work.

You'll get way more help, way more leeway, and way more empathy from your interviewer if you follow this advice.

If an efficient solution doesn't immediately jump out at you, go ahead and describe the brute force solution to the problem. You'll almost always get credit for something if you at least enumerate a correct but inefficient solution. You don't have to necessarily code it (depends if they ask you to). It's usually enough to just describe how it works. Then say, &ldquo;So that solves the problem in exponential time. But it's definitely not optimal. Let me see if I can find a more efficient approach.&rdquo; This will also help you grapple with the problem, and may give you a flash of insight on how to solve it efficiently.

A good heuristic for finding a brute-force solution is asking yourself: what's the algorithm that my brain uses to try to solve this problem if I wanted to solve it by hand?

Don't be afraid of looking stupid. It's okay to be wrong. It's okay to ask questions if you don't know what something means. Take it in stride and laugh about it. At almost all of the interviews where I received an offer, I botched at least one question. Don't let it ruffle you.

That said, if you think you know what something means but you're not 100% sure, trust your intuition. You'll usually be right. If you're not, it's okay to be corrected.

### Correcting your Interviewer

Sometimes you might think your interviewer is wrong about something.

Your interviewer will definitely be sometimes wrong. But it's much, much, much more likely that you'll be the one who's wrong. Think about it: you're stressed out of your mind and coding for dear life, while your interviewer is sitting in a chair and watching the hundredth person this year struggle to solve their favorite pet problem.

As a default, always defer to your interviewer and assume that you are mistaken. Never get defensive. Figure out why you're wrong. If you are in fact right, you should be able to prove it methodically.

Okay, so you've talked everything to death, now you're ready to write code. First, say: &ldquo;Would you like me to code this up?&rdquo;

If your interviewer has any final misgivings about your approach, this gives them an opportunity to stop you. They may also sometimes stop you if your algorithm is acceptable but they want you to find a more optimal approach.

But usually they'll say yes. So let's start writing code.

### Writing Code

Just kidding. You're not ready to code yet.

Before you write anything, first verbally verify your assumptions about the input. May I assume I never get negative inputs? May I assume these are all 64-bit integers? May I assume everything in this input string is ASCII-encoded? May I assume that my input is a hash map, formatted like so? Should I raise an error for an invalid input? How should this function behave if the input is a float?

Some of the time, your interviewer will be satisfied with this attention to detail and will allow you to hand-wave some error handling for invalid inputs. But if you don't mention it at all, they might later ask you &ldquo;ah, but what if you get a negative integer?&rdquo; Then you'll have to erase something and squeeze in a line for error handling and waste more time.

You're almost ready to code now. Announce the language you're going to write this in. You should strongly prefer a dynamically typed language with a rich standard library like Ruby or Python. Choosing a language like Java or C++ will only handicap you in how long it takes to express the same algorithm. You will not be graded on how hardcore of a programmer you are, only on whether you solved the problem in the allotted time.

Now is also the time to mention if there are any special data structures or libraries you need. It's totally cool to say &ldquo;May I assume that I have a prefix tree?&rdquo; even if you don't know of a prefix tree library in your language. It's okay to just declare the API as you go: &ldquo;I'm going to assume this heap has a .pop_min method.&rdquo;

And now it's time to code.

Always start at the top left corner of the board. Board management is surprisingly important in whiteboarding interviews. Erase stuff that's in your way and give yourself as much room as possible for the code.

More board management advice: don't close blocks (whether curly braces or *if* blocks) until you actually get to them. Closing them early will make things messy if you have to then squeeze in unexpected lines of code or do a lot of erasing.

As a general habit, add plenty of white space around lines. It's very, very common to have to add extra lines somewhere in a function. The more breathing room you leave, the easier that will be.

If you don't remember the exact name of a method, your interviewer won't care most of the time. Don't stress about it. Just come up with a reasonably close-enough name for it. If they ask what it does, just say: &ldquo;I could be mistaken about the name here, but this method creates an inverted version of a hash map so the unique values now point to their keys.&rdquo; Most interviewers will be satisfied with that.

Name your variables descriptively, but keep them short. It's going to suck to write long variable names repeatedly without autocomplete.

As you're writing, abstract away as much logic as you can into helper functions. This is a tremendously useful whiteboarding optimization.

Just invoke the helper functions as you go and don't feel the need to write their declarations immediately. Just say: &ldquo;I'll write this function afterward, but this just returns a hash table mapping each character in the string to its frequency.&rdquo;

Go ahead and keep working through your main function, and worry about the helpers later. This will keep you in your flow and will make it easier to read and reason about your code.

After you finish and establish the characteristics of your primary function's logic, oftentimes your interviewer will trust that you can write some of the helpers and won't want to watch you code them.

Just say: &ldquo;so this helper function does [blah blah blah]. Do you want me to write this as well?&rdquo; If they say yes, go ahead and write all your helper functions out. But this at least gives them the chance to say no. This optimization alone ended up saving me a lot of time across my interviews.

Finally, once you've finished all of the code, review everything. Just say &ldquo;okay, let me review this now.&rdquo; Read your code from top to bottom and ensure it makes sense. Follow it as though you had a debugger, actually tracing the path and transformations of an input. Fix any obvious mistakes. Then start inspecting for edge cases.

Most common edge cases: the input is null/empty, the input is 0 or size 0, the input is 1 or size 1, or the input contains duplicates. Try to suss out the assumptions you're making and see how they could be violated.

Once you're satisfied that your solution accounts for edge cases, then and only then turn to your interviewer and announce &ldquo;I believe this solves the problem.&rdquo; Make it clear that you believe you're done.

Now go ahead and analyze the algorithm. Announce the time complexity and space complexity of your solution. Talk about any tradeoffs you might be able to make. &ldquo;If you wanted to take O(n^3) time, then you could just memoize all the answers and return them in O(1) time for subsequent queries. But that comes at a big up-front time and space cost.&rdquo;

### Assorted Heuristics

This is kind of dumb, but I thought I'd include this because people seem to find it helpful.

If you're blanking during an interview, try these rules of thumb, roughly in order of usefulness:

1. Try hash maps.
2. If your problem fundamentally breaks down to searching for something, consider binary search.
3. Try sorting your input.
4. Can you break the problem down into sub-problems? Does solving the problem for size (N – 1) make solving it for size N any easier? If so, try to solve recursively and/or with dynamic programming.
5. If you have a lot of strings, try putting them in a prefix tree.
6. Any time you repeatedly have to take the min or max of a dynamic collection, think heaps. (If you don't need to insert random elements, prefer a sorted array.)

Okay, so the interview is finally over. Now it's time to ask your interviewer questions. This part, too, is surprisingly important.

### Grill Your Interviewers

A common trope people throw around is &ldquo;you're interviewing them as much as they're interviewing you.&rdquo; I say if that's true, then put them through the goddamn wringer.

Ask them why they decided to join the company. Ask them what they think the company could improve at. Ask them about a time that they messed up and how it was handled. Ask them how they see themselves growing at this company in the next few years. Ask them what they wish someone would have told them before they joined. Ask them if they ever think about leaving, and if they were to leave, where they would go.

To be clear, these are not necessarily questions about the company. They are questions *about your interviewer*.

I advocate grilling your interviewer for a few reasons:

* Your interviewer is likely representative of the people you'll be working with if you join. You should learn as much as possible about the kind of people who work here.
* It's going to give you a lot more insight into the company than any generic question will.
* It gives you some momentum in the interview. Instead of constantly being on the defensive, by asking tough questions, you get some time to breathe while your interviewer reacts to your questions.
* It's also just more interesting!

That said, you will probably have some burning questions you actually want to ask your specific interviewer, like &ldquo;How did you get into data engineering?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What are your feelings on the company's transition toward service-oriented architecture?&rdquo;

That leads me to my second piece of advice when it comes to grilling interviewers.

Most of the time you won't have snappy, specific questions to ask. So memorize a set of questions and ask them again and again. Not just for different companies&mdash;literally ask successive interviewers at the same company the exact same thing.

Why?

Because for one, interviewers usually solicit questions at the end of an interview. By then there's a good chance you'll be psychologically drained and won't feel like coming up with novel, incisive questions.

(Never, ever, ever say &ldquo;I have no questions.&rdquo; Be interested!)

Second, interviewers don't compare notes on which questions a candidate asked them. So if you have a good set of questions, nobody at the company will know you asked the same questions.

Third, even if they did, they wouldn't care. Good questions are still good questions, and it's worthwhile to hear different people's answers to the same good question. I've learned a lot about different companies' dynamics this way.

### Be Excited

This is the final point I want to make, and it applies to your entire interview process.

Be excited about the company. It's trite, but it makes a huge difference. Be excited to interview. Be excited to learn about what your interviewer does and the prospect of getting to work with them. Tell them how much you like the people you met and that you dig the culture.

Interviewing is surprisingly like dating. Your interviewer is disproportionately more likely to be excited about you if you're excited about them. That positivity will make them more want to work with you, and even go to bat for you when it comes decision time.

Not only that, but excitement is a signal that you actually want to do the job they're hiring you for, and that you're going to work your ass off to do it well. If your interview performance was anywhere near the edge, your excitement may end up pushing you over the finish line.

You'll likely be interviewing at different companies, but you should always talk about what makes this company unique and captivating. If you're not sure, just ask your interviewers&mdash;what makes them love working here? You can then reflect back that answer.

At the same time, you don't want to appear desperate. I liked using the phrase &ldquo;looking for good mutual fit.&rdquo; You want to be discriminating, but you also want to seem winnable if they make you the right offer. If you seem outright disinterested in the company, then they probably won't want to make you an offer even if you pass their technical bar.

Companies do vary significantly in culture. But a lot of &ldquo;culture fit&rdquo; really just comes down to a simple question: would your interviewers actually want to be your colleague?

It's much easier for them to say yes if you sound excited. So make it easy for them.

title: The Myth of the Feel Player

There is a vague and shadowy mythology surrounding the Feel Player. He is a genius of mysterious origins. No one can explain how or why he is good at poker&mdash;not even the Feel Player himself. He is like a mathematical prodigy hailing from a tiny, illiterate village in India, or a low-born squire who pulls a mythical sword from its pedestal. He is a fluke, an exception. He is not supposed to be great, yet somehow he is.

Perhaps it is his impossibility that so excites us. Or perhaps it is the dream that he offers&mdash;that we, too, could be great like him. By telling ourselves the story of the Feel Player, we drop our business cards into an imaginary lottery. What, in the end, could be more democratic, more reassuring, more feel-good than the possibility of the Feel Player?

I am here to assure you, gentle reader, that the notion of a Feel Player is a myth.

In this article, we will examine the concept of a Feel Player, what it can tell us about cognition and unconscious competence, how Feel Players evolve (or don't), and why the concept of the Feel Player can be so detrimental to students of poker.

First, let's try to begin, unlike the Feel Player, unsensationally&mdash;what, properly defined, is this mysterious player?

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VfCSx5641U4">[video]</div>

## What is a Feel Player?

The hallmark of the Feel Player is in the way he justifies his plays. When you ask a Feel Player why he made a bluff, he'll answer, &ldquo;it felt right.&rdquo; When you ask him why he folded the second-nuts, he'll say, &ldquo;I felt like he had it.&rdquo; The origins of his answers are a mystery. Where the rest of us invoke combinatorials, betting logics and notes we've taken, the Feel Player invokes the god in his head.

But somehow&mdash;awesomely&mdash;the god in his head is usually right.

There are many poker players who have, for me, embodied the myth of the Feel Player. Personally, I have always seen Ilari Sahamies (Ziigmund) as the foremost exemplar of this phenomenon. Of course, there are many others. And while I have seen many Feel Players come and go, few have lasted the test of time.

There is a common belief is that Feel Players have a different and unique style of thinking. I.e., some players are analytical and theory-heavy, whereas others are intuitive and feel-heavy. &ldquo;Feel&rdquo; is seen as merely a thinking style, like the difference between auditory and visual learning.

&ldquo;Feel&rdquo;, then, is shorthand for intuition&mdash;pure unconscious competence. We've talked about this concept before in previous chapters, but let's look at it in a little more detail.

## Feel and Consciousness

As previously stated, there are four phases of learning in the process of mastering any skill:

1. unconscious incompetence (inattentively being bad)
2. conscious incompetence (attentively being bad)
3. conscious competence (attentively being good)
4. unconscious competence (inattentively being good)

In a simple task, you can progress uniformly from one stage to the next. But poker is an extremely complex game. Instead of thinking of poker as a single skill to be optimized from stages one to four, we should think of ability in poker as comprising *many* different skills&mdash;innumerably many&mdash;each of which is at a different stage in these phases of learning. Because poker is so intricate and incorporates so many different situations and types of reasoning, even the best players in the world will have some parts of their game that have not passed on to the stage of unconscious competence.

Consider **&ldquo;autopilot&rdquo;**. In poker, what we call autopilot is another way of referring to the entirety of your unconscious competence&mdash;your poker &ldquo;muscle memory,&rdquo; so to speak. When you are autopiloting, you are essentially restricted to only your poker skills that are unconsciously mastered&mdash;skills in the fourth stage of mastery. Everything that is not mastered to that level (that is, skills in which you are only consciously competent) will be suddenly missing from your game. So if, when you autopilot, your flop checkraising game vanishes, this tells you that your flop checkraising game is still not yet mastered to the level of unconscious competence. Although autopiloting is often seen as a bad thing, it is invaluable for elucidating which parts of your game are completely automatic&mdash;and, by implication, which parts are not. So when we are *not* autopiloting&mdash;when we are playing our **A-game**&mdash;there is a thread of conscious chatter that's running through our heads. This conscious thread is what gives us access to all of our consciously competent poker skills. The goal, then, is *not* to remove all of the chatter from your mind. This is somewhat unlike other activities, such as juggling or dancing, in which the goal is to &ldquo;get out of your head&rdquo; and &ldquo;just be in the moment.&rdquo; The chatter we experience when playing good poker is essential for invoking the skills in which we have only conscious competence.

The neurological difference between conscious and unconscious processes is not well understood, but experiments have demonstrated that the difference is real and crucial to managing performance. Consider, for example, driving your car to work in the morning, compared to driving your car on the motorway in a thunderstorm. On a normal day you drive very inattentively, perhaps listening to music, or talking to a passenger. But during a thunderstorm you probably turn the music down, lean forward in your seat, and are fully focused on the task. By fully attending to your driving, you recruit all of the subtlety and attention you can to your handling of the car. Things like fine handling, reactionary decision-making, and adjusting your speed to weather and visibility conditions are skills that most drivers *don't* have unconsciously mastered. We intuitively recognize this, and adjust our concentration levels according to the needs (and dangers) of the task at hand.

But perhaps you might argue that poker is a very mental game&mdash;it's not a physical activity like playing tennis or driving a car. How is it that such a mental game can be automated into our mental muscle memory, such that we don't even have to think about it? One process that explains this is chunking**.** Chunking is the process by which larger and larger patterns of information are condensed or &ldquo;chunked&rdquo; into single mental units. A good example of this is in the assessment of starting hands. The first time you ever played no-limit Hold'em, perhaps you looked at a hand like A7o, and processed it as &ldquo;I have an ace and a seven.&rdquo; Perhaps you considered how each of those cards could facilitate hitting a pair&mdash;a pair of 7s, or a pair of aces, and maybe you figured this to be pretty good. But now, as an experienced poker player who's been dealt thousands of A7's, you treat A7o as not two separate cards, but one distinct &ldquo;chunk&rdquo; of a hand. You think very fluidly and quickly about how A7o does against other chunked hole cards&mdash;A5, AJ, 78, etc.

The more we play poker, the more we are able to chunk bigger and more complex patterns of information into single units. As you continue to gain experience, you will start to chunk flops&mdash;such that Js8s7c will become a flop that you will play so many times, you will no longer analyze it card-by-card, but will see it as one discrete thing. And when the turn comes down 2d, a blank, you will not have to analyze that card separately either, because you know exactly how you're supposed to play with your JTo on Js8s7c+low blank. Once something is chunked, it no longer needs to be consciously analyzed, and hand processing speed increases exponentially. You're not thinking anymore &ldquo;what do I beat and what don't I beat on this board? How many hand combos are ahead of me?&rdquo; but instead, you just unconsciously &ldquo;sense&rdquo; the relative strength of your hand on this board, and play it accordingly. Once a skill becomes unconsciously competent, it is almost always chunked to a high degree. And because chunking requires a great depth of experience, the only way to reach this level of unconscious competence is by putting in thousands of hours and consciously analyzing them so many times that the analysis becomes crystallized in your chunking. Thus, that spot can eventually be dealt with as a single unconscious unit.

So when I ask you, &ldquo;why do you think A83r is a bad board to checkraise?&rdquo; you might not have an immediate answer&mdash;perhaps, for you, you just know this intuitively. It's part of your chunked sense of A83r; you &ldquo;feel&rdquo; it. But if you take a minute to think about it, you can probably retrospectively explain&mdash;&ldquo;well, if I checkraise that board I'm repping very few hands, most Axs I have will just check/call, and he has more big aces if he's raised preflop,&rdquo; and so on.

We all have some of our decisions relegated to &ldquo;feel,&rdquo; but most of us can still reproduce the theory needed to derive them again if needed. Yet according to the popular mythology, the Feel Player cannot do this.

## The Evolution of the Feel Player

So how could such a thing as a Feel Player ever arise? How could someone who doesn't theoretically analyze their hands ever become good at poker?

It's not as unlikely as you might think.

First, let us remember that poker is a **stochastic** game&mdash;that is to say, it's non-deterministic. Poker is stochastic in that it gives *partially random* feedback to your plays. E.g., if you make a *good* checkraise, your feedback might still be negative (the checkraise fails and you get punished) 30% of the time. Not only that, but there's second-level stochasticity&mdash;the checkraise might be good against 80% of players who've given off the same reads your opponent has, and bad against 20%, so even if you've made a bad checkraise against *this* player, one of the 20%, it might be good on average. Add stuff like getting sucked out and coolers, and you can see how poker gives chaotic and unreliable feedback.

But the idea we have is that the Feel Player is *purely responding**to feedback*. He is simply listening to what poker is telling him&mdash;little *yes*'s and *no*'s&mdash;and like someone learning to balance on one foot, he gradually gets better and better, with his body continually nudging him in the right direction. Perhaps this seems a little farfetched to you. Isn't poker too messy for a player like that to ever get good?

Let me provide you with a hypothetical Monte Carlo simulation. Imagine a group of 1,000,000 &ldquo;theory&rdquo; players, and one of 1,000,000 Feel Players. The theory players are, obviously, those who use poker theory to negotiate the game, whereas the Feel Players are learning purely from poker's stochastic feedback. Of course, a lot of those theory players are going to fail; maybe they're not smart enough, or they're too tilty, or just unlucky&mdash;but let's say that only 30% of them succeed as poker players. That gives us 300,000 surviving theory players. For Feel Players, on the other hand, *tons* of them are going to fail&mdash;poker is so random and their learning is so undirected, the vast majority of them will drop off like flies. But given the sheer numbers and the fact that poker might, in its random feedback, nudge some of those players into really good habits, let's say that 0.5% of them succeed. That gives us 5,000 successful Feel Players.

That's a ratio of 1:60 for Feel Players to theory players. That's a pretty lopsided ratio. But it's enough for most people to have run into many of them, and for a couple Feel Players to be prominent among the top 300 players in the world. But the &ldquo;Feel Player&rdquo; seems like a prominent phenomenon; surely there are more than 1:60, you might say.

In fact, Feel Players are overwhelmingly rare at the highest levels&mdash;we just tend to notice them a lot more. It's a sort of availability bias; they're mentally overrepresented. Theory players are everywhere. They're boring and mechanical. But Feel Players are sensational, rare, and fascinating, so we pay more attention to them. We hang on their every word, we watch them in games, and we root for them. Why? Perhaps because they are like us. Feel Players take crazy risks. They tilt. They make plays no one would ordinarily make. Just the idea of being a Feel Player, of thumbing your nose at the meticulous and boring process of poker theorizing&mdash;this is an exciting attitude in and of itself. The Feel Player appears to show us that anyone can win at poker. It doesn't take a genius, or having spent thousands of hours studying the game, or the ability to do GTO simulations or combinatorial calculations. So we follow him. We tell his story. We, in a sense, create the myth of the Feel Player.

## The Luck of the Draw

Now think, how many Feel Players do you really know of? Make a mental list. And of those, how many *are you really sure* are Feel Players, and not just players whose poker theory you don't really know much about? I'd be surprised if you knew of more than five who are still successful.

A Monte Carlo simulation can account for the existence of Feel Players. But this doesn't mean that one should take them seriously. As with any tall tale, the point isn't whether or not it actually happened. The fact is, being a Feel Player is not a reliable way to become good at poker. It's not a learning style, or a way of being. We are better off thinking of Feel Players, rather than as geniuses or heroes, as simply really, really lucky.

It's strange, I know, to call someone who is highly skilled &ldquo;lucky.&rdquo; We reserve that word generally for people who are ostensibly bad. But in fact, if you are looking at the top 0.1% of Feel Players&mdash;the ones who are successful&mdash;their getting conditioned by poker in the exact right way to produce good habits was purely a matter of luck. It was out of their hands. Even though they may now be good, solid, consistent cash game players, they still may have been just as lucky as a first-time fish who binks a bracelet, depending on the EV and unlikelihood of those events. Feel Players have no control over their development. They don't &ldquo;choose&rdquo; to get good. They may *happen* to become good, but if you took 100 simulations of their life, with all of the decisions that they made held constant, they would succeed in only one, whereas a theory player might succeed in 20 of them.

And that is also why Feel Players as a race are going extinct. You don't hear as much about them now as you used to. This is because Feel Players in general have very short lifespans. After all, if your conditioning and learning was mostly random, what makes you think it's going to continue to keep up with evolving games? In that sense, Feel Players are much like comets. They may burn brightly for a time, and that draws our eye to them, but they go out just as fast and foolishly as they arrived. This is not to mention that the chance of a Feel Player reaching the highest levels is becoming more and more unlikely, as poker continues to get harder and more players are employing complex strategies guided by game theory and exploitation. Strategies that you could've stumbled into three years ago and taken a run at high stakes with are now not enough to break even in $2/$4 games.

Poker is changing. The fact that you're reading this article probably means that you're on the right side of that change. It was merely 10 years ago that basic poker conversations we have nowadays would've been scoffed at as reductionistic, nonsensical, or &ldquo;not what the game is about.&rdquo;

Don't get me wrong. I'm not suggesting that intuition is not important, or that &ldquo;feel&rdquo; doesn't play a role in most of our decisions. It absolutely does. There are many things that our unconscious minds are better at processing than our conscious minds will ever be. Theory can only do so much; it is slow, lumbering, and we often have no time to work through the full calculations in a hand before we must make a decision. Further, there are games like PLO, which can become so complex that it's impossible to do EV simulations in many flop scenarios. We are always navigating poker unconsciously, and often &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; out the terrain with our guts before our brains. But we must also remember that, as poker players, we are tasked with the responsibility of doing *everything we possibly can* to become good. Poker, rake, and randomness are all working against us. Nothing is in our favor. So we must enlist every tool at our disposal&mdash;theory being perhaps the strongest. All theory players use feel; without it, they would be uselessly slow. But properly oriented, theory is like the charioteer, directing the raw and wild power of feel.

One of the greatest benefits of theory, after all, is its ability to reduce the stochasticity of poker feedback. Without theory, you might be conditioned not to make that checkraise again&mdash;but with a solid understanding of theory, you may realize that even though this hand gave you a *no*, solid theory will reassure you that it was really a wider *yes* in the long run. Thus, you don't swallow the randomness and noise that poker is feeding you, and instead you shape your game closer to the real mechanics of poker. Feel is like a wild horse, dragging you every which way, and it is up to theory to tame it and keep yourself on course. Thus without theory, your learning is at the mercy of far more chaos (not to mention cognitive biases).

In reality, there are probably no true Feel Players at high stakes anymore. The binary I initially presented is a bit of a fantasy&mdash;rather than theory versus feel, it's really &ldquo;theory and feel,&rdquo; in constant orbit of one another. In reality, every serious, modern-day poker player has *some* idea of theory that's guiding his play. Some, like Ilari perhaps, just have relatively less compared to their peers. Inevitably, these things are hard to quantify, and in truth, a lot of it is probably just perception. Perhaps Ilari is a theory player, and just doesn't seem that way&mdash;or hides it. I would never know. But whoever is or isn't a feel player is beside the point. The point is. feel is not a learning style. Feel is ubiquitous, and necessary for every poker player, and always has been. But it's a cop-out. It's the luck of the draw. It is not a reliable way to become good.

So you know the [first 6 rules](https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/). You've maneuvered through the initial offer conversation, you've lined up counteroffers from other companies, and now it's time to move into the actual negotiating.

Naturally, this is the part where everything goes horribly wrong.

But worry not. Stick with me, and I'm going to make you into a superhuman negotiator. (Or at least an eccentric billionaire negotiator, which is sometimes better?)

Seriously though. In this article I'm going to deep dive on the whole negotiating process, and discuss the final 4 rules on how to negotiate a job offer.

Right. Let's start from the top.

What does it take to be a good negotiator?

Most people think negotiating well is just looking the other person in the eye, appearing confident, and asking for tons of money. But being a good negotiator is a lot more subtle than that.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7hYKw-hL6OM/">[video]</div>

## What Good Negotiators Sound Like

You probably have a friend or family member who's infamous for refusing to take no for an answer. The kind of person who will march into a department store and bullheadedly argue with the management until they get a purchase refunded.

This person seems like they often get what they want. They make you cringe, but perhaps you should try to be more like them.

Rest assured, this person is actually a terrible negotiator. They're good at being difficult and causing a scene, which can sometimes convince a waitress or shift manager to appease them. But this style of negotiating will get you nowhere when negotiating with a business partner (that is, an employer).

A good negotiator is empathetic and collaborative. They don't try to control you or issue ultimatums. Rather, they try to think creatively about how to fulfill both your and their needs.

So when you think of negotiating a job offer, don't imagine haggling over a used car. Think more like negotiating dinner plans with a group of friends, and you'll fare much better.

## Slicing up the cake

Another important difference between good and bad negotiators is that bad negotiators tend to think of a negotiation as a zero-sum game.

Imagine we're negotiating over a cake. In a zero-sum negotiation if I get one more slice, you get one less. Any gain I make comes at your expense.

This seems obviously true with cake, right? So what makes a job negotiation any different?

Ah, but it's not actually true for cake. What if I hate corner pieces and you love them? What if I really like the cherries? What if I prefer to scrape off some of the frosting, but you love extra frosting? What if I'm full and you're starving, but you'll agree to treat me to my favorite cake next time?

Of course, when I posed the question I didn't mention anything about cherries or my feelings on corner pieces. It might seem like I just made shit up.

But this is exactly what good negotiators do. They bend the rules. They question assumptions and ask unexpected questions. They dig to find the core what everyone values and looks for creative ways to widen the terrain of negotiation.

While you were thinking about how to haggle over slices, I'm thinking about how to give both of us more than just half of a cake.

Different parties in a negotiation almost always have different value functions. We may value the *same* things&mdash;we both care about cake, after all. But we we don't value them in exactly the same way, so there's probably a way to give each of us more of what we want.

Most people go into a job negotiation thinking they need to stubbornly haggle over salary like slices of cake. They don't ever stop to ask&mdash;hey, what do I actually value? Why do I value it? What does the company value? Why do they value that?

There are many dimensions in a job negotiation: salary, signing bonus, stock, a year-end or performance bonus, commuter benefits, relocation expenses, equipment, an educational stipend, a childcare stipend, extra vacation time, a later start date, getting a dedicated hour a day to work out or study or meditate or play solitaire. You could choose which team you're assigned to, what your first project will be, what technologies you'll be working with, and sometimes even choose your title.

Maybe you're a frosting person, and the company is more into cherries. You never know if you don't ask.

Hold onto this mindset.

Okay.

Let's pick up the negotiation where we left off. All the offers are in, and recruiters are eagerly awaiting for you to get the ball rolling.

Let's start negotiating.

## Phone vs Email

Your first decision is whether you're going to negotiate over the phone or keep it over e-mail.

Talking on the phone not only signals confidence, but more importantly, it allows you to build a strong relationship with your recruiter.

Talking on the phone enables bantering, telling jokes, and building connection. You want your recruiter to like you, understand you, empathize with you, and want you to succeed. Likewise, you want to care about your recruiter and understand what's motivating them.

The best deals get made between friends. It's hard to make friends over e-mail.

However, if you don't have confidence in your negotiation skills, you should try to push the negotiation to e-mail. Written, asynchronous communication will give you more time to strategize and make it easier to say uncomfortable things without being pressured by a recruiter.

That said, recruiters will always prefer to get you on the phone. It's essentially their home turf. They're also well aware that negotiating is easier over e-mail, and they have little interest in making it easier on you. They'll often be vague about the offer over e-mail and only offer to discuss specific details on the phone.

If you want to stick to email, you have to push back against this. There's no secret to it: just be honest and ask for what you want.

Tell them:

> Hi recruiter, I hope your day is treating you well!
>
> Re: your previous e-mail, I'd prefer to discuss the details of the offer over e-mail. I sometimes get nervous during important phone calls, so discussing the offer over e-mail helps me to keep a clear head and communicate more clearly. I hope this is okay with you. :)

No bullshit, no huff-puffery. Just telling the truth and asking for what you want.

There's tremendous power in honesty and directness. Take advantage of it.

(Also, note how I wrote &ldquo;discuss the details of the offer&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;negotiate.&rdquo; Never describe what you're doing as negotiating&mdash;that sounds immediately adversarial and haggley. Describe it instead as a discussion, and they're less likely to recoil.)

## Having Alternatives

I mentioned before how essential it is to have multiple offers. I'll reiterate again&mdash;it's very, very valuable to have multiple offers.

With other offers on the table, if your negotiation doesn't work out, they know you'll just accept another offer. Your negotiating position suddenly becomes a lot more credible because they know you're willing to walk away.

This effect is strengthened if you get an offer from a prestigious company. And the effect goes through the roof if you have an offer from a company's primary competitor (now they'll really want to poach you from the big bad competitor-corp).

Some of this behavior is stupid tribalism. And some part of it is rational in trying to deprive competitors of talent. Either way, take advantage of it, and be tactical in which companies you aim for.

But what if you don't manage to get any other offers? Does all the negotiating just go out the window?

Not at all. What's important here is not actually having other offers. More specifically, it's in having strong alternatives. Which is why **Rule #6 of negotiating is: have alternatives.**

A negotiation needs stakes. If there were no risk and you knew for sure the other side would sign a contract, what incentive would you have to offer them anything more?

Your alternatives are what give a negotiation its stakes. By signaling your alternatives, you allow your interlocutor to develop a mental model of when and why you'll walk away from the negotiation. Your alternatives also have an anchoring effect on how much the other side thinks you're objectively worth.

In negotiation literature, your best alternative is often referred to as your BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement). Basically, it's what you'd do if you walked away.

I like the term BATNA a lot, mostly because it sounds like a gadget Batman would lob at bad guys.

So what's your BATNA if you don't have other offers? Do you even have one?

Of course you do. Your best alternative might be &ldquo;interview at more companies&rdquo; or &ldquo;go to grad school&rdquo; or &ldquo;stay at your current job&rdquo; or &ldquo;go on sabbatical in Morocco for a few months&rdquo; (as it was for a friend of mine who was deliberating between joining a startup and gallivanting through North Africa).

The point is, you don't need to have another offer to have a strong BATNA. *Your BATNA's strength comes from 1) how strong the other side perceives it to be, and 2) how strong you perceive it to be.*

If your recruiter thinks that going to grad school is an awesome thing to do, then they'll see you as having a very strong alternative, and the stakes of the negotiation will be raised.

But even if they think grad school is ridiculous, if you convince them that you'd be totally happy to go to grad school, then the burden is on them to make this deal more attractive to you than going to grad school.

Thus, *you need to communicate your BATNA*. This doesn't need to be ham-fisted, but you need to make it a background to the negotiation. (Note: usually whenever you signal your BATNA, you should also re-emphasize your interest in reaching an agreement).

Examples:

> I've received another offer from [OTHER CORP] that's very compelling on salary, but I really love the mission of [YOUR COMPANY] and think that it would overall be a better fit for me.
>
> I'm also considering going back to grad school and getting a Master's degree in Postmodern Haberdashery. I'm excited about [YOUR COMPANY] though and would love to join the team, but the package has to make sense if I'm going to forego a life of ironic hatmaking.

Note: one of the biggest mistakes I see here is from people who are currently working. If you already have a job, staying where you are is often your BATNA.

This means if you tell your interlocutor that you hate your job, then they know your BATNA sucks, and have no incentive to negotiate with you (on top of potentially thinking that you're a negative person). Always emphasize the pros of your current company, your seniority, your impact, and whatever else you like about where you currently work.

*You should make your decision seem genuinely close for it to be a strong BATNA.*

## What a Job Negotiation Means to an Employer

I've kept saying that to be an effective negotiator you need to understand the other side. So let's take a look at what it's like to negotiate as an employer. (I'm going to have to use the tech industry in my examples here; the details will differ by industry.)

First, we have to rewind and understand what brought us to this offer in the first place. What kind of resources have they spent so far in trying to fill this position?

* Writing and posting a job description on all appropriate channels ($300)
* Reviewing ~100 or more resumes ($1250)
* About 15% of those resumes need to be phone screened, so roughly 15 phone screens ($2250)
* Around 75% of those initial phone screens warrant a technical screen, so roughly 11 technical screens ($9000)
* About 30% pass through to an on-site, so roughly 3 onsites. These onsites require the coordination of 6-7 employees ($10800)
* Finally, they make one offer. The recruiter (and potentially the executive staff) need to spend time on the phone with the offeree convincing and negotiating. ($900)

<p class="note">Numbers nabbed from <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-average-cost-of-recruiting-an-engineer-in-Silicon-Valley/answer/Rick-Brownlow?srid=tvlO">here</a>.</p>

All-in-all this process took about 45 days from start to finish.

Now say you end up turning down their offer. They've spent over $24,000 just extending this single offer to you (to say nothing of opportunity costs), and now they'll essentially have to start over from scratch.

This is what a company faces if you turn them down.

Realize what a gauntlet they've been through!

Realize how important it is that you're the one!

Out of the droves and droves who've shown up on their doorstep, *you're* the one they want. They want to usher you into their tribe. They went through so much crap to get you here, and now they've found you.

And you're worried that if you negotiate, they'll take it away?

Further yet, understand that salary is only one part of the cost of employing you. An employer also has to pay for your benefits, your equipment, space, utilities, other random expenses, and employment taxes on top of all of that. All-in, [your actual salary often comprises less than 50% of the total cost of employing you](http://web.mit.edu/e-club/hadzima/pdf/how-much-does-an-employee-cost.pdf).

(Which means they expect that your value to the company, in terms of the revenue you'll generate, to be more than 2x your salary. If they didn't believe that, they wouldn't be hiring you at all.)

So, this is all to say: everything is stacked in your favor. It doesn't feel that way, but it absolutely is.

Realize that when you are agonizing over whether to ask for another few thousand dollars, what they're doing is praying with bated breath that you'll sign the offer.

If you don't sign the offer, they lose. Losing a good candidate sucks. No one wants to believe that their company isn't worth working for.

They want to win. They will pay to win.

And yet, you might worry: &ldquo;but if end up negotiating more, won't they have higher expectations? Won't my boss end up hating me for negotiating?&rdquo;

**No, and no.**

It's your role that will determine your performance expectations, not how much you negotiated. Making 5k more or less in salary doesn't matter at all. Your manager will literally just not care about this.

Remember how expensive it is to even employ you in the first place! Nobody's going to fire you because you're performing 5K worse than they expected you to; the cost of firing you and hiring someone else is a lot more than 5K to begin with.

And no, your boss won't hate you now. And in fact, at most big companies the person you're negotiating with won't even be your boss. Recruiting and management are totally separate departments, completely abstracted from one another. And even if you're at a startup, trust me that your boss is used to negotiating with candidates and doesn't put nearly as much significance in it as you do.

In short: negotiating is easier and more normal than you think, and companies are completely willing to negotiate with you. If your intuition tells you otherwise, trust that your mental model is wrong.

## How to Give the First Number

In [part 1](https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/), I mentioned how valuable it is not to have to give the first number. But there are times when you can't avoid it. In that case, there are ways to give the first number without giving the first number.

If a company asks you &ldquo;what are your salary expectations?&rdquo; you might say:

> I don't have any particular numbers in mind. I'm more interested in learning whether this will be a good mutual fit. If it is, I'm open to exploring any offer so long as it's competitive.

Sounds good. But they push back,

> I understand that, but we need to have a clear idea of what you think is competitive. I need to know whether it's worth going through the interview process. We're a young startup, so I need to make sure we're on the same page as far as compensation.

That's a strong push. But you can still push back.

> I completely hear you, and I agree it's important that we're on the same page. I really have no particular numbers in my head, it all depends on the fit and the composition of the offer. Once we decide we want to work together, I think that's the best time to figure out a compensation package that makes sense.

Most employers will relent here. But there's a small chance they push further:

> Okay, look, you're being difficult. Let's not waste each other's time. What's an offer that you'd be willing to take?

This is a decision point. They're trying to take away your negotiating power and pin you to a premature decision.

That said, you probably will have to say a number at this point, or risk damaging the trust in this relationship. (They *are* making a valid point that startups can't offer the same kind of cash as large companies, nor should you expect them to. They might be sensing that you're not aware of this.)

But you can give a number here without actually giving a number.

> Well, okay. I know that the average software engineer in Silicon Valley makes roughly 120K a year salary. So I think that's a good place to start.

Notice what I did here. I didn't actually answer the question &ldquo;what's an offer you'd be willing to take,&rdquo; I merely anchored the conversation around the fulcrum of &ldquo;the average software engineer salary.&rdquo;

So if you're forced to give a number, do so by appealing to an objective metric, such as an industry average (or your current salary). And make it clear that you're merely starting the negotiation there, not ending it.

## How to Ask for More

Say an offer is out there, and now you want to improve it. As always, be direct and ask for what you want. Here are generally the steps you should take.

First, reiterate your interest in the company. This is as simple as:

> I'm really excited about the problems you guys are working on at Evil Corp&hellip;

Now frame why you're asking for more. There are two choices here: you can say that you're on the fence and that an improvement might convince you, or you can go stronger and say that you're outright dissatisfied with the offer. Which approach you choose depends on how much leverage you have, how weak the offer is relative to your BATNA, and whether you have other offers (the weaker your negotiating position, generally the more tentative you should be).

Either way, be unfailingly polite.

If you're dissatisfied with the offer, you might say something like:

> I appreciate the work you guys put into constructing this offer. But there were a couple things I was unsatisfied with.

If you want to be more reserved, you can say something like:

> The offer you guys extended was strong. Right now my decision is basically between you and [XYZ CORP]. It's a genuinely difficult decision for me, but there are a couple of dimensions where, if this offer improved, it would be much more compelling.

Don't just say something like:

> Thanks for the offer. Here are some ways I think it could improve.

This makes you sound like an ass. Be polite, and if you want to strengthen the offer, tell them clearly how you feel about it. This builds trust and conveys seriousness.

Let's say you want to raise the salary. Now that you have a specific ask, it's time to employ **rule #7: proclaim reasons for everything.**

We all implicitly know the catch-22 of negotiation: if you say you want more salary, you'll sound greedy. And no one likes greedy people, right? So why would they want to give more money to a greedy person?

I suspect this is the primary reason why so many candidates recoil from negotiating. They don't want to *feel* greedy. It goes against all of their social conditioning. And yet, there are some situations in which most people would be totally fine negotiating.

Specifically, *when they have to.*

If you *had* to raise your salary or you wouldn't be able to afford rent, or if you had to negotiate health insurance to cover a medical condition, you'd negotiate without a twinge of regret. The difference? That you have a *reason* for what you're requesting.

It's kind of a brain-hack, both for yourself and for your negotiating partner. Just stating a reason&mdash;any reason&mdash;makes your request feel human and important. It's not you being greedy, it's you trying to fulfill your goals.

The more unobjectionable and sympathetic your reason, the better. If it's medical expenses, or paying off student loans, or taking care of family, you'll bring tears to their eyes. I told employers that I was earning-to-give, so since I was donating 33% of my income to charity, I had negotiate aggressively to leave myself enough to live off.

But honestly, even if your reason is inane and unimpressive, it will still carry this effect.

Just saying &ldquo;can you improve the salary?&rdquo; sounds like you're boringly motivated by money. But if you say &ldquo;I really want to buy a house within the next year; what can we do to improve the salary?&rdquo; this suddenly seems a lot more legitimate.

If they turn down your request now, they're implicitly telling you &ldquo;no Jennifer, you can't buy your house. I guess you don't deserve one.&rdquo; No one wants to do that. They want to be the one who says &ldquo;Alright Jennifer, I talked with the director and I made it happen. You're getting that new house!&rdquo;

Of course, it goes without saying that the reason you want money is so that you can spend it on things. What do they think you're going to use it for, toilet paper?

I know. It's stupid. It's really stupid, but it works.

Just go with it, state a reason for everything, and you'll find recruiters more willing to become your advocate.

## Assert your Value

One effective move you can make in a negotiation, especially after an ask, is to emphasize the unique value you'll be bringing to the company. Example:

> Blah blah blah, I want X, Y, and Z.
>
> I know that you guys are looking for someone to build out your Android team. I believe I bring a lot of experience leading a team of Android developers and I'm confident that I'll be able to bring your mobile offerings up to parity with your competitors.
>
> Let me know your thoughts.

Be confident without boasting or trying to hold yourself specific metrics (unless you're supremely confident). Whatever you assert should be something you've touched on earlier in your discussions, but it's okay to repeat it now as a gentle reminder. It reminds them of the carrot and shows that you're still excited to add value.

This is not appropriate in every negotiation, especially for very junior positions, where it's harder to differentiate yourself. But later in your career (or for more specialized/consulting roles) this can be a really valuable nudge.

## What to Ask For

This brings me to **rule #8: be motivated by more than just money.** Note, this is not code for &ldquo;if you seem like you're motivated by more than just money, you'll get more money.&rdquo;

There is no bigger turn-off to a company than somebody who only cares about money. This is something you're not going to be able to fake.

*Actually be motivated by other things.* You should be motivated by money too of course, but it should be one among many dimensions you're optimizing for. How much training you get, what your first project will be, which team you join, or even who your mentor will be&mdash;these are all things you can and should negotiate.

Among these factors, salary is perhaps the least important.

What do you really value? Be creative. Don't try to haggle over slices of cake when there's so much more on the table.

Of course, to negotiate well you need to understand the other side's preferences. You want to make the deal better for *both of you.* That's why **rule #9 is: understand what the company values.**

How do you figure this out? Well, there are a few good rules of thumb.

First, salary is almost always the hardest thing to give, for a few reasons.

1. It must be paid year after year, so it becomes part of a company's long-term burn rate.
2. It is almost always the thing that people gossip about, so paying someone significantly more salary can cause unrest.
3. It tends to be the most tightly constrained by pay bands, especially at large companies.

So if you want more financial compensation, you should think about structuring as much of it as possible outside of salary. A signing bonus, for example, is easier to give than salary. A signing bonus has the advantage of only needing to be paid once, it gets the candidate excited about joining (because everyone likes wads of cash), and it's generally not as public.

Remember that you can always get salary raises as you continue to work at the company, but there's only one point at which you can get a signing bonus.

The easiest thing for a company to give though is stock (if the company offers stock). Companies like giving stock because it invests you in the company and aligns interests. It also shifts some of the risk from the company over to you and burns less cash.

If you are genuinely risk-neutral or early in your career, then you should generally try to assume as much stock as possible. If you aggressively trade cash for stock, you can end up with a higher expected value offer (albeit with higher risk).

## A Brief Primer on Equity

You can skip this section if you're already pretty familiar with how equity works. I'm going to speaking to the totally uninitiated here, because too many people get swindled when it comes to valuing stock.

First, understand there are two completely different classes of companies: public companies and private companies. If the company is public (i.e., it has IPOed and is listed on the stock market), then its stock is as good as cash. You will usually be granted RSUs (Restricted Stock Units), which are just shares like you can purchase on the stock market. Once these shares vest (that is, are released to you), you can turn around and sell them on the stock market. This is how they turn into money.

If the company is private, then things get a lot more complicated. For private companies, most of the time they will not actually issue you stock grants. Usually, they will issue you stock options. An option is a pre-agreed right to purchase shares of stock at a frozen price.

It's important to note that when you want to leave a company, if you have options, your life becomes really complicated. You may have to pay a bunch of money to actually exercise your option (that is, buy your pre-agreed upon stock at the previous frozen price, or risk losing it), with no way to actually sell it yet. The only way to truly liquidate your options is when the company IPOs or is acquired. And many companies don't ever do either.

Thus, options are very risky. It's easier to get screwed by options, especially on tax implications. For a lot more information, see [this post](http://a16z.com/2016/08/24/options-ownership/) by Scott Kupor of a16z.

## Equity Shenanigans

Many companies will try to play mindgames with you when it comes to equity. Several companies pulled these on me.

A common one is presenting the total value of the stock grant rather than the annualized value, despite the the stock not vesting evenly, or vesting over 5 years instead of the standard 4.

But the most egregious thing that companies will do is tell you absurd stories about the value of their stock. They'll say: &ldquo;okay, we're worth this much now, but at the rate we're growing we're going to be worth 10X that in a year. So really, the value of your options is many millions of dollars!&rdquo;

To not mince words: this is cynically dishonest bullshit. Don't buy it even for a second. I got this a few times, and the only reason I didn't walk away from the offer immediately was because it was always a recruiter pulling this crap. If it was a manager I would've turned down the offer outright.

Here's why this is infuriatingly stuptags: [a company's valuation is determined by investors. These investors see the financials and the growth rate of the company, and invest at a price that **reflects the current growth rate of the company.** In other words, they invested at a valuation that already took their 10x growth rate into account. Investors are not idiots. And unless you (or your recruiter) think you have privileged information or insight that the company's investors don't, you should probably take the investors' word for it.

(Not to mention a company's nominal valuation is almost always inflated due to preferred shares, debt, and survivorship bias, but let's ignore that for now.)

So if a company gives you this hock of crap, fire back and tell them thank you, but you'll be considering the stock at the same valuation their investors valued it at.

I mean, be nice. But don't let them try to strong-arm you into accepting this garbage.

A job is not a suicide pact. Choose a company that is judicious and transparent, and you'll be much more likely to find yourself respected and taken care of.

## Other Things You Can Ask For

Because I'd be remiss if I didn't point out a few other things.

Relocation expenses often come out of separate budgets at big companies, so this is generally very easy to get.

Look for creative benefits that would be particularly valuable to you. Maybe it's covering your commuter expenses, asking for dedicated volunteer or learning time, getting sponsored for conferences, or even charity donation matching.

Don't assume anything's off the table until you've tried bringing it up.

That said, don't throw the entire kitchen sink at them. A negotiation can quickly become cumbersome for an employer if you bring up a litany of changes. Keep the changeset as pithy as you can.

## Negotiating Jiu Jitsu

Recruiters love trying to trick you into ending the negotiation early. They're going to do this relentlessly. Don't fault them for it&mdash;I suspect they can't help themselves.

Just keep breaking out of their shenanigans, and don't let yourself be pressured into ending a negotiation until you're actually ready to make a final decision. This is especially grave if you have multiple offers, and you let one company pressure you into canceling the others. Companies succeed in doing this all the time, so I want to equip you with the skills to jiu jitsu out of these techniques.

Here are two situations you can break out of. (These are both real situations that happened to me during my negotiations, though the numbers and details are invented.)

### Situation 1:

I ask for a 10K increase in signing bonus. The company gets back to me and says,

> That's really tough for us to do. I'm going to try, I think you're worth it, but I can't really go to my boss and fight for you unless she knows you're going to sign. Are you going to sign if I get you that 10K?

You should be thinking: ah, this person is trying to force me to a decision point and take away my negotiating power.

I respond:

> Okay, so what I'm hearing is that you'll have to expend some personal reputation to get me a 10K bonus. If you end up going to bat for me, are you confident you'll be able to get that 10K?

They respond:

>I think I can, it just comes down to you Haseeb. If you're serious about joining us, then I'll go fight for you. But I need to know for sure you'll sign.

Great. Time to Jiu Jitsu.

> That makes sense. Unfortunately I can't commit to signing yet; I'm not yet at the stage where I can make a final decision. Like I told you before, this weekend I'm going to sit down with my family and talk things over with them. Choosing the company I'm going to spend the next few years at is a commitment I take really seriously, and so I want to be sure I'm making a well-considered decision.

> But since you're confident that you can get an extra 10K, let's do this instead: in my mind, I'll pretend this offer is [X + 10K] and as I'm considering my final decision, that's where I'll value it. I know it's tough for you to go and get that from your boss, so I don't want you to do that until I'm certain I'm going to sign.

They then vaguely recant and promptly get approval for the 10K bonus.

### Situation 2:

I ask for a 20% increase in stock package. The hiring manager, knowing that I'm negotiating with other companies, then fires back:

> I want to get this stock package for you. And I know I can, we've got the budget. But before I do that, I need your word on something.

> What's that?

> I need you to give me your word that if I improve your offer, you're not going to just turn around and take our counter-offer to [COMPETITOR_COMPANY] to improve your offer with them.

You should be thinking: so basically they're asking me not to negotiate. Cute.

> Let me see if I understand what you're saying. You are willing to improve my offer, but only if I agree that I won't tell [COMPETITOR] what you're offering me. Is that correct?

> Well no, I can't legally do that. What I mean is&hellip;what I mean is, look. I like you. But if I improve your offer and you just take our offer to [COMPETITOR], you'll be violating my trust.

> Okay, let me be sure I understand you here. If you give me this offer and I tell [COMPETITOR], I will be violating the trust under which you're granting me this improved offer. Is that correct?

> Uhh&hellip;Look. How about this. In my mind, I'm going to go get you this stock package okay? And in my head, I'm going to do it with the assumption that you're the kind of person I think you are, and you're going to consider our offer in its own right and not just shop it around. Fair enough?

I nod. He gets the improved offer. I continue to negotiate. Antics averted.

(In case you're wondering, if he had said &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; I would have turned down the proposal.)

## The Path to Signing

It's not enough to just continually ask for stuff. Companies need to sense that you're actually moving toward a final decision, and not just playing games with them.

Your goal in a negotiation is not to be difficult or elusive. True, you should assert your value and carefully consider your options, but you can do so in a way that's respectful and considerate toward the companies you're talking to.

Don't go dark on people. Be open and communicative. I keep saying be honest and I mean it&mdash;be honest.

Aside: I keep talking about honesty, and you might protest that this is antithetical to my earlier rule of &ldquo;protect information.&rdquo; It's not. True, you should protect information that might weaken your negotiating position, but you should be as communicative as possible about everything else (which is most things).

Negotiating is all about relationship, and communication is the bedrock of any relationship.

This brings me to the **the final rule: be winnable.** This is more than just giving the company the impression that you like them (which you continually should). But more so that you must give any company you're talking to a clear path on how to win you. Don't bullshit them or play stupid games. Be clear and unequivocal with your preferences and timeline.

If there is nothing that a company could do to sign you, or you don't actually want to work for them, then don't negotiate with them. Period.

Don't waste their time or play games for your own purposes. Even if the company isn't your dream company, you must be able to imagine at least some package they could offer you that would make you sign. If not, politely turn them down.

It costs each company money to interview you and to negotiate with you. I didn't negotiate with every company I received an offer from, but if there was one key mistake I made in my job search, it was that I still negotiated with too many (in large part because I didn't think my job search would be successful).

## Making the Final Decision

Okay, it's decision time.

(Yes, you do have to make one.)

Three things to keep in mind here:

1. Be clear about your deadline.
2. Assert your deadline continually.
3. Use your final decision as your trump card.

When you start negotiating you don't have to be clear about your timeline because you probably don't have one yet. But once you get into intermediary stages, you should set for yourself a deadline on which you'll sign. It can be for an arbitrary reason (or no reason at all), but just pre-committing to a deadline will allow you to negotiate more clearly and powerfully.

&ldquo;A weekend with the family.&rdquo; I found works nicely, as it has the added benefit of roping other decision makers in. Then when companies push you to end negotiations early, you can re-assert this deadline.

Companies should all be totally aware of when you're going to make your decision. This will raise the stakes and galvanize negotiations as the deadline approaches.

This deadline also lets you defer your decision while still improving offers. Your narrative should basically be &ldquo;I want to see the strongest offer your company can muster. Then I will go into my cave, meditate for 10 days, and when I emerge I will have decided in my heart which company to join.&rdquo; This gives you enormous power to avoid any on-the-spot decision points or premature promises.

Eventually, deadline day will come. Try to make this a business day (say, a Friday or a Monday) so that you can communicate with recruiters during this day. If a hail mary is going to happen, it'll happen here.

Even if there's only one company in the running, you should always *always* wait until the last day to sign your offer. Yes, even if you're certain you're going to sign and even if it's your dream job. I've seen many scenarios in which offers spontaneously improved as deadlines approached, or a fallen player gets up and presents you the holy grail in the 11th hour. Either way, there's no harm.

Finally, your trump card. Save this for the very end. Your trump card is these words: &ldquo;If you can do X, I will sign.&rdquo; Note, this is NOT &ldquo;If you give me X, the offer will be more compelling blah blah blah.&rdquo; Fuck that. It's time to make a promise.

Every company that's still on the table, let them know what it would take to sign you (unless there's nothing they could do). And when you make the final ask, don't forget reason-giving, even if it's the same reason as before!

> Hi Joel, I've been thinking it over and it's genuinely a really tough decision for me. I loved everyone at [COMPANY] but the one thing that makes it hard for me is the salary. As you know I'm trying to pay off my student loans so salary is really important to me right now. If you can improve the salary by 10K a year, then I'll be totally ready to sign.

With luck, they meet you half-way. Or, with a little more luck, they'll meet you all the way.

And just because I know someone will ask&mdash;yes, once say you're going to sign, you should always sign. Never go back on your word. It's a small world, people talk, and these kind of things will come back to haunt you. (More importantly, never go back on your word because you're the kind of person who never goes back on their word.)

Tell all of the other parties that you've made your final decision. Thank them for the negotiation. If you did it well, they'll usually thank you back, tell you to keep in touch, and to reach out again in a couple years next time you're on the market.

And that's it. You did it! Congratulations! You're still alive, right?

&hellip;You're not moving.

Well, that's fine. It's time to celebrate your new job, you beautiful fool! (Drinks are on you.)

If you got some value out of this article, share it with a friend who'd benefit from it. Or better yet, [follow me on Twitter and I can be your friend](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?original_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fhaseebq.com%2F%3Fp%3D2393%26preview%3Dtrue&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&region=follow_link&screen_name=hosseeb&tw_p=followbutton).

There's a lot more in the works.

Until next time,]

title: 10 Principles I Want to Live By

---

I just came home from a vow of silence at a meditation center in northern California. It's a strange feeling coming back to city life after five days of silent meditation.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*W3bSf7ni68rbzw8Wy_tJTg.jpeg)

Looking around at puffing joggers, Christmas wreaths, eager couples waiting outside restaurants, the stop and start of traffic&mdash;it's almost too much for my senses.

The last time I took a vow of silence was 5 years ago. It lasted ten days. I had just walked away from my career as a poker player then. I was lost, confused. I was angry at myself. Entering the veil of silence, I expected to come out the other side with answers.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LXZVHL32G3g">[video]</div>

It was probably the hardest ten days of my life. But when I got to the other side, I emerged with only more questions.

This time feels different. Despite the dark of the winter solstice, I return from my vow of silence with unexpected clarity.

I decided that after I got home, I would write a letter to myself. This is that letter.

These last two years have been a cyclone of change. I've [pledged myself to earning-to-give](https://haseebq.com/why-ive-decided-to-devote-my-career-to-earning-to-give/), I've picked up my life and migrated to San Francisco, I've [shouldered my way into the tech industry](https://haseebq.com/farewell-app-academy-hello-airbnb-part-i/). Now I am a full-time software engineer.

I've been moving so fast, so much has obviously shifted. Yet internally, I still have this old image of myself. I've forgotten to even ask myself&mdash;what do I value now? How has it changed?

I wanted to create a document that I can look back on, to remind myself of my principles. If times are ever tough or I'm feeling stranded, that this letter can be a lodestone to guide me.

Call it a personal manifesto.

Usually when I write blog posts, I write them for other people. This post will be an exception&mdash;I am writing this first and foremost for myself. Nevertheless, I hope that this posts inspires your reflection, and that you might consider how these principles might be useful to you too.

## 1. Live simply.

You already have everything you need.

Simplify. Give things away. Turn down offers for more. Know that you are complete and you don't need more things to live a good life.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*SxUjpFIsHW7t7Iv2k3Nqqw.jpeg)

What a pleasure it is to pack up your life into a few bags and embark on a new life! Allow yourself to do that, again, and again, and again.

Of course, there's no shame in having things. But whatever you have, consider it all borrowed&mdash;and when it must be returned, do it with joy.

## 2. You will always have haters. Ignore them.

If you are passionate, if you are strange, if you defy what most people assume are the rules, you will court haters.

That's fine. Let them hate if that's what they need. Their hate will make you more resilient.

But most of all, you should be thankful that they showed up. Because if they didn't, it would be a sure sign what you were doing was not important.

> You have enemies? Good. That means you've stood up for something, sometime in your life. <div class="source">Winston Churchill</div>

## 3. Fight quietly for the things that matter.

Whether it be the people you love, or the causes that matter to you&mdash;do good work. Be humble. Fight hard, and fight with everything you've got.

Attention or fame can be pleasurable, sometimes even useful. But more often than not, it's a distraction from the real work.

## 4. Give yourself up.

It's not about you. It's about something bigger than you.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2ZlJC9xDCKWjUDj8ufheqA.jpeg)

Give. Contribute. Not just money, or time, but your identity. Make your life about more than just you.

> Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life? <div class="source">Mary Oliver, &ldquo;The Summer Day&rdquo;</div>

## 5. Seek mastery.

Get better.

Work harder.

Practice, study, fumble.

Do this all your life.

Call it passion.

## 6. Be forever a student.

There will always be people who are better, stronger, wiser than you.

When you don't know something, proclaim it out loud. Feverishly seek the answers. Wear out your knees with humbleness. Never let ignorance or shame deter you, because the desire to learn is always noble.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qBuMPCuhUBhdTr2HAmv34g.jpeg)

Go searching for your teachers, and don't give up until you find them.

## 7. Cultivate virtue&mdash;by force, if you have to.

You are a coward. You are fearful, you are lazy, you are selfish. Only once you know this can you begin the work of cultivating virtue.

You are principally what you do. So pledge. Show up. Keep coming back. And when you are too afraid to stay, sometimes you must lock yourself in the room and throw away the key.

## 8. You will find your own way.

Your life, your path, your failures and successes will not look like other people's. Though you will read many books and hear many stories, for better or for worse, their blueprints will not apply to you.

That's fine. You'll do great things, and in your own way. You will forge a path that no one will expect&mdash;not even you.

That's okay. Trust that your path, strange though it will seem, is right for you.

## 9. Build your wings on the way down.

Be smart, be calculated, be careful. But when opportunity arises, steel your nerves and take the leap. If you don't see any risks worth taking, you're not paying attention.

It's okay if you don't know what you're doing&mdash;trust that you'll learn before you hit the floor. And if you crash: brush yourself off, forgive your errors, and try again. This is the only way progress has ever happened.

## 10. Stay hungry, stay foolish.

You are a little bit crazy. The world needs people like you&mdash;reckless, steaming, hapless dreamers.

So don't give it up. Keep asking for too much. Hunger for the world and everything in it, and don't slow down, no matter what people say.

I'll be writing more soon about my donations and some reflections on 2016. But for now, thanks for reading.

I was originally planning to write this post reflecting on 2016 and my year-end donations (I know, better late than never). But given the political climate in the U.S. right now, I'm feeling pretty shaken. I don't usually write about politics, but I decided I needed to share a few thoughts.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c9stBEAGF4I">[video]</div>

First, donations.

[Note: for those who don't know my background; I am an effective altruist, and I earn-to-give. This means I entered into the tech industry so I could donate 33% of my pre-tax income to high-impact charities every year. I also blog openly about it.]

I first started earning-to-give when I landed my first job in the tech industry in June 2015. [In 2015 I donated a total of **$21,200**](https://haseebq.com/my-first-year-earning-to-give-a-retrospective/).

In 2016, my donations totaled **$50,600**. My finances this year were little more complicated, but that was my best estimate of 33% of my pre-tax income. (That income does not include RSUs; whenever I can liquidate them, I will also donate 33% of their value.)

Below are the organizations I donated to and why.

## The Against Malaria Foundation

*Donation: $12,650 (25%)*

[The Against Malaria Foundation](https://www.againstmalaria.com/) distributes low-cost anti-mosquito bednets in parts of Africa that are ravaged by malaria. AMF has been repeatedly ranked by Givewell as the dollar-for-dollar most impactful charity in the world.

It's important to make speculative and high-risk altruistic investments. But there is some straightforward value in just rewarding and spreading the word about organizations that rock at saving lives (and in the worst case, to have no doubt that one's donations are having real positive impact). I also donated to them in 2015, and good chance I'll donate again in 2017.

## .impact

*Donation: $12,650 (25%)*

[.impact](http://dotimpact.im/) is a grassroots EA organization that maintains a lot of Effective Altruism's infrastructure, including the [EA Forum](http://effective-altruism.com/) (which I highly recommend). One of their most exciting projects is LEAN (Local Effective Altruism Network), which helps to seed and support university EA organizations. I also donated to them in 2015.

Young people have already shown that in many ways they are going to be the primary vector for change in this world. And as those young people come into power, I'd love to see more of them thinking rigorously about how to do good. 

In short, I think influencing more young people to think critically about effectiveness is one of our best levers for ensuring a positive future.

## 80,000 Hours

*Donation: $25,300 (50%)*

My largest donation this year was to [80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/) (80K). 80K is an organization that advises young people on how to do the most good with their careers. They analyze different career paths, balancing career capital with altruistic aims.

80K actually strongly affected my own trajectory when I was considering career pursuits. Reading through their career guide on tech entrepreneurship influenced my original decision to enter into the tech industry.

[80K has had had impressive growth and has done a lot of good for influencing more students on the path to altruistic lives](https://80000hours.org/2016/12/annual-review-dec-2016/). There's a big talent gap in effective altruism right now, and 80K seems like the best investment for filling that gap. I'm excited to see what they can do in 2017.

So that wraps up my donations. Now I'd like to do what I normally never do, and say a few words about the political climate in the U.S.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LeEPFvCBl6u638r_dsvViA.png)

## Authoritarianism, walls, and the &ldquo;Muslim Ban&rdquo;

Far more capable minds than mine have spilled enough ink on this topic, so I'm going to keep my words brief.

Things are moving faster than anyone expected. But history has seen this before. **Our environment is likely to change fast, and unpredictably.**

Keep your eyes open. Be vigilant. Know your power and use it wisely, and where you have none, stay safe.

It's a scary and saddening time. History books will struggle to make sense of this. And when we are old, we will look back and talk with shame about the barbarism that America, for a time, succumbed to.

But I am optimistic. When I see the protests happening across the U.S. and around the world, the international condemnation of these regressive and protectionist policies, when I see the power and fury of a culture founded on inclusion and love&mdash;it gives me confidence.

The world is changing. Though we may have stumbled, we are going to take two steps forward.

I, for one, am going to keep fighting in my own way. 

I hope you do the same.

title: The Time I Had to Crack My Own Reddit Password
tags: [personal, programming]

---

**I have no self-control.**

Luckily, I know this about myself. This allows me to consciously engineer my life so that despite having the emotional maturity of a heroin-addicted lab rat, I'm occasionally able to get things done.

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/gOH54eiriYIwM/giphy.gif">
<div class="caption">Mm, a waste of time!</div>

I waste a lot of time on Reddit. If I want to procrastinate on something, I'll often open a new tab and dive down a Reddit-hole. But sometimes one needs to turn on the blinders and dial down distractions. 2015 was one of these times&mdash;I was singularly focused on improving as a programmer, and Redditing was becoming a liability.

I needed an abstinence plan.

So it occurred to me: how about I lock myself out of my account? 

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zI-riJZiY7s">[video]</div>

## Here's what I did:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*8Zpw3ipnu92ehqA_6T-o8w.gif)

I set a random password on my account. Then I asked a friend to e-mail me this password on a certain date. With that, I'd have a foolproof way to lock myself out of Reddit. (Also changed the e-mail for password recovery to cover all the bases.)

This should have worked.

Unfortunately it turns out, friends are very susceptible to social engineering. The technical terminology for this is that they are &ldquo;nice to you&rdquo; and will give you back your password if you &ldquo;beg them.&rdquo;

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/uB6rsQFg5yPzW/giphy.gif)

After a few rounds of this failure mode, I needed a more robust solution. A little Google searching, and I came across this:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*iMtDCzvNYVF9UOeiIbU7Ww.png)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*7QCLp-4HnnDwgj1FSnRstw.png)
<div class="caption">(Looks legit.)</div>

Perfect&mdash;an automated, friend-less solution! (I'd alienated most of them by now, so that was a big selling point.)

A bit sketchy looking, but hey, any port in a storm.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TOUIDOIRHiVySUWt46n3mw.gif)

For a while I set this up this routine&mdash;during the week I'd e-mail myself my password, on the weekends I'd receive the password, load up on internet junk food, and then lock myself out again once the week began. It worked quite well from what I remember.

Eventually I got so busy with programming stuff, I completely forgot about it.

## Cut to two years later.

I'm now gainfully employed at Airbnb. And Airbnb, it so happens, has a large test suite. This means waiting, and waiting of course means internet rabbit holes.

I decide to scrounge up my old account and find my Reddit password.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sAr_MYJtJVkNq6uHiVQxtQ.gif)

Oh. *Oh. Oh shit.*

I didn't remember doing this, but I must have gotten so fed up with myself that **I locked myself out until 2018**. I also set it to &ldquo;hide,&rdquo; so I couldn't view the contents of the e-mail until it's sent.

What do I do? Do I just have to create a new Reddit account and start from scratch? But that's *so much work.*

I could write in to LetterMeLater and explain that I didn't mean to do this. But they would probably take a while to get back to me. We've already established I'm wildly impatient. Plus this site doesn't look like it has a support team. Not to mention it would be an embarrassing e-mail exchange. I started brainstorming elaborate explanations involving dead relatives about why I needed access to the e-mail…

All of my options were messy. I was walking home that night from the office pondering my predicament, when suddenly it hit me.

**The search bar.**

I pulled up the app on my mobile phone and tried it:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DvLUtm_ZGOaTGKy1bOuyYQ.gif)

Hmm.

Okay. So it's indexing the subject for sure. What about the body?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*esw6gkV0G-M1JKaPAqipLA.gif)

I try a few letters, and voila. It's definitely got the body indexed. Remember: the body consisted entirely of my password.

*Essentially, I've been given an interface to perform substring queries.* By entering in a string into the search bar, the search results will confirm whether my password contains this substring.

**We're in business.**

I hurry into my apartment, drop my bag, and pull out my laptop.

Algorithms problem: you are given a function `substring?(str)`, which returns true or false depending on whether a password contains any given substring. *Given this function, write an algorithm that can deduce the hidden password.*

## The Algorithm

So let's think about this. A few things I know about my password: I know it was a long string with some random characters, probably something along the lines of `asgoihej2409g`. I *probably* didn't include any upper-case characters (and Reddit doesn't enforce that as a password constraint) so let's assume for now that I didn't&mdash;in case I did, we can just expand the search space later if the initial algorithm fails.

We also have a subject line as part of the string we're querying. And we know the subject is &ldquo;password&rdquo;.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XvaVCyWtSdqKSz59HKnNDw.png)

Let's pretend the body is 6 characters long. So we've got six slots of characters, some of which may appear in the subject line, some of which certainly don't. So if we take all of the characters that aren't in the subject and try searching for each of them, we know for sure we'll hit a unique letter that's in the password. Think like a game of Wheel of Fortune.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LOzh--_Ujutrh_OKhjfNaw.png)

We keep trying letters one by one until we hit a match for something that's not in our subject line. Say we hit it.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fdoVAq3t5naQ5G9yARr0RA.png)

Once I've found my first letter, I don't actually know where in this string I am. But I know I can start building out a bigger substring by appending different characters to the end of this until I hit another substring match.

We'll potentially have to iterate through every character in our alphabet to find it. Any of those characters could be correct, so on average it'll hit somewhere around the middle, so given an alphabet of size `A`, it should average out to `A/2` guesses per letter (let's assume the subject is small and there are no repeating patterns of 2+ characters).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GJ5xKZzTe0F5un-Iz11pXg.png)

I'll keep building this substring until it eventually hits the end and no characters can extend it further.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*E9ri3Rf8LBPxUTjgs5BvPQ.png)

But that's not enough&mdash;most likely, there will be a prefix to the string that I missed, because I started in a random place. Easy enough: all I have to do is now repeat the process, except going backwards.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*F_n0WGRP_8RJdFtR-v0b1g.png)

Once the process terminates, I should be able to reconstruct the password. In total, I'll need to figure out `L` characters (where `L` is the length), and need to expend on average `A/2` guesses per character (where `A` is the alphabet size), so total guesses = `A/2 \* L`.

To be precise, I also have to add another `2A` to the number of guesses for ascertaining that the string has terminated on each end. So the total is `A/2 \* L + 2A`, which we can factor as `A(L/2 + 2)`.

Let's assume we have 20 characters in our password, and an alphabet consisting of `a-z` (26) and `0–9` (10), so a total alphabet size of 36. So we're looking at an average of `36 \* (20/2 + 2) = 36 \* 12 = 432` iterations.

Damn.

This is actually doable.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/119cVU19ICcAKc/giphy.gif)

## The Implementation

First things first: I need to write a client that can programmatically query the search box. This will serve as my substring oracle. Obviously this site has no API, so I'll need to scrape the website directly.

Looks like the URL format for searching is just a simple query string, `www.lettermelater.com/account.php?**qe=#{query_here}**`. That's easy enough.

Let's start writing this script. I'm going to use the Faraday gem for making web requests, since it has a simple interface that I know well.

I'll start by making an API class.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/b34b7e50009ca20511abaf9e4c7e2aab.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/b34b7e50009ca20511abaf9e4c7e2aab).</noscript>

Of course, we don't expect this to work yet, as our script won't be authenticated into any account. As we can see, the response returns a 302 redirect with an error message provided in the cookie.

```
[10] pry(main)> Api.get("foo")
=> #<:response:0x007fc01a5716d8>
...
{"date"=>"Tue, 04 Apr 2017 15:35:07 GMT",
"server"=>"Apache",
"x-powered-by"=>"PHP/5.2.17",
"set-cookie"=>"msg_error=You+must+be+signed+in+to+see+this+page.",
"location"=>".?pg=account.php",
"content-length"=>"0",
"connection"=>"close",
"content-type"=>"text/html; charset=utf-8"},
status=302></:response:0x007fc01a5716d8>
```

So how do we sign in? We need to send in our [cookies](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17769011/how-does-cookie-based-authentication-work) in the header, of course. Using Chrome inspector we can trivially grab them.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*PSxZtW4wppyzRXMdBWgGWw.gif)

(Not going to show my real cookie here, obviously. Interestingly, looks like it's storing `user_id` client-side which is always a great sign.)

Through process of elimination, I realize that it needs both `code` and `user_id` to authenticate me&hellip;sigh.

So I add these to the script. (This is a fake cookie, just for illustration.)

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/8eaaf329895f3dc64a069b7f2c0a0197.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/8eaaf329895f3dc64a069b7f2c0a0197).</noscript>

```
[29] pry(main)> Api.get("foo")
=> "\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN\"\"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd\">\n<html>\n<head>\n\t<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />\n\t<meta name=\"Description\" content=\"LetterMeLater.com allows you to send emails to anyone, with the ability to have them sent at any future date and time you choose.\" />\n\t<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"schedule email, recurring, repeating, delayed, text messaging, delivery, later, future, reminder, date, time, capsule\" />\n\t<title>LetterMeLater.com — Account Information</title>…
[30] pry(main)> _.include?("Haseeb")
=> true
```

It's got my name in there, so we're definitely logged in!

We've got the scraping down, now we just have to parse the result. Luckily, this pretty easy&mdash;we know it's a hit if the e-mail result shows up on the page, so we just need to look for any string that's unique when the result is present. The string &ldquo;password&rdquo; appears nowhere else, so that will do just nicely.=op

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*cZT37Ji9j8sm8dobFpiAWQ.png)

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/4db364c7432730e4f432c3ea3dcac9bc.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/4db364c7432730e4f432c3ea3dcac9bc).</noscript>

That's all we need for our API class. We can now do substring queries entirely in Ruby.

```
[31] pry(main)> Api.include?('password')
=> true
[32] pry(main)> Api.include?('f')
=> false
[33] pry(main)> Api.include?('g')
=> true
```

Now that we know that works, let's stub out the API while we develop our algorithm. Making HTTP requests is going to be really slow and we might trigger some rate-limiting as we're experimenting. If we assume our API is correct, once we get the rest of the algorithm working, everything should just work once we swap the real API back in.

So here's the stubbed API, with a random secret string:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/07630885b15348da15c92835860d5415.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/07630885b15348da15c92835860d5415).</noscript>

We'll inject the stubbed API into the class while we're testing. Then for the final run, we'll use the real API to query for the real password.

So let's get started with this class. From a high level, recalling my algorithm diagram, it goes in three steps:

1. First, find the first letter that's not in the subject but exists in the password. This is our starting off point.
2. Build those letters forward until we fall off the end of the string.
3. Build that substring backwards until we hit the beginning of the string.

Then we're done!

Let's start with initialization. We'll inject the API, and other than that we just need to initialize the current password chunk to be an empty string.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/4cb8aa0c850c6584a584dc76f975dc2f.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/4cb8aa0c850c6584a584dc76f975dc2f).</noscript>

Now let's write three methods, following the steps we outlined.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/ba8b2e06bf9727afe3d10696c786d663.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/ba8b2e06bf9727afe3d10696c786d663).</noscript>

Perfect. Now the rest of the implementation can take place in private methods.

For finding the first letter, we need to iterate over each character in the alphabet that's not contained in the subject. To construct this alphabet, we're going to use `a-z` and `0–9`. Ruby allows us to do this pretty easily with ranges:

```
ALPHABET = (('a'..'z').to_a + ('0'..'9').to_a).shuffle
```

I prefer to shuffle this to remove any bias in the password's letter distribution. This will make our algorithm query `A/2` times on average per character, even if the password is non-randomly distributed.

We also want to set the subject as a constant:

```
SUBJECT = 'password'
```

That's all the setup we need. Now time to write `find_starting_letter`. This needs to iterate through each candidate letter (in the alphabet but not in the subject) until it finds a match.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/32224d08a3c1350dc849521618b0b0ac.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/32224d08a3c1350dc849521618b0b0ac).</noscript>

In testing, looks like this works perfectly:

```
PasswordCracker.new(ApiStub).send(:find_starting_letter!) # => 'f'
```

Now for the heavy lifting.

I'm going to do this recursively, because it makes the structure very elegant.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/3d6ea350690f47790fe8f13b729a00e1.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/3d6ea350690f47790fe8f13b729a00e1).</noscript>

The code is surprisingly straightforward. Let's see if it works with our stub API.

```
[63] pry(main)> PasswordCracker.new(ApiStub).crack!
f
fj
fjp
fjpe
fjpef
fjpefo
fjpefoj
fjpefoj4
fjpefoj49
fjpefoj490
fjpefoj490r
fjpefoj490rj
fjpefoj490rjg
fjpefoj490rjgs
fjpefoj490rjgsd
=> "fjpefoj490rjgsd"
```

Awesome. We've got a suffix, now just to build backward and complete the string. This should look very similar.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/e8fb85d9a9681906e4a0511b1ebfc137.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/e8fb85d9a9681906e4a0511b1ebfc137).</noscript>

In fact, there's only two lines of difference here: how we construct the `guess`, and the name of the recursive call. There's an obvious refactoring here, so let's do it.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/a6f3a62bb3ae96442d6fe13288e3739b.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/a6f3a62bb3ae96442d6fe13288e3739b).</noscript>

Now these other calls simply reduce to:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/192d898aaaff1fed314008f232aaa3cb.js"></script><noscript>View the code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/192d898aaaff1fed314008f232aaa3cb).</noscript>

And let's see how it works in action:

```
Apps-MacBook:password-recovery haseeb$ ruby letter_me_now.rb
Current password: 9
Current password: 90
Current password: 90r
Current password: 90rj
Current password: 90rjg
Current password: 90rjgs
Current password: 90rjgsd
Current password: 90rjgsd
Current password: 490rjgsd
Current password: j490rjgsd
Current password: oj490rjgsd
Current password: foj490rjgsd
Current password: efoj490rjgsd
Current password: pefoj490rjgsd
Current password: jpefoj490rjgsd
Current password: fjpefoj490rjgsd
Current password: pfjpefoj490rjgsd
Current password: hpfjpefoj490rjgsd
Current password: 0hpfjpefoj490rjgsd
Current password: 20hpfjpefoj490rjgsd
Current password: 420hpfjpefoj490rjgsd
Current password: g420hpfjpefoj490rjgsd
g420hpfjpefoj490rjgsd
```

Beautiful. Now let's just add some more print statements and a bit of extra logging, and we'll have our finished `PasswordCracker`.

And now&hellip;the magic moment. Let's swap the stub with the real API and see what happens.

### The Moment of Truth

Cross your fingers&hellip;

```
PasswordCracker.new(Api).crack!
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NR-y9WthtHg4DVjLDwikVA.gif)
<div class="caption">(Sped up 3x)</div>

Boom. 443 iterations.

Tried it out on Reddit, and login was successful.

Wow.

It&hellip;actually worked.

Recall our original formula for the number of iterations: `A(N/2 + 2)`. The true password was 22 characters, so our formula would estimate `36 \* (22/2 + 2) = 36 \* 13 = 468` iterations. Our real password took 443 iterations, so our estimate was within 5% of the observed runtime.

**Math.**

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/26xBI73gWquCBBCDe/giphy.gif)

**It works.**

Embarrassing support e-mail averted. Reddit rabbit-holing restored. It's now confirmed: programming is, indeed, magic.

(The downside is I am now going to have to find a new technique to lock myself out of my accounts.)

And with that, I'm gonna get back to my internet rabbit-holes. Thanks for reading, and share this if you enjoyed it!

---

Imagine you didn't need to trust a stranger to make a deal with them. Imagine you didn't need to trust your bank to deposit your money there. Imagine you didn't need to trust your government to know it was being just and fair.

What would happen?

**It would change the world.**

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k3Zb_4ZOM7M"></div>

This is precisely the promise of blockchains.

Cryptocurrencies, which are built on blockchains, are all over the press these days, mostly because of the high prices, volatility, and sensational narratives surrounding debacles like [Mt. Gox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox) and [The Silk Road](https://www.wired.com/2015/04/silk-road-1/).

But there's something much bigger going on than just digital currencies.

While the mainstream media has been busy speculating about prices and black market intrigues, they've missed the fact that beneath it all, cryptographers had quietly invented an entirely new set of technological primitives.

Blockchains (and the consensus protocols that support them) were invented as a result of cyberpunks trying to solve a bold problem: how to create digital, untraceable money. By combining cryptography, game theory, economics, and computer science, they managed to create an entirely new set of tools for building decentralized systems.

But what they created will change much more than just how we exchange money. It's going to change the entire world. And hardly anyone seems to notice.

Edward Witten, the famous physicist, once said of string theory that it was <q>a part of 21st century physics that fell by chance into the 20th century.</q> In other words, the physics community was not ready for string theory.

**Blockchain is a 22nd century technology that fell by chance into the early 21st century.**

It's painfully obvious that we're not ready for it.

## What is a blockchain?

At its core, a blockchain is a surprisingly simple and elegant data structure. It's basically just a linked list with one important augmentation—each block contains a [cryptographic hash](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) of the previous block. This creates an effectively unalterable chain of blocks and their fingerprints, stretching back to the original block.

![Blockchain](http://i.imgur.com/Ymhi8jq.png)

If everyone in your system replicates this linked list (and verifies its legitimacy by repeating the cryptographic hash functions), it will implement a slow and somewhat crude distributed database that's resistant to tampering.

And that's a blockchain. Doesn't sound that amazing, does it?

Of course, to actually build a functional protocol, you need a lot more than that—you'll need authentication (public/private key cryptography), a consensus mechanism (Nakamoto consensus via proof-of-work or various kinds of proof-of-stake), space and time optimizations (Merkle trees and Merkle proofs), and a bunch of fancy peer-to-peer networking stuff. But that's a subject for another, more technical blog post.

The point is this: **blockchains are a genuinely new tool for organizing complex systems**. And we are only beginning to understand how to integrate them into the real world.

## The promise of blockchains
If everyone works off the same blockchain, and everyone openly shares what the current state of the blockchain is, and it's computationally intractable to tamper with it, and everyone agrees on rules of how new data is committed&hellip; then suddenly everything changes.

Suddenly you can build completely decentralized systems that require no trust among participants. So long as enough actors in the system follow the rules of the protocol (in the most primitive case, at least 50% of them are good), then you can imbue the system with provable security guarantees. Conspiracies or bad actors can't censor or vandalize the system.

You can even engineer the right incentives straight into the protocol, and then have every actor in the system enforce them.

Using blockchains, a lot of massive coordination problems simply disappear. Conundrums that plague global financial infrastructure, voting, international remittances, insurance policies, custodial records, and even government corruption can simply be designed out of existence.

By creating the right system with the right guarantees, you can fix bad incentives. You can eliminate corrupt middle-men and rent-seekers. You can create whole new societies that can coordinate better, more transparently, and more efficiently than ever before considered possible.

**It's really hard for most people to grasp the significance of this.**

I'll put it this way: if John Locke knew about blockchains, it undoubtedly would've compelled him to write a third treatise on government. It would've been a revolutionary idea in how to coordinate a society.

## The future of the future
Most people I know right now in Silicon Valley are focused on deep learning and AI as the most promising technological revolution. And I share their enthusiasm! Deep learning is going to upend industries and give us new capabilities that we only imagined in high science fiction.

But blockchain—blockchain is going to upend entire societies. It's going to enable new kinds of governance systems that were before only the daydreams of utopians and philosophers.

And yet, when you look at the cryptocurrency world right now, you're not necessarily going to recognize that.

Most of what's going on right now falls into two categories.

The first are the crypto-anarchists and hackers who are building low-level protocols. They're racing to build what will become the decentralized TCP/IP stack for future builders.

The second category are the profiteers who trying to make a quick buck off the unaware and the optimistic.

Unfortunately, this second category is getting most of the attention.

## The tower of Blockchain
![tower of Babel](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Pieter_Bruegel_the_Elder_-_The_Tower_of_Babel_%28Vienna%29_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/1200px-Pieter_Bruegel_the_Elder_-_The_Tower_of_Babel_%28Vienna%29_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg)
Imagine stumbling across the world wide web in 1995, browsing through dinky fan sites catering to eccentrics, and thinking: "Hah. Wow. This weird little ecosystem is going to be really important someday."

That was blockchain a few years ago. In other words, blockchain has safely crossed the Angelfire chasm.

Now that it has proven its first glimmer of usefulness, the next act is inevitable.

You may have heard about the [ICO mania](https://medium.com/blockchannel/understanding-the-ethereum-ico-token-hype-429481278f45), or the recent rallies of [the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/). The wise and the wily have taken notice and have realized blockchain's tremendous potential. And they've already made and lost fortunes speculating on the potential future of cryptocurrencies.

![Crypto prices](http://i.imgur.com/OlfsjU9.png)

It's unfortunate that right now, blockchain-as-speculation is dominating most people's attention. The signal is getting drowned in the noise.

But that's to be expected. We've seen this before.

When people first realized the extraordinary potential of the internet, tons of money was pumped into random dot coms. Anticipating mass adoption and astronomical value creation, speculation fed speculation, [until the frenzy finally crashed in 2001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble).

What's going on right now is comparable. There will eventually be a comedown.

But when the dust is cleared, like after the dot com crash, those who were serious—the Microsofts, the Amazons, the Googles—will have to come in and do the graceless work of building the future.

There's much work to do.

I recently left my job at Airbnb. I was working on payments fraud for a little over a year. It was fascinating and impactful work—Airbnb is an awesome company—and I left on good terms. But the more I've been learning about crypto and blockchains, the more I'm convinced that this stuff is going to change the world.

And that's why I'm going to be working on the blockchain. (And probably keep blogging about it!)

For now, thanks for reading.

title: A hacker stole $31M of Ether—how it happened and what it means for Ethereum
tags: [blockchain, programming]

---

Yesterday, a hacker pulled off the second biggest heist in the history of digital currencies.

Around 12:00 PST, an unknown attacker exploited a critical flaw in the Parity multi-signature wallet on the Ethereum network, draining three massive wallets of over $31,000,000 worth of Ether in a matter of minutes. Given a couple more hours, the hacker could've made off with over $180,000,000 from vulnerable wallets.

But someone stopped them.

![Hacker](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*l0L_X-wFPpb3YHJ0Oqxp_Q.png)

Having sounded the alarm bells, a group of benevolent white-hat hackers from the Ethereum community rapidly organized. They analyzed the attack and realized that there was no way to reverse the thefts, yet many more wallets were vulnerable. Time was of the essence, so they saw only one available option: **hack the remaining wallets before the attacker did.**

By exploiting the same vulnerability, the white-hats [hacked all of the remaining at-risk wallets](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1dba1131000664b884a1ba238464159892252d3a) and drained their accounts, effectively preventing the attacker from reaching any of the remaining $150,000,000.

*Yes, you read that right.*

To prevent the hacker from robbing any more banks, the white-hats wrote software to rob all of the remaining banks in the world. Once the money was safely stolen, they began the process of returning the funds to their respective account holders. The people who had their money saved by this heroic feat are now in the process of retrieving their funds.

It's an extraordinary story, and it has significant implications for the world of cryptocurrencies.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MNIOdEWdqvI">[video]</div>

**It's important to understand that this exploit was not a vulnerability in Ethereum or in Parity itself.** Rather, it was a vulnerability in the default smart contract code that the Parity client gives the user for deploying multi-signature wallets.

This is all pretty complicated, so to make the details of this clear for everyone, this post is broken into three parts:

1. **What exactly happened?** An explanation of Ethereum, smart contracts, and multi-signature wallets.
2. **How did they do it?** A technical explanation of the attack (specifically for programmers).
3. **What now?** The attack's implications about the future and security of smart contracts.

If you are familiar with Ethereum and the crypto world, you can skip to the second section.

## 1. What exactly happened?

There are three building blocks to this story: **Ethereum**, **smart contracts**, and **digital wallets**.

![Ethereum](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*J_yJEaeQXUZ_Wk2w5sQXuQ.png)

**[Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/)** is a digital currency invented in 2013—a full 4 years after the release of Bitcoin. It has since grown to be the second largest digital currency in the world by market cap—$20 billion to Bitcoin's $40 billion.

Like all cryptocurrencies, Ethereum is a descendant of the Bitcoin protocol and improves on Bitcoin's design. But don't be fooled: though it is a digital currency like Bitcoin, Ethereum is much more powerful.

While Bitcoin uses its blockchain to implement a ledger of monetary transactions, Ethereum uses its blockchain to record state transitions in a gigantic distributed computer. Ethereum's corresponding digital currency, `ether` is essentially a side effect of powering this massive computer.

To put it another way, *Ethereum is literally a computer that spans the entire world*. Anyone who runs the Ethereum software on their computer is participating in the operations of this world-computer, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Because the EVM was designed to be [Turing-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) (ignoring gas limits), it can do almost anything that can be expressed in a computer program.

Let me be emphatic: *this is crazy shit*. The crypto world is ebullient about the potential of Ethereum, which has seen its value skyrocket in the last 6 months.

![Ethereum price chart](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*cGo4ezL9EPH_jGqsj3QS_Q.png)

The developer community has rallied behind it, and there's a lot of excitement about what can be built on top of the EVM—and this brings us to smart contracts.

**Smart contracts** are simply computer programs that run on the EVM. In many ways they are like normal contracts, except they don't need lawyers or judges to interpret them. Instead, they are compiled to bytecode and interpreted unambiguously by the EVM. With these programs, you can (among other things) programmatically transfer digital currency based solely on the rules of the contract code.

Of course, there are things normal contracts do that smart contracts can't—smart contracts can't easily interact with things that aren't on the blockchain. But smart contracts can also do things that normal contracts can't, such as enforce a set of rules entirely through unbreakable cryptography.

This leads us to the notion of **wallets**. In the world of digital currencies, wallets are how you store your assets. You gain access to your wallet using essentially a secret password, also known as your private key ([simplified a bit](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/asymmetric-cryptography)). There are many different types of wallets that confer different security properties, such as withdrawal limits. One of the most popular types is the multi-signature wallet.

In a multi-signature wallet, there are several private keys that can unlock the wallet, but just one key is not enough to unlock it. If your multi-signature wallet has 3 keys, for example, you can specify that at least 2 of the 3 keys must be provided to successfully unlock it. This means that if you, your father, and your mother are each signatories on this wallet, even if a criminal hacked your mother and stole her private key, they could still not access your funds. This leads to much stronger security guarantees, so multi-sigs are a standard in wallet security.

This is the type of wallet the hacker attacked.

So what went wrong? Did they break the private keys? Did they use a quantum computer, or some kind of cutting-edge factoring algorithm?

Nope, all the cryptography was sound. The exploit was almost laughably simple: they found a programmer-introduced bug in the code that let them re-initialize the wallet, almost like restoring it to factory settings. Once they did that, they were free to set themselves as the new owners, and then walk out with everything.

## 2. How did this happen?

What follows is a technical explanation of exactly what happened. If you're not a developer, you can skip to the next section, as this is going to be programming-heavy.

Ethereum has a fairly unique programming model. On Ethereum, you write code by publishing contracts (which you can think of as objects), and transactions are executed by calling methods on these objects to mutate their state.

In order to run code on Ethereum, you need to first deploy the contract (the deployment is itself a transaction), which costs a small amount of Ether. You then need to call methods on the contract to interact with it, which costs more Ether. As you can imagine, this incentivizes a programmer to optimize their code, both to minimize transactions and minimize computation costs.

One way to reduce costs is to use libraries. By making your contract call out to a shared library that was deployed at a previous time, you don't have to re-deploy any shared code. In Ethereum, keeping your code DRY will directly save you money.

The default multi-sig wallet in Parity did exactly this. It held a reference to a shared external library which contained wallet initialization logic. This shared library is referenced by the public key of the library contract.

```javascript
// FIELDS
address constant _walletLibrary = 0xa657491c1e7f16adb39b9b60e87bbb8d93988bc3;
```

The library is called in several places, via an EVM instruction called `DELEGATECALL`, which does the following: for whatever method that calls `DELEGATECALL`, it will call the same method on the contract you're delegating to, but using the context of the current contract. It's essentially like a `super` call, except without the inheritance part. (The equivalent in JavaScript would be `OtherClass.functionName.apply(this, args)`.)

Here's an example of this in their multi-sig wallet: the `isOwner` method just delegates to the shared wallet library's `isOwner` method, using the current contract's state.

```javascript
function isOwner(address _addr) constant returns (bool) {
  return _walletLibrary.delegatecall(msg.data);
}
```

This is innocent enough. The multi-sig wallet itself contained all of the right permission checks, and they were sure to rigorously enforce authorization on all sensitive actions related to the wallet's state.

But they made one critical mistake.

Solidity allows you to define a "fallback method". This is the method that gets called when there's no method that matches a given method name. You define it by not giving it a name:

```javascript
function() {
  // do stuff here for all unknown methods
}
```

The Parity team decided to let any unknown method that sent Ether to the contract just default to depositing the sent Ether.

```javascript
function() payable {
  // payable is just a keyword that means this method can receive/pay Ether

  if (msg.value > 0) {
    // just being sent some cash?
    Deposit(msg.sender, msg.value);
  }
  throw;
}
```

But they took it a step further, and herein was their critical mistake. Below is the *actual code that was attacked*.

```javascript
function() payable {
  // just being sent some cash?
  if (msg.value > 0)
    Deposit(msg.sender, msg.value);
  else if (msg.data.length > 0)
    _walletLibrary.delegatecall(msg.data);
}
```

Basically:

* If the method name is not defined on this contract...
* And there's no ether being sent in the transaction...
* And there is some data in the message payload...

Then it will call the exact same method if it's defined in `_walletLibrary`, but in the context of this contract.

Using this, the attacker called a method called `initWallet()`, which was not defined on the multisig contract *but was* defined in the shared wallet library:

```javascript
function initWallet(address[] _owners, uint _required, uint _daylimit) {
  initDaylimit(_daylimit);
  initMultiowned(_owners, _required);
}
```

Which calls the `initMultiowned` method...

```javascript
function initMultiowned(address[] _owners, uint _required) {
  m_numOwners = _owners.length + 1;
  m_owners[1] = uint(msg.sender);
  m_ownerIndex[uint(msg.sender)] = 1;
  for (uint i = 0; i < _owners.length; ++i)
  {
    m_owners[2 + i] = uint(_owners[i]);
    m_ownerIndex[uint(_owners[i])] = 2 + i;
  }
  m_required = _required;
}
```

Do you see what just happened there? The attacker essentially **reinitialized the contract** by delegating through the library method, overwriting the owners on the original contract. They and whatever array of owners they supply as arguments will be the new owners.

Given that they now control the entire wallet, they can trivially extract the remainder of the balance. And that's precisely what they did.

The initWallet: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x707aabc2f24d756480330b75fb4890ef6b8a26ce0554ec80e3d8ab105e63db07

The transfer:
https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9654a93939e98ce84f09038b9855b099da38863b3c2e0e04fd59a540de1cb1e5

So what was ultimately the vulnerability? You could argue there were two. First, the `initWallet` and `initMultiowned` in the wallet library were not marked as `internal` (this is like a `private` method, which would prevent this delegated call), and those methods did not check that the wallet wasn't already initialized. Either check would've made this hack impossible.

The second vulnerability was the raw `delegateCall`. You can think of this as equivalent to a raw `eval` statement, running on a user-supplied string. In an attempt to be succinct, this contract used metaprogramming to proxy potential method calls to an underlying library. The safer approach here would be to whitelist specific methods that the user is allowed to call.

The trouble, of course, is that this is more expensive in gas costs (since it has to evaluate more conditionals). But when it comes to security, we probably have to get over this concern when writing smart contracts that move massive amounts of money.

*So that was the attack.*

It was a clever catch, but once you point it out, it seems almost elementary. The attacker then jumped on this vulnerability for three of the largest wallets they could find—but judging from the transaction times, they were doing this entirely manually. The white-hat group was doing this at scale using scripts, and that's why they were able to beat the attacker to the punch. Given this, it's unlikely that the attacker was very sophisticated in how they planned their attack.

You might ask the question though—why don't they just roll back this hack, like they did with the [DAO hack](https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/the-dao-the-hack-the-soft-fork-and-the-hard-fork/)?

Unfortunately that's not really possible. The DAO hack was unique in that when the attacker drained the DAO into a child DAO, the funds were frozen for many days inside a smart contract before they could be released to the attacker.

This prevented any of the stolen funds from going into circulation, so the stolen Ether was effectively siloed. This gave the Ethereum community plenty of time to conduct a public quorum about how to deal with the attack.

In this attack, the attacker immediately stole the funds and could start spending them. A hard fork would be impractical–what do you do about all of the transactions that occur downstream? What about the people who innocently traded assets with the attacker? Once the ether they've stolen gets laundered and enters general circulation, it's like counterfeit bills circulating in the economy—it's easy to stop when it's all in one briefcase, but once everyone's potentially holding a counterfeit bill, you can't really turn back the clock anymore.

So the transaction won't get reversed. The $31M loss stands. It's a costly, but necessary lesson.

So what should we take away from this?

## 3. What does this attack mean for Ethereum?

There are several important takeaways here.

**First, remember, this was not a flaw in Ethereum or in smart contracts in general. Rather, it was a developer error in a particular contract.**

So who were the crackpot developers who wrote this? They should've known better, right?

[The developers here](https://blog.parity.io/the-multi-sig-hack-a-postmortem/) were a cross-collaboration between the Ethereum foundation (literally the creators of Ethereum), the Parity core team, and members of the open-source community. It underwent extensive peer review. This is basically the highest standard of programming that exists in the Ethereum ecosystem.

These developers were human. They made a mistake. And so did the reviewers who audited this code.

I've read some comments on Reddit and HackerNews along the lines of: "What an obvious mistake! How was it even possible they missed this?" (Ignoring that the "obvious" vulnerability was introduced in January and only now discovered.)

When I see responses like this, I know the people commenting are not professional developers. For a serious developer, the reaction is instead: *damn, that was a dumb mistake. I'm glad I wasn't the one who made it.*

Mistakes of this sort are **routinely** made in programming. All programs carry the risk of developer error. We have to throw off the mindset of "if they were just more careful, this wouldn't have happened." At a certain scale, carefulness is not enough.

As programs scale to non-trivial complexity, you have to start taking it as a *given* that programs are probably not correct. No amount of human diligence or testing is sufficient to prevent all possible bugs. Even organizations like Google or NASA make programming mistakes, despite the extreme rigor they apply to their most critical code.

We would do well to take a page from site reliability practices at companies like Google and Airbnb. Whenever there's a production bug or outage, they do a postmortem analysis and distribute it within the company. In these postmortems, there is always a principle of *never blaming individuals*.

Blaming mistakes on individuals is pointless, because all programmers, no matter how experienced, have a nonzero likelihood of making a mistake. Instead, the purpose of a postmortem is to identify what in the process allowed that mistake to get deployed.

The problem was not that the developer forgot to add `internal` to the wallet library, or that they did a raw `delegateCall` without checking what method was being called.

**The problem is that their programming toolchain allowed them to make these mistakes.**

As the smart contract ecosystem evolves, it has to evolve in the direction of making these mistakes harder, and that means making contracts secure by default.

This leads me to my next point.

**Strength is a weakness** when it comes to programming languages. The stronger and more expressive a programming language is, the more complex its code becomes. Solidity is a very complex language, modeled to resemble Java.

*Complexity is the enemy of security*. Complex programs are more difficult to reason about and harder to identify edge cases for. I think that languages like [Viper](https://github.com/ethereum/viper) (maintained by Vitalik Buterin) are a promising step in this direction. Viper includes by default basic security mechanisms, such as bounded looping constructs, no integer overflows, and prevents other basic bugs that developers shouldn't have to reason about.

The less the language lets you do, the easier it is to analyze and prove properties of a contract. Security is hard because the only way to prove a positive statement like "this contract is secure" is to disprove every possible attack vector: "this contract cannot be re-initialized," "its funds cannot be accessed except by the owners," etc. The fewer possible attack vectors you have to consider, the easier it is to develop a secure contract.

A simpler programming model also allows things like [formal verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification) and automatic test generation. These are areas under active research, but just as smart contracts have incorporated cutting-edge cryptography, they also should start incorporating the leading edge of programming language design.

There is a bigger lesson here too.

Most of the programmers who are getting into this space, myself included, come from a web development background, and the blockchain toolchain is designed to be familiar for web developers. Solidity has achieved tremendous adoption in the developer community because of its familiarity to other forms of programming. In a way, this may end up being its downfall.

The problem is, **blockchain programming is fundamentally different from web development**.

Let me explain.

Before the age of the client-server web model, most programming was done for packaged consumer software or on embedded systems. This was before the day of automatic software updates. In these programs, a shipped product was final—you released one form of your software every 6 months, and if there was a bug, that bug would have to stand until the next release. Because of this longer development cycle, all software releases were rigorously tested under all conceivable circumstances.

Web development is far more forgiving. When you push bad code to a web server, it's not a big deal if there's a critical mistake—you can just roll back the code, or roll forward with a fix, and all is well because you control the server. Or if the worst happens and there's an active breach or a data leak, you can always stop the bleeding by shutting off your servers and disconnecting yourself from the network.

*These two development models are fundamentally different.* It's only out of something like web development that you can get the motto "move fast and break things."

Most programmers today are trained on the web development model. Unfortunately, the blockchain security model is more akin to the older model.

In blockchain, code is intrinsically unrevertible. Once you deploy a bad smart contract, anyone is free to attack it as long and hard as they can, and there's no way to take it back if they get to it first. Unless you build intelligent security mechanisms into your contracts, if there's a bug or successful attack, there's no way to shut off your servers and fix the mistake. Being on Ethereum by definition means *everyone* owns your server.

A common saying in cybersecurity is "attack is always easier than defense." Blockchain sharply multiplies this imbalance. It's far easier to attack because you have access to the code of every contract, know how much money is in it, and can take as long as you want to try to attack it. And once your attack is successful, you can potentially steal *all of the money* in the contract.

Imagine that you were deploying software for vending machines. But instead of a bug allowing you to simply steal candy from one machine, the bug allowed you to simultaneously steal candy from every machine in the world that employed this software. Yeah, that's how blockchain works.

In the case of a successful attack, defense is extremely difficult. The white-hats in the Parity hack demonstrated how limited their defense options were—there was no way to secure or dismantle the contracts, or even to hack back the stolen money; all they could do was hack the remaining vulnerable contracts before the attacker did.

This might seem to spell a dark future.

*But I don't think this is a death knell for blockchain programming.* Rather, it confirms what everyone already knows: this ecosystem is young and immature. It's going to take a lot of work to develop the training and discipline to treat smart contracts the way that banks treat their ATM software. But we're going to have to get there for blockchain to be successful in the long run.

This means not just programmers maturing and getting more training. It also means developing tools and languages that make all of this easier, and give us rigorous guarantees about our code.

It's still early. Ethereum is a work in progress, and it's changing rapidly. You should not treat Ethereum as a bank or as a replacement for financial infrastructure. And certainly you should not store any money in a [hot wallet](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hot_wallet) that you're not comfortable losing.

But despite all that, I still think Ethereum is going to win in the long run. And here's why: **the developer community in Ethereum is what makes it so powerful**.

Ethereum will not live or die because of the money in it. It will live or die based on the developers who are fighting for it.

The league of white-hats who came together and defended the vulnerable wallets didn't do it for money. They did it because they believe in this ecosystem. They want Ethereum to thrive. They want to see their vision of the future come true. And after all the speculation and the profiteering, it's ultimately these people who are going to usher the community into its future. They are fundamentally why Ethereum will win in the long run—or if they abandon Ethereum, their abandonment will be why it loses.

This attack is important. It will shake people up. It will force the community to take a long, hard look at security best practices. It will force developers to treat smart contract programming with far more rigor than they currently do.

But this attack hasn't shaken the strength of the builders who are working on this stuff. So in that sense it's a temporary setback.

In the end, attacks like this are good for the community to grow up. They call you to your senses and force you to keep your eyes open. It hurts, and the press will likely make a mess of the story. But every wound makes the community stronger, and gets us closer to really deeply understanding the technology of blockchain—both its dangers, and its amazing potential.

P.S. If you’re a dev and you want to learn more about smart contract security, [this is a really good resource](https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices#known-attacks).

*Errata: This article originally said that Gavin Wood was the developer of the contract, which is incorrect. Gavin is the founder of Parity and pushed the fix to the contract, but was not the original developer. It also originally claimed that $77M additional funds were vulnerable, but this doesn’t count all of the ERC20 (ICO) tokens that were vulnerable. The total amount is actually $150,000,000+ if you include all ERC20 tokens. As of the time of writing this (July 21st 4PM EST), the total value of the assets saved by the white-hats was $179,704,659.*

title: The Limits of Poker Theory

&ldquo;Poker theory&rdquo; is inherently seductive. In a game full of chaos and uncertainty, poker theory beckons to us, promising comprehensibility and control. But while theory is powerful, it is not a panacea. That's not to say that theory in and of itself is flawed&mdash;rather, that *we* are.

Human beings are only boundedly rational. We are merely approximations of logical thinkers. And yet, we often take it for granted that in any situation, theory will show us a path to the answer.

In this article, we will analyze the limits of poker logic. First, we will look at the nature of heuristics and the function it plays in our cognition. Then we will begin to trace the boundaries of poker language, establish the difference between narrative and discrete poker logic, and lastly, deconstruct the way that poker arguments work in the real world.

It is critically important that we are attentive to our language, and the way we use concepts to guide our decisions. There is a temptation to think about theory in poker the same way one thinks of theory in physics, or some other hard science. By the end of this article, I will demonstrate that theory, for the most part, serves a profoundly weaker (and ultimately different) function in poker.

## The Power of Heuristics

Most of our play in poker is unconscious. This is true even when we are playing our A-games.

We have spoken before of playing on &ldquo;autopilot,&rdquo; as though autopilot is a deviation from your normal poker game. To be more exact, autopilot is more like the *skeleton* of your normal game. Your &ldquo;autopilot&rdquo;&mdash;that is, your unconsciously competent skillset&mdash;is always running in the background when you're playing poker. It's just that when you're on your A-game, there's a lot of conscious activity buzzing on the topmost layer. But your unconscious autopilot is always running beneath it; that remains constant, even when you're playing really well.

Our attention, then, is with that topmost layer&mdash;what is filled into the skeleton when we are consciously thinking about our play. Several things change when we are playing well, including our employment of skills that we haven't unconsciously mastered, frequently accompanied by an increase in patience, but that's not what we're going to focus on now. Instead, we want to look at the stream of internal dialogue that is running through our head.

The chief characteristic of poker theory is that it is mediated through language. So any engagement with poker theory will almost always be processed through our conscious brain. (To be more exact, it is mediated by symbols, including mathematical and linguistic ones).

When we are on our A-game, we are constantly invoking **heuristics**. A heuristic is, to put it simply, a kind of rule of thumb. It is a not-quite-perfect-but-good-enough script that we follow and usually gives us good results. A practical (albeit rather specific) heuristic would be something like, &ldquo;don't check-raise bluff a board like A49r, just float it,&rdquo; or &ldquo;never c-bet air on QT7s,&rdquo; or something more general, such as &ldquo;in a SA/WB situation, try to minimize the pot size.&rdquo; A heuristic is not a mental breakdown of a hand&mdash;it is merely a prefabricated rule to help you get to the answer to a hand that you don't know on an unconscious level.

How do we know when we're using a heuristic, rather than &ldquo;just making plays&rdquo;? After all, we are constantly making good decisions in poker when autopiloting. Most of those decisions are purely unconscious. The mark of using a heuristic rather than merely using our poker perception is that there will usually be some conscious, linguistic thinking involved. If the phrase &ldquo;SA/WB&rdquo; pops into your head, or &ldquo;draw-heavy,&rdquo; or whatever mental language that you happen to use to describe these situations&mdash;this is an indicator that you're invoking a heuristic. They don't always have to be explicitly linguistic; they may be merely symbolic. But for the most part, if you're paying attention, it's easy to spot when you're using a heuristic.

Heuristics are ubiquitous in how we play poker. For every spot where we haven't achieved unconscious mastery, it would take impractically long for us to fully process every scenario and figure out the best play. Heuristics are, in a sense, pre-formulated, simplified rules that help us quickly process many of these situations and approximate the best answer. They work pretty well most of the time. But because they are so widespread, we must be very attentive to how we use them. Bad, unexamined heuristics are often the source of some of our most consistent mistakes.

For example, one heuristic I inattentively used for a long time related to overbets. Whenever a good player overbet, I almost always assumed they were valuebetting. If you asked me why I assumed this, I likely would've cited the language that went along with my heuristic: &ldquo;an overbet is a risky and unpredictable bet, so people usually make it when they're sure of their hand.&rdquo;

Now, certainly, this qualifies as a rationale. It is poker-logical, so to speak. But it's important to note that I wasn't *thinking this through* every time I folded to an overbet. I was simply consulting this heuristic that I had and applying it (or, after long enough, not even remembering the heuristic and simply unconsciously folding to overbets because I perceived them as strong). Consulting a heuristic is a mental shortcut; it simplifies the processing of a hand to conserve our mental energy, which is always limited when playing a long session, multi-tabling, or battling a difficult opponent. But such a lack of reflection makes heuristics an easy place to solidify bad play. In reality, good players *were* overbetting me with bluffs, but because my heuristic was so entrenched, it took me some time to realize this and discard it.

Every player has some of his consistent mistakes and biases embedded into his arsenal of heuristics. This is why creativity and defying your mental walls are so important: in order to break your suboptimal heuristics (which are usually quite old and deeply ingrained), you must go over them with a magnifying glass, to *really* see them for what they are, and then to systematically challenge them. To become a great poker player, you must constantly put your heuristics under assault, and replace old heuristics with newer and sturdier ones.

## Not all Theory is Created Equal

We might say that heuristics are prefabricated molds of theory. They are not theory in and of themselves; heuristics are static. We don't &ldquo;do&rdquo; heuristics, we merely remember them. But they usually derive from theory in some way. So now let's turn to theory itself.

There are two fundamental types of theory. The first is **discrete theory**. Discrete theory is the type of theory that you likely think about when you imagine poker theory. It is discrete, mathematical, and involves things like delineating hand ranges, combinatorials, GTO analysis, breakdowns of stats, and so on. It's the type of thing you do in PokerEV or PokerStove. It involves math, modeling, and explicit assumptions.

Contrary to the popular image, discrete theory is a miniscule part of the poker theory that we actually use.

By far, the largest chunk of poker theory we use is not discrete. It is rather what I call **narrative theory**. Narrative theory is *not* mathematical, but descriptive. It tells a story. It is not scientific, logical, or deterministic&mdash;it is literary. A narrative does not outline all of its assumptions or convert a hand into an analytical model. Instead, it uses established conventions to tell a narrative that leads toward the answer. Narrative theory lies somewhere between heuristic and discrete theory. And it is, by far, the most commonly used type of theory. I would conjecture that almost all of the theoretical thinking that we engage in is narrative. And yet, few acknowledge its role in shaping our approach to poker.

It is comforting to pretend that all theory is equally robust. But if it is true that the vast majority of poker thinking is narrative rather than discrete, then our faith in the comprehensibility of poker is unearned. It suggests that the vast majority of poker theory (and our understanding of this game) is *not* necessarily scientific, logical, or deterministic. Poker becomes more an art than a science. And that is a deeply uncomfortable thought for those who want to believe in the chess game of poker.

## The Arc of Narrative Theory

Take this nugget of theory, taken from an actual explanation of a poker hand (the context is unimportant): &ldquo;His range here is weak, and he just lost a couple big pots, so this is a good spot to bluff.&rdquo; This seems on its face like valid reasoning, doesn't it? This is a very typical example of what is going through our heads when we're thinking about poker&mdash;and this is also very typical narrative theory.

Narrative theory has a few hallmarks:

- It is not immediately&mdash;or sometimes ever–falsifiable. That is, it's difficult to point out a single fact that proves any narrative to be incorrect.
- It tends not to explicitly state the assumptions and variables on which it hinges.
- It tends to be much more concise than discrete theory.

To discretely analyze a spot involves complex math, the mapping of assumptions and forking paths through a hand. Narrative theory collapses these complexities. And, as it turns out, that is precisely where its strength lies.

Let's go back to that original explanation. &ldquo;His range here is weak, and he just lost a couple big pots, so this is a good spot to bluff.&rdquo; But let's say that perhaps the opponent knows his range is weak, and thus will be calling more. Or, what if losing big pots is going to make him more call-y? These are two possible counter-narratives that would directly challenge this one. The question is this: how do we decide between them? There are no numbers to compare, nothing to multiply or divide, no pot odds to analyze. How do we decide between the first narrative: &ldquo;villains who just lost big pots tend to call more,&rdquo; and &ldquo;villains who just lost big pots tend to give up more&rdquo;? In a very real way, both of these are valid. If the line of reasoning went, instead: &ldquo;his range here is weak, but he knows that and he just lost a couple big pots, so he's likely to call down light here,&rdquo; this story would also sound rather convincing, wouldn't it?

It can be infuriating, but such ambiguity is inherent to the nature of narrative theory. The strength of narrative theory is its ability to transform a hand into a story&mdash;a simplified narrative that efficiently organizes and condenses the information in a hand. Imagine if we laid out all of the assumptions behind something like &ldquo;I'm going to slowplay my set here because a raise would look too strong.&rdquo; We'd have to first say what his range is going into this hand, what our range is, how we think he'll perceive a turn flat, the likelihood that he'll bluff or valuebet any given river card, how he is going to react to a turn raise, and so on and so forth. Really, when it comes down to it, actually *breaking down* a hand is enormously complex. It involves a lot of paperwork. Narrative theory is, in a sense, a kind of deferral. A form of shorthand.

Behind narrative theory lies the claim, &ldquo;there is some discrete theory that justifies this. I don't have it on me, and I can't show it to you now, but it exists somewhere.&rdquo; Actually doing that discrete theory during a poker hand would be prohibitively taxing, in terms of mental processing and of time. We can't discretely analyze every hand we play. So we must take shortcuts. Narrative theory is the only practical way that we, as human beings, can efficiently organize and recall our knowledge of poker theory.

But how do we actually *generate* a thread of narrative theory?

Narrative theory is composed of building blocks, which we might call **poker memes**. Things like &ldquo;checking back for pot control,&rdquo; or &ldquo;maximizing stack-to-pot ratio,&rdquo; or &ldquo;extracting max value,&rdquo; or &ldquo;betting to induce a bluff.&rdquo; These memes describe interpretations of events in a hand which we, poker theory users, view as valid. That is, these are things that really happen in a hand&mdash;they have a discrete theoretical basis. That does not mean that they happened in *this particular hand you're describing*, but we all agree those are things that happen. They are valid memes. Here are some (usually) invalid memes: &ldquo;I raised for information,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I bet because he was challenging me,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I folded because the hand might be tricky.&rdquo; We don't consider these reasons to be grounded in discrete theory, so we dismiss them. As you can imagine, the language of valid narrative theory has changed as poker has evolved.

Thus, narrative theory is a social phenomenon. It is created by the community of poker players who want to talk about poker, and it is through the poker community that we regulate what is valid narrative theory and what is not. They have a genetic quality&mdash;generally, very strong players (especially vocal ones who make videos or talk openly about their poker thinking) create new memes and foreclose less useful ones, and most other players tend to follow their example. Thus, changes in narrative theory disseminate through the poker community, *not through poker itself*, not through playing or changes in gameplay, but in *social and linguistic changes* that are amplified by prominent community members.

Narrative theory is, in a way, much more interesting and organic than discrete theory. Discrete theory should be the same for two people a world apart, even if they're in totally different player pools. But narrative theory is always different. It is fluid and changing. It adapts to the needs and worldviews of its users. Reading a forum thread from top players just five or six years ago reveals just how much narrative theory has changed in recent years.

For my own part, one realization that came to me later on in my poker career was this: one of the most valuable things that is communicated through poker videos (and the reason why they're invaluable for learning) is that they are so good at teaching narrative theory. In fact, most of what I think I gave away in all of the videos I was making was not actually my poker strategy, or the individual plays I made. I think the usefulness of my videos lay, instead, in *how* I talked about poker. Think about it. There are some videos that discretely analyze situations in hands, break things down into math and PokerEV and so on, but really, they are the minority&mdash;the majority of videos see a hand, quickly give a narrative explanation, and then move on.

Of course, once you start to see this, your instinct might be to think that you're getting ripped off. Discrete theory is what you really want, isn't it? On the contrary. One of the most powerful things we learn from videos is *how better to apply narrative theory*.

Narrative theory is much more important than discrete theory when it comes to regulating our play because we rarely have the time to apply discrete theory during an actual hand! If 95% of our play is regulated by narrative theory, then simply being able to listen to other people's narrative theory, examining and regurgitating their language, and internalizing the *rules* with which they combine and chain together memes, we learn to become better at narrative theory. If Phil Galfond checks back top pair on a flop, his breaking down the math and discretely analyzing the hand is, actually, of little value. But what is immensely valuable is learning the memes, the rules of narrative theory that Phil Galfond is applying, and learning to apply them yourself. It is a curious thing&mdash;you take a bad player, teach him to simply *talk* about poker better, and he suddenly becomes a better player.

Narrative theory is not deterministic. By learning the language of a better player, such as a coach or a videomaker, you won't necessarily play like him. But listening to and engaging with such a coach may teach you how to tell stories like him&mdash;a concept known in psychology as **scaffolding**. Your coach's style of narrative theory emphasizes the a particular hierarchy of concepts&mdash;embedded within his language is his idea of what concepts are most important in a hand, which things to look for first, and which patterns should trigger which responses. In the same way our parents engage in scaffolding to teach us how to tell stories as children (e.g., &ldquo;and why did Billy do that? How did that make you feel? And then what did you do?&rdquo;), getting coaching and watching videos guides us toward constructing good poker narratives in much the same way.

It would be incorrect to claim, however, that narrative theory is *all* that we're doing when we're playing poker. There is also some discrete theory involved, especially as your game improves to a high level. Estimating pot odds, analyzing how to optimize against a given hand (given certain assumptions about his play), logical hand-elimination to narrow down his range, or even holistically strategizing on how to allocate your hand range in a certain spot&mdash;these things may well fall under the purview of discrete theory, which strong players are continually applying during their play. But no matter what level you're at, narrative theory is always the dominant mode of theory we employ in poker hands. There is simply no other method as efficient at encoding the large swathes of information contained in poker. Narrative theory is, in a very real sense, the human answer to complexity.

## Arguing over Stories

So let's say that you begrudgingly accept the validity of narrative theory as I've presented it. Okay, you say, maybe this is how it works. So what?

I've been very steadfast in claiming that narrative theory has many advantages, and is essential to our ability to parse the complexity of poker. But, of course, narrative theory has its drawbacks.

Inherent to its nature, narrative theory cannot be logically argued. There are some narrative disputes that can be resolved verbally, such as demonstrating two inconsistent memes were strung together, breaking the rules of narrativity. For example, there might be a narrative that includes both &ldquo;he couldn't've had a draw on the flop, because he loves to checkraise them&rdquo; and &ldquo;on the river he never bluffs big, so he had to have hit his draw.&rdquo; The rules of narrative theory disallow this combination, and others. Inconsistencies like this, however, are not terribly common once you reach a certain level of mastery over poker theory.

More often, when people are arguing about a poker narrative, it is not resolved by the narratives themselves. After all, narratives are incommensurate&mdash;they cannot be evaluated objectively, and each participant believes their own narrative (it should be no surprise that when we share hands, we always label ourselves the hero and our opponent the villain).When such disputes arise, they are often resolved by an appeal to authority&mdash;the players will go to a third party, another trusted poker player, to decide which narrative is best aligned with authority.

In fact, once you start seeing this phenomenon, you will start seeing it everywhere&mdash;especially in poker forums. What is a typical strategy thread, after all? An opening poster shows a hand, and then every subsequent poster takes a shot at communicating their own narrative of what's going on in the hand. This should seem like chaos, and yet usually when we read such a thread, we have an idea of which narrative &ldquo;won.&rdquo; How do we decide that?

There are three ways. First, if there is no consensus, we tend to ally ourselves with the narrative that most closely resembles our own. Second, if there is a consensus, then we choose the narrative that is most popular with the best players (which is a sign of fitness). This is often the way that narrative theory works. We observe a narrative somewhere in the wild, and from the fact that it's alive and well&mdash;by the evolutionary principle&mdash;we assume it must be strategically fit.

This is the basis of what I call **ecological learning.** There are three fundamental modes of learning in poker: learning through theory, learning via experience, and learning through observing others&mdash;ecological learning. Through this type of learning, you learn from &ldquo;what's out there&rdquo; or &ldquo;what people are doing&rdquo; (under the presumption that weak strategies would be culled out from the population). Thus, through ecological learning, popularity is an effective measure of a theory's fitness. Going back to the forum thread&mdash;the third possibility is that a poker authority weighs in to choose among these narratives, or possibly offer his own (which, if he does, we take as an even stronger sign of fitness). Let's say, for example, that Sauce or Jungleman weighs in. If they say something like &ldquo;this is a definite fold,&rdquo; this doesn't really qualify as narrative theory, it's simply a stand-in for a statement like this: &ldquo;this is a fold, and I've done (either explicitly or intuitively) the data analysis that tells me on average, folding is better than calling/raising.&rdquo; But if they offer their own explanation of the hand, then their narrative inevitably becomes the dominant one that later posters accept.

Rarely are these things decided by application of discrete theory, comparing mathematical models of the hands and assumptions and so on. Really, once you look at it this way, the art of poker argument can seem almost simplistic.

As a student of poker, if you were anything like I was, you will get into many arguments about poker. When you find something you disagree with, or which doesn't seem to make sense to you, it is good to challenge it. Debating poker theory will nourish your mind. But, especially as a developing player, you should be wary of arguments that begin and end in narrative theory.

At its core, all of narrative theory carries with it an implied warranty. The warranty is: &ldquo;somewhere out there, someone did some discrete theory to prove this works.&rdquo; Usually, this warranty goes unquestioned. But if you are engaged in a debate about poker, it is time for you to call this out. When someone makes a narrative claim that you deeply disagree with&mdash;challenge them to prove it. Don't accept it at their word! Or, if you have good reason to trust their authority, then take the time to prove it to yourself. As much as I've been stressing narrative theory as essential to our development, the ability to do discrete theory is important as well. Especially now, as poker evolves and games get more and more rigorous, the precision in strategy that can be captured by narrative theory is often not enough.

To reach the highest levels, you must gain a mastery of both discrete and narrative theory. And the only way to do that is to practice them. Learn how to run simulations. Learn how to use PokerEV, or StoxEV. If you don't know how to run basic programs like PokerStove, or how to do fold equity calculations, or how to calculate a GTO river strategy&mdash;learn them. Knowledge of discrete theory only bolsters your narrative theory, and helps you to know which structures in your poker game are sound, and which are more suspect.

Discrete analysis is the bedrock of theory, always. In the end, narrative theory is merely a stand-in, and so you must be willing to not only call others out when their stories don't add up, but also to scrutinize the concepts you employ in your own game. Narrative theory is merely the roadmap we sketch atop the true terrain of discrete theory.

But there are some situations which, no matter how hard we try, are insuperably complex, and cannot be broken down by discrete theory. PLO has many such situations. When you have a pair and a mediocre draw on a flop, is it better to lead out, or check/call? Is it better to flat it in a 3-bet pot, or raise the flop? What if stacks are deep? All of these variables will certainly affect the answer&mdash;but we don't know *how*. We have no idea where any of the cut-offs are for these variables, because PLO is such a combinatorially complex game, which makes mapping out a decision tree effectively impossible.

I remember once getting into a very tricky PLO flop situation. I couldn't figure out how to analyze the hand, so I took it to a number of world-class PLO players I knew. To my surprise, I kept getting different answers from anyone on the best way to play it&mdash;on the flop, one of the earliest streets, it baffled me that there could be so much disagreement! I was frustrated, but also fascinated. In reality, nobody who I took the hand to could actually break down the hand either&mdash;mathematically, it would be overwhelmingly complex to even try. The only way to defend a particular way of playing the hand was narratively. Essentially, I realized I was being told two different stories&mdash;and the only way I could decide between them was to pick one and go with it.Even with all its complications and imperfections, we need narrative theory. Although it can seem hopelessly convoluted at times, we have no alternative but to engage in the circus of narrativity, debate, and reason-giving. You must embrace the way that poker works. Only then can you navigate the world as it is, and develop your skills as a poker player.

You could say that, in a sense, it's incidental that math can model poker. After all, you can mathematically model the physics behind tennis, but physics has little to do with the process of learning tennis. I suspect that the same is largely true of poker. Most of the learning that we do in poker has little to do with the chess match. What we are playing is something vague and large, it is played in large strokes of thoughts, it is not transmitted through equations and proofs, but through stories and emulation. If poker couldn't be modeled by mathematics, then storytelling would be all we'd have to make sense of the game. Perhaps that's closer to reality than we think.

In the end, poker theory tells us about a lot more than just poker. It tells us about ourselves, the way our minds work, and the way that we interact with other members of our community. In the next article, we are going to look at this latter phenomenon, with an eye toward the practical. What kind of relationship should we have with the poker community? Poker is an intensely isolating and isolated profession, and yet, we would be helpless without a community of peers to guide our learning in the right direction. In the next article, I will discuss the poker community, and how to successfully develop and foster a poker network, and how to stay sane in a less-than-sane culture.

title: Ten Rules for Negotiating a Job Offer
tags: [tech careers]

When [the story of how I landed a job at Airbnb](https://haseebq.com/farewell-app-academy-hello-airbnb-part-i/) went viral, I was surprised at how infatuated people were with my negotiations. Media stories portrayed me as some kind of master negotiator&mdash;a wily ex-poker-player who was able to con the tech giants into a lucrative job offer.

This is silly. It's silly for a lot of reasons, but one of the main ones is that in reality, my negotiation skills are nothing special. There are lots of job candidates who are better negotiators than I, to speak nothing of recruiters and other professional negotiators.

It just so happens that most people don't negotiate at all, or if they do, they just negotiate just enough to satisfy themselves that they did.

Worse yet, most of the advice out there on negotiation is borderline useless. Almost anything you read on the subject will be a vague and long-winded exhortation to &ldquo;make sure you negotiate&rdquo; and &ldquo;never say the first number.&rdquo; Beyond those two morsels of advice, you're pretty much on your own.

<div class="ui embed" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v1xrgXHfrFo/">[video]</div>

I thought to myself: why is there so little actionable advice out there about negotiation? I suspect it's because deep down, many people believe that negotiation is inexplicable, that it's something some people can do and others can't, and that there's no real way to break it down so anyone can learn it.

I say that's bullshit. Negotiation is a skill that can be learned just like any other, and I don't believe it's particularly elusive or hard to understand. So I'm going to try to explain how anyone can do it.

Three caveats.

First: I'm not an expert. There are people who really are experts at this, and when my advice contradicts theirs, you should assume I'm wrong.

Second: negotiation is tricky to generalize about because it's deeply intertwined with social dynamics and power. The appropriate advice for an Asian male in Silicon Valley may not be appropriate for a black woman in Birmingham, Alabama. Racial, sexual, and political dynamics accompany you to the negotiating table.

At the same time, I want to caution against overemphasizing these factors. Being afraid to negotiate out of fear of discrimination can often be just as deleterious as discrimination itself.

Ceteris paribus, negotiate aggressively.

Third: I'm the first to admit that negotiation is stupid. It's a practice that inherently benefits those who are good at it, and is an absurd axis on which to reward people. But it's a reality of our economic system. And like most collective action problems, we're probably not going to be able to abolish it any time soon. In which case, you might as well improve at it.

So here's my guide to negotiation. It's going to be split into two parts: this first part will be about conceptualizing the negotiating process, about how to begin the process and set yourself up for maximal success. The second part will be advice on the actual back-and-forth portion of negotiating and how to ask for what you want.

Let's take it from the top.

## What it means to &ldquo;get a job&rdquo;

In our culture we call entering the employment market &ldquo;trying to get a job.&rdquo; This is an unfortunate turn of phrase. &ldquo;Getting a job&rdquo; implies that jobs are a resource out in the world, and you're attempting to secure one of these resources. But that's completely backwards. What you are actually doing is selling your labor, and a company is bidding for it.

**Employment is just striking a mutual deal in the labor market.**

Like any market, the labor market only functions well if it's competitive. This is the only way to ensure fair and equitable pricing. Imagine you were a farmer selling watermelons. Would you just sell your watermelons to the first buyer who agreed to purchase them? Or would you survey the marketplace of buyers, see the best price (and business partner) you could get, and then make an informed decision on which buyer to sell to?

And yet, when people talk about the labor market, they think &ldquo;oh, a company wants to *give me a job*! What a relief!&rdquo; As though having a job were in itself some special privilege for which a company is the gatekeeper.

Dispel yourself of this mindset.

A job is just a deal. It is a deal between you and a company to exchange labor for money (and other things you value).

This might sound like an abstract point, but you should absolutely approach negotiation from this perspective.

## The role of negotiation

Negotiating is a natural and expected part of the process of trying to make a deal. It's also a signal of competence and seriousness. Companies generally respect candidates who negotiate, and most highly attractive candidates negotiate (if for no other reason, because they often have too many options to choose from).

At the risk of spouting truisms: always, always negotiate. Doesn't matter how good or bad you think you are. You never damage a relationship by negotiating.

In all my time as an instructor at App Academy, out of hundreds of offers negotiated, only once or twice were offers ever rescinded in negotiations. It basically never happens. And when it does, usually the candidate was being an unconscionable asshole, or the company was imploding and needed an excuse to rescind the offer.

You might think to yourself: &ldquo;*well, I don't want to set high expectations, and the offer is already generous, so I ought to just take it.*&ldquo;

**No. Negotiate.**

Or maybe: &ldquo;*I don't want to start off on the wrong foot and look greedy with my future employer.*&ldquo;

**No. Negotiate.**

&ldquo;*But this company is small and&mdash;*&ldquo;

**No. Shut up. Negotiate.**

We'll talk more in the next section about why a lot of these objections are bullshit, and fundamentally misapprehend the dynamics of hiring. But for now, just trust me that you should always negotiate.

## The ten rules of negotiating

I've tried to boil down negotiation to ten rules. The rules, in order of appearance, are:

1. Get everything in writing
2. Always keep the door open
3. Information is power
4. Always be positive
5. Don't be the decision maker
6. Have alternatives
7. Proclaim reasons for everything
8. Be motivated by more than just money
9. Understand what they value
10. Be winnable

We'll only get through some of these in this blog post, and the rest will appear in the second part. But I'll explain each rule as we get to it.

So let's start from the top and try to walk through a negotiation process from the very beginning. For most, that starts when you receive an offer.

## The offer conversation

You've just received the phone call: your interview went well, and after much deliberation they decided they like you. They want to make you an offer. Congratulations!

Don't get too excited though. The fun is just getting started.

Thank your recruiter. Sound excited&mdash;hopefully this won't be hard. Before jumping into details, try to ask for specific feedback on your interview performance. If they give it to you, this will help you gauge how much they want you, as well as tell you things you can improve on in your next interview(s).

Now time to explore the offer.

**Rule #1 of negotiating: have everything in writing.**

Eventually, they'll give you information about the offer. Write it all down. Doesn't matter if they're going to send you a written version later, **write everything down**. Even if there are things that are not directly monetary, if they relate to the job, write them down. If they tell you &ldquo;we're working on porting the front-end to Angular,&rdquo; write that down. If they say they have 20 employees, write that down. You want as much information as you can. You'll forget a lot of this stuff, and it's going to be important in informing your final decision.

Depending on the company, they'll also tell you about the equity package. We'll look more specifically at equity in part II, but be sure to write everything down.

The rule from here on out is that everything significant you discuss will have some kind of a paper trail. Often, the company won't even send you an official offer letter until a deal is finalized. So it falls to you to confirm all of the important details in subsequent e-mails.

So yadda yadda, lots of details, writing stuff down, oh there's a joke, time to laugh. Now the recruiter is done talking and you're done asking all of your questions.

Your recruiter will now say something along the lines of &ldquo;*so what do you think?*&ldquo;

This seems innocuous, but your reply here is critical, because there's a lot you can say to weaken your position. This is your first decision point.

A decision point is a moment in the negotiation where your interlocutor wants to compel you to make a decision. If they succeed in tying you to a position, they will close the door on further negotiating. Of course &ldquo;what do you think?&rdquo; is a subtle prod. But it is the beginning of many attempts to get you to make a premature commitment.

**This leads to rule #2 of negotiating: always keep the door open.** Never give up your negotiating power until you're absolutely ready to make an informed, deliberate final decision.

This means your job is to traverse as many of these decision points as possible without giving up the power to continue negotiating. Very frequently, your interlocutor will try to trick you into making a decision, or tie you to a decision you didn't commit to. You must keep verbally jiu-jitsu-ing out of these antics until you're actually ready to make your final decision.

## Protecting information

There's an uncomfortable silence by now, and their &ldquo;*what do you think?*&rdquo; is hanging in the air.

If you say &ldquo;*yes, that sounds amazing, when do I start?*&rdquo; you implicitly accept the offer and completely close the door on the negotiation. This is your recruiter's number one favorite thing to hear. It stands to reason you probably shouldn't do this.

But their second favorite thing to hear you say is &ldquo;*can you do 90K instead of 85K?*&rdquo; This also closes the door, but for a different and more subtle reason. And it's the number one reason why most people suck at negotiation.

**Rule #3 of negotiating: information is power.** To protect your power in the negotiation, you must protect information as much as possible.

A company doesn't give you insight into what it's thinking. It doesn't tell you its price range, how much it paid the previous candidate with your experience, or anything like that. It intentionally obfuscates those things. But it wants you not to do the same.

A company wants to be like a bidder in a secret auction. But unlike the other bidders, it wants to know exactly how high all of the other bids are. It then openly intends to exploit that knowledge, often by bidding one cent more than the second highest bid.

Yeah, no. Screw that. It's a silent auction, and to keep it that way, you must protect information.

In many situations, the only reason why you have any negotiating power at all is because the employer doesn't actually know what you're thinking. They might not know how good your other offers are, or how much you were making in your last job, or how you weigh salary vs equity, or even how rational you are as a decision-maker. Bottom line, you want them to be uncertain on exactly what it would take to sign you.

When you say &ldquo;*can you do 90K instead of 85K,*&rdquo; you've told them exactly what it will take to make you sign. The sheet's pulled back, the secret auction is up, and they're going to bid 90K (or more likely, 87K). And they know there's almost no risk in doing so, because you'll probably accept.

What if you were the kind of person who wouldn't even consider an offer below 110K? Or the kind of person who wouldn't consider an offer below 120K? If you were, you wouldn't ask for 90K, and if they offered it as conciliation, you'd tell them to stop wasting your time.

By staying silent, *they don't actually know which of those kinds of people you are.* In their mind, you could be any of the three.

A corollary of this rule is that you should not reveal to companies what you're currently making. There are some exceptions, but as a rule you should assume this. If you must divulge what you're making, you should be liberal in noting the total value of your package (incorporate bonuses, unvested stock, nearness to promotion etc.), and always mention it in a context like &ldquo;*[XYZ] is what I'm currently making, and I'm definitely looking for a step up in my career for my next role.*&ldquo;

Companies will ask about your current compensation at different stages in the process&mdash;some before they ever interview you, some after they decide to make you an offer. But be mindful of this, and protect information.

So given this offer, don't ask for more money or equity or anything of the sort. Don't comment on any specific details of the offer except to clarify them.

Give away nothing. Retain your power.

Say instead: &ldquo;*Yeah, [COMPANY_NAME] sounds great! I really thought this was a good fit, and I'm glad that you guys agree. Right now I'm talking with a few other companies so I can't speak to the specific details of the offer until I'm done with the process and get closer to making a decision. But I'm sure we'll be able to find a package that we're both happy with, because I really would love to be a part of the team.*&ldquo;

Think like the watermelon farmer. This offer is just is the first businessman who's stopped by your watermelon patch, glanced over your crops, and announced &ldquo;I'll take all of these right now for $2 a melon.&rdquo;

Cool. It's a big market, and you're patient&mdash;you're a farmer after all. Just smile and tell them you'll keep their offer in mind.

And this is super important: always be unequivocally positive.

## The importance of positivity

**Staying positive is rule #4 of negotiation**. Even if the offer is shit, it's extremely important to remain positive and excited about the company. This is because *your excitement is one of your most valuable assets in a negotiation.*

A company is making you an offer because they think you'll do hard work for them if they pay you. If you lose your excitement for the company during the interview process, then they'll lose confidence that you'll actually want to work hard or stay there for a long time. Each of those makes you less attractive as an investment. Remember, you are the product! If you become less excited, then the product you're selling actually loses value.

Imagine you were negotiating with someone over buying your watermelons, but the negotiation took so long that by the time you'd reached an agreement, your watermelons had gone bad.

Companies are terrified of that. They don't want their candidates to go bad during a negotiation. Hence why they hire professional recruiters to manage the process and make sure they remain amicable. You and the recruiter share the same interest in that regard. If a company feels like you've gone bad, suddenly they're a lot less willing to pay for you.

So despite whatever is happening in the negotiation, give the company the impression that 1) you still like the company, and that 2) you're still excited to work there, even if the numbers or the money or the timing is not working out. Generally the most convincing thing to signal this is to reiterate you love the mission, the team, or the problem they're working on, and really want to see things work out.

## Don't be the decision-maker

You can wrap up the conversation now by saying:

> I'll look over some of these details and discuss it with my [FAMILY/CLOSE\\\\_FRIENDS/SIGNIFICANT\\\\_OTHER]. I'll reach out to you if I have any questions. Thanks so much for sharing the good news with me, and I'll be in touch!

So not only are you ending the conversation with the power all in your hands, but note there's another important move here: you're roping in other decision-makers.

**Rule #5 of negotiation: don't be the decision-maker.** Even if you don't particularly care what your friends/family/husband/mother thinks, by mentioning them, you're no longer the only person the recruiter needs to win over. There's no point in them trying to bully and intimidate you; the &ldquo;true decision-maker&rdquo; is beyond their reach.

This is a classic technique in customer support and remediation. It's never the person on the phone's fault, they're just some poor schmuck doing their job. It's not their decision to make. This helps to defuse tension and give them more control of the situation.

It's much harder to pressure someone if they're not the final decision-maker. So take advantage of that.

Okay!

We have our first offer. Send a follow-up e-mail confirming all of the details you discussed with your recruiter so you have a paper trail. Just say &ldquo;*just wanted to confirm I had all the details right.*&ldquo;

Groovy. Next step is to leverage this to land other offers and find the best deal we can find in the job market.

## Getting other offers

Turns out, it doesn't matter that much where your first offer is from, or even how much they're offering you. Just having an offer in hand will get the engine running.

If you're already in the pipeline with other companies (which you should be if you're doing it right), you should proactively reach out and let them know that you've just received an offer. Try to build a sense of urgency. Regardless of whether you know the expiration date, all offers expire at some point, so take advantage of that.

> Hello [PERSON],
>
> I just wanted to update you on my own process. I've just received an offer from [COMPANY] which is quite strong. That said, I'm really excited about [YOUR AMAZING COMPANY] and really want to see if we can make it work. Since my timeline is now compressed, is there anything you can do to expedite the process?

Should you specifically mention the company that gave you an offer? Depends. If it's a well-known company or a competitor, then definitely mention it. If it's a no-name or unsexy company, you should just say you received an offer. If it's expiring soon, you should mention that as well.

Either way, send out a letter like this to every single company you're talking to. No matter how hopeless or pointless you think your application is, you want to send this signal to everyone who is considering you in the market.

Second, if there are any other companies you are looking to apply to (whether through referral or cold application), or even companies at which you've already applied but haven't heard back, I would also follow up with a similar e-mail.

So why do this? Isn't this tacky, annoying, or even desperate?

None of the above. It is the oldest method in history to galvanize a marketplace&mdash;show that supplies are limited and build urgency. Demand breeds demand. Not every company will respond to this, but many will.

Isn't it stupid that companies respond to this though?

## Why companies care about other offers

[When I wrote about the story of my own job search](https://haseebq.com/farewell-app-academy-hello-airbnb-part-i/), I mentioned how having an offer from Google made companies turn around and expedite me through their funnels. Many commentators lamented at the capriciousness of these companies. If Uber or Twitch only talked to me because of Google and until then weren't willing to look at me, what did that say about their hiring processes? What legitimately are they evaluating, if anything at all?

I think this response is totally backwards. The behavior of tech companies here is actually very rational, and you would do well to understand it.

First, you must realize what a company's goal is. A company's goal is to hire someone who will become an effective employee and produce more value than their cost. How do you figure out who will do that? Well, you can't know for certain without actually hiring them, but there are a few proxies. Pedigree is the strongest signal; if they did it at other companies, they can probably do it at yours. And if someone trusted within the organization can vouch for them, that's often a strong signal as well.

But turns out, almost everything else is a weak signal. Weak in the sense that it's just not very reliable. Interviews, if you think about it, are long, sweaty, uncomfortable affairs that only glancingly resemble actual employment. They're weird and can't tell you that much about whether an individual will be a good at their job. There's no way around this. There are a few stronger signals, like bringing someone in for a week or two on a contract-to-hire position, but strong candidates won't consider this. So candidates as a whole have effectively forced companies to assume almost all of the risk in hiring.

The truth is, knowing that someone has passed your interview just doesn't say *that much* about whether they'll be a good employee. It's as though you knew nothing about a student other than their SAT score. It's just not a lot of data to go off.

Nobody has solved this problem. Not Google nor anyone else.

And this is precisely why it's rational for companies to care that you've received other offers. They care because each company knows that their own process is noisy, and the processes of most other companies are also noisy. But a candidate having multiple offers means that they have multiple weak signals in their favor. Combined, these converge into a much stronger signal than any single interview. It's like knowing that a student has a strong SAT score, and GPA, and won various scholarships. Sure, it's still possible that they're a dunce, but it's much harder for that to be true.

This is not to say that companies respond proportionally to these signals, or that they don't overvalue credentials and brands. They do. But caring about whether you have other offers and valuing you accordingly is completely rational.

So this is all to say&mdash;tell other companies that you've received offers. Give them more signal so that they know you're a valued and compelling candidate. And understand why this changes their mind about whether to interview you.

As you continue interviewing, remember to keep practicing your interview skills. The single strongest determinant of your final offer will be the number and strength of offers that you receive.

## Some advice on timing

You want to be strategic about the timing of your offers. Generally, you should try to start interviewing at larger companies earlier. Their processes are slower and their offer windows are wider (meaning they allow you more time to decide). Startups are the other way around.

Your goal should be to have as many offers overlapping at the same time as possible. This will maximize your window for negotiating.

When you receive an offer, often the first thing you should ask for is more time to make your decision. Especially in your first offer, more time is by far the most valuable thing you can ask for. It's time that enables you to activate other companies and end up with the strongest possible offer. So be prepared to fight for time.

## How to approach exploding offers

Hoo boy.

Exploding offers are offers that expire within 24-72 hours. You won't see this much at big companies, but they're becoming increasingly common among startups and mid-sized companies.

Exploding offers suck, and I share most people's disdain for this practice. But I do understand it. Exploding offers are a natural weapon for employers to combat a strong hiring market for tech workers. Companies know exactly what they're doing with exploding offers&mdash;they play on fear and limit your ability to seek out counteroffers.

In a sense, it's unsurprising that if startups have more difficulty attracting and securing talent, they'd resort to this practice. What I don't like is the dishonesty about it. Employers often justify this by saying &ldquo;*If you need more time than this, then that's a sign you're not the kind of person we're looking for.*&ldquo;

Please don't buy this crap or feel guilty over it. They're simply doing this to improve their chance of closing candidates. Needing more than three days to make a life decision isn't a sign of anything other than thoughtfulness.

So what should you do if you receive an exploding offer?

Exploding offers are anathema to your ability to effectively navigate the labor market. Thus, there is only one thing to do. Treat the offer as a non-offer unless the expiration window is widened.

In no uncertain terms, convey that if the offer is exploding, it's useless to you.

Example conversation:

> I have one big concern. You mentioned that this offer explodes in 48 hours. I'm afraid this doesn't work at all for me. There's no way that I can make a decision on this offer within a 48 hour window. I'm currently wrapping up my interview process at a few other companies, which is likely to take me another week or so. So I'm going to need more time to make an informed decision.

If they push back and say this is the best they can do, then politely reply:

> That's really unfortunate. I like [YOUR COMPANY] and was really excited about the team, but like I said, there's no way I can consider this offer. 48 hours just too unreasonable of a window. The next company I join will be a big life decision for me, and I take my commitments very seriously. I also need to consult with my [EXTERNAL\\\\_DECISION\\\\_MAKER]. There's no way that I can make a decision I'm comfortable with in this short an amount of time.

Pretty much any company will relent at this point. If they persist, don't be afraid to walk away over it. (They probably won't let that happen, and will come grab you as you're walking out the door. But if they don't, then honestly, screw 'em.)

I was given several exploding offers during my job search. And every time, I did essentially this. Every single offer immediately widened to become more reasonable, sometimes by several weeks.

I want to emphasize, lest I be misunderstood here&mdash;what I'm saying is not to just silently let an exploding offer expire, and assume that everything will be fine and they'll still hire you. They won't. For exploding offers to be a credible weapon, a company has to have a reputation of enforcing them. I'm saying explicitly call this out as an issue when they make the offer.

Don't let a company bully you into giving away your negotiating power.

## The Negotiating Mindset

Before we enter into the actual back-and-forth, I want to examine the mindset you should have as a negotiator. This applies not just to how you approach the conversation, but also to how you think about the company.

Do not fall into the trap of valuing companies solely along one dimension. That means don't just value companies based on salary, equity, or even on prestige. Those are all important dimensions, but so are cultural fit, the challenge of the work, learning potential, later career options, quality of life, growth potential, and just overall happiness. None of these inherently trump any of the other. Anyone who tells you &ldquo;just choose wherever you think you'll be happiest&rdquo; is being just as simplistic than someone who says &ldquo;just choose the one that offers the most money.&rdquo; All of these things matter, and your decision should be genuinely multi-dimensional.

Be open to being surprised as you explore different companies.

It's also important to understand that companies don't all value you along the same dimension either. That is, different companies are genuinely looking for different skills, and there are some companies at which you will be more and less valuable. Even at peer companies this is true, especially so if you have a specialized skill-set.

The more companies you talk to, the more likely you are to find a company to which you are significantly more valuable than the rest. Chances are this is where you'll be able to negotiate your strongest offer. It might surprise you which company this turns out to be; keep an open mind, and remember that a job search is a 2-sided process.

One of the most valuable things you can do for yourself in this process is to really try to understand how employers think and what motivates them. Understanding your interlocutor is extremely important in negotiation, and we'll be exploring that a lot in the next blog post.

But most of all I want to emphasize: be curious about the other side. Try to understand why employers think the way they do. Be sympathetic toward them. Care about what they want and help them try to get it. Adopting this mindset will make you a much stronger negotiator, and accordingly, a much better employee and team member.

Okay. That's as far as we're going for today. In the next blog post, I'm going to cover the last four rules of negotiation. I'll also go over the actual back-and-forth process&mdash;how to ask for what you want, how to strengthen offers, and how to dismantle the tricks that companies will try to pull on you. Also a lot more on the theory of negotiation, which I really dig.
