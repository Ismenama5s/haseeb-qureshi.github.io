- Did you add a YAML value with a colon or dash in it? E.g., `title: Cool Title: Common Syntax Error - Yes` Wrap it in quotes: `"Cool Title: Common Syntax Error - Yes"`.
- Did you change `_config.yml`? Check the indentation and quotes.
- Is the change you made not showing up? Clear your cache and check `.gitignore`.
- Is a link broken? Does it have too many or too few forward slashes somewhere?
